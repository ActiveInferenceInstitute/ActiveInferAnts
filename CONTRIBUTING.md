# Contributing to ActiveInferAnts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ActiveInferAnts! This project thrives on community contributions, and we welcome everyone to help improve and expand our understanding of Active Inference and ant colony behavior. Below, you'll find guidelines on how you can contribute.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to ActiveInferAnts:

- **Report Bugs**: If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp/issues) with detailed information about the bug, steps to reproduce it, and your environment setup.

- **Implement Features or New Methods**: We are always looking to expand the capabilities of pymdp. If you have an idea for a new feature or method, start by opening an issue to discuss it.

- **Improve Documentation**: Good documentation is crucial. Feel free to submit PRs focused on fixing, improving, or refactoring documentation.

- **Submit Feedback**: Open an issue to send feedback. Be as detailed as possible, explaining why the feature is desirable and how it would work.

## Getting Started

Before you start coding, make sure to set up your environment properly:

1. Act to clone or fork the repository.
2. Infer what project dependencies need to be installed.
3. Serve the niche through interaction & co-enactment.  

## Making Changes

1. Choose an algorithm or feature you want to work on and open an issue to discuss your plans.
2. After discussion, start coding. Make sure to follow the Pythonic naming conventions and write clean, readable code.
3. Add or update tests for the new feature or fix.
4. Update the documentation to reflect your changes or additions.

## Submitting Changes

1. Stage your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
2. Pull the latest changes from the upstream repository and resolve any conflicts.
3. Push your changes to your fork.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) against the upstream repository. For detailed instructions, see [here](ActiveInferAnts/9_OTHER/pymdp/CONTRIBUTING.md#L168-L186).

## Review Process

After submitting your PR, the maintainers will review your changes. Some automated tests will run to ensure your code is compatible. You might be asked to make some changes. Once everything is set, your PR will be merged.
