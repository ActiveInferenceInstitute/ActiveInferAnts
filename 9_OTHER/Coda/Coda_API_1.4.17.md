Coda API (1.4.17)
API Support: help+api@coda.io
URL: https://coda.io
License: Coda Developer Terms

Introduction
The Coda API is a RESTful API that lets you programmatically interact with Coda docs:

- List and search Coda docs
- Create new docs and copy existing ones
- Share and publish docs
- Discover pages, tables, formulas, and controls
- Read, insert, upsert, update, and delete rows

We reserve the right to remove older APIs and functionality with a 3-month deprecation notice. Changes and new features will be announced in the Developers Central section of our Community, and in the API updates doc.

Getting Started
Our Getting Started Guide helps you learn the basics of working with the API and shows a few ways you can use it, including:

- Reading data from Coda tables and writing back to them
- Building a one-way sync from one Coda doc to another
- Automating reminders
- Syncing your Google Calendar to Coda

Using the API
Coda's REST API is designed to be straightforward to use. You can use any language and platform to make requests. Tools like Postman or Insomnia can help you get a feel for the API.

API Endpoint
This API uses a base path of https://coda.io/apis/v1.

Resource IDs and Links
Each resource instance retrieved via the API has the following fields:

- id: The resource's immutable ID
- type: The type of resource
- href: A fully qualified URI for the resource

Most resources can be queried by their name or ID. We recommend using IDs where possible, as names can be changed by users.

List Endpoints
Endpoints supporting listing of resources have the following fields:

- items: An array of listed resources, limited by query parameters
- nextPageLink: API link to the next page of results, if available
- nextPageToken: Page token for the next page of results, if available

The maximum page size may change at any time. Use the nextPageToken to check for more results, rather than relying on a specific result set size.

Doc IDs
While most object IDs must be discovered via the API, you may often need to get the ID of a specific Coda doc. Use the provided Doc ID Extractor tool to easily extract the ID from a Coda doc URL.

Rate Limiting
The Coda API has rate limits on requests per minute. Exceeding these limits will result in HTTP 429 errors. Current rate limits (subject to change without notice):

- Reading data: 100 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing data: 10 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing doc content: 5 requests per 10 seconds
- Listing docs: 4 requests per 6 seconds
- Reading analytics: 100 requests per 6 seconds
API scripts should implement retry logic for HTTP 429 errors.

Consistency
API edits may take a few seconds to become available. These endpoints return an HTTP 202 status code and a requestId, which can be used with the #getMutationStatus endpoint to check the edit status.

For the most up-to-date data when retrieving doc data, use the X-Coda-Doc-Version: latest header.

Volatile Formulas
Coda's "volatile" formulas (e.g., Today(), Now(), User()) behave differently with the API. Time-based values may only be current to the last doc edit, and user-based values may be blank or invalid.

Free and Paid Workspaces
The Coda API is available to all users free of charge, but API usage is subject to the user's role in the applicable workspace. For example, the #createDoc endpoint requires the API token owner to be a Doc Maker (or Admin) in the workspace.

Examples
This documentation provides code examples in Python, Unix shell, and Google Apps Script to help you get started with the Coda API.

Rate Limiting
The Coda API has rate limits on requests per minute. Exceeding these limits will result in HTTP 429 errors. Current rate limits (subject to change without notice):

- Reading data: 100 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing data: 10 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing doc content: 5 requests per 10 seconds
- Listing docs: 4 requests per 6 seconds
- Reading analytics: 100 requests per 6 seconds

Python examples
These examples use Python 3.6+. If you don't already have the requests module, use pip or easy_install to get it.

Shell examples
The shell examples are intended to be run in a Unix shell. If you're on Windows, you will need to install WSL.

These examples use the standard cURL utility to pull from the API, and then process it with jq to extract and format example output. If you don't already have it, you can either install it or run the command without it to see the raw JSON output.

Google Apps Script examples

Google Apps Script makes it easy to write code in a JavaScript-like syntax and access many Google products with built-in libraries. You can set up your scripts to run periodically, making it a good environment for writing tools without maintaining your own server.

Coda provides a library for Google Apps Script. To use it, go to Resources -> Libraries... and enter the following library ID: 15IQuWOk8MqT50FDWomh57UqWGH23gjsWVWYFms3ton6L-UHmefYHS9Vl. The library's source code is available here.

Google provides autocomplete for API functions and generated docs. Access these docs via the Libraries dialog by clicking on the library name. Required parameters included in the URL path are positional arguments in these functions, followed by the request body, if applicable. All remaining parameters can be specified in the options object.

OpenAPI/Swagger Spec
We offer an OpenAPI 3.0 specification to standardize our API and make it accessible:

- OpenAPI 3.0 spec - YAML
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec - JSON

Postman collection
To quickly prototype the API in Postman, use one of the links above to import the Coda API into a collection. Set the appropriate header and environment variables.

Client libraries
We currently support only Google Apps Script. To work with the Coda API, use standard network libraries for your language or the appropriate Swagger Generator tool to auto-generate Coda API client libraries. We do not guarantee compatibility of these autogenerated libraries with our API (e.g., some libraries may not work with Bearer authentication).

OpenAPI 3.0
Swagger Generator 3 can generate client libraries for these languages. It is relatively new and supports a limited set of languages.

Third-party client libraries
Some community members have written libraries to work with our API. These aren't officially supported by Coda but are listed here for convenience. (Let us know if you've written a library and would like it included here.)

- Node-RED by Mori Sugimoto
- NodeJS by Parker McMullin
- Ruby by Carlos MuÃ±oz at Getro

Docs
Coda docs are foundational, top-level collaborative projects that contain pages. The API lets you list and search your docs to obtain basic metadata like titles and ownership information.

List available docs
Returns a list of Coda docs accessible by the user. These are returned in the same order as on the docs page: reverse chronological by the latest event relevant to the user (last viewed, edited, or shared).

Coda API (1.4.17)
API Support: help+api@coda.io
URL: https://coda.io
License: Coda Developer Terms

Introduction
The Coda API is a RESTful API that lets you programmatically interact with Coda docs:

- List and search Coda docs
- Create new docs and copy existing ones
- Share and publish docs
- Discover pages, tables, formulas, and controls
- Read, insert, upsert, update, and delete rows

We reserve the right to remove older APIs and functionality with a 3-month deprecation notice. Changes and new features will be announced in the Developers Central section of our Community, and in the API updates doc.

Getting Started
Our Getting Started Guide helps you learn the basics of working with the API and shows a few ways you can use it, including:

- Reading data from Coda tables and writing back to them
- Building a one-way sync from one Coda doc to another
- Automating reminders
- Syncing your Google Calendar to Coda

Using the API
Coda's REST API is designed to be straightforward to use. You can use any language and platform to make requests. Tools like Postman or Insomnia can help you get a feel for the API.

API Endpoint
This API uses a base path of https://coda.io/apis/v1.

Resource IDs and Links
Each resource instance retrieved via the API has the following fields:

- id: The resource's immutable ID
- type: The type of resource
- href: A fully qualified URI for the resource

Most resources can be queried by their name or ID. We recommend using IDs where possible, as names can be changed by users.

List Endpoints
Endpoints supporting listing of resources have the following fields:

- items: An array of listed resources, limited by query parameters
- nextPageLink: API link to the next page of results, if available
- nextPageToken: Page token for the next page of results, if available

The maximum page size may change at any time. Use the nextPageToken to check for more results, rather than relying on a specific result set size.

Doc IDs
While most object IDs must be discovered via the API, you may often need to get the ID of a specific Coda doc. Use the provided Doc ID Extractor tool to easily extract the ID from a Coda doc URL.

Rate Limiting
The Coda API has rate limits on requests per minute. Exceeding these limits will result in HTTP 429 errors. Current rate limits (subject to change without notice):

- Reading data: 100 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing data: 10 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing doc content: 5 requests per 10 seconds
- Listing docs: 4 requests per 6 seconds
- Reading analytics: 100 requests per 6 seconds
API scripts should implement retry logic for HTTP 429 errors.

Consistency
API edits may take a few seconds to become available. These endpoints return an HTTP 202 status code and a requestId, which can be used with the #getMutationStatus endpoint to check the edit status.

For the most up-to-date data when retrieving doc data, use the X-Coda-Doc-Version: latest header.

Volatile Formulas
Coda's "volatile" formulas (e.g., Today(), Now(), User()) behave differently with the API. Time-based values may only be current to the last doc edit, and user-based values may be blank or invalid.

Free and Paid Workspaces
The Coda API is available to all users free of charge, but API usage is subject to the user's role in the applicable workspace. For example, the #createDoc endpoint requires the API token owner to be a Doc Maker (or Admin) in the workspace.

Examples
This documentation provides code examples in Python, Unix shell, and Google Apps Script to help you get started with the Coda API.

Rate Limiting
The Coda API has rate limits on requests per minute. Exceeding these limits will result in HTTP 429 errors. Current rate limits (subject to change without notice):

- Reading data: 100 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing data: 10 requests per 6 seconds
- Writing doc content: 5 requests per 10 seconds
- Listing docs: 4 requests per 6 seconds
- Reading analytics: 100 requests per 6 seconds

Python examples
These examples use Python 3.6+. If you don't already have the requests module, use pip or easy_install to get it.

Shell examples
The shell examples are intended to be run in a Unix shell. If you're on Windows, you will need to install WSL.

These examples use the standard cURL utility to pull from the API, and then process it with jq to extract and format example output. If you don't already have it, you can either install it or run the command without it to see the raw JSON output.

Google Apps Script examples

Google Apps Script makes it easy to write code in a JavaScript-like syntax and access many Google products with built-in libraries. You can set up your scripts to run periodically, making it a good environment for writing tools without maintaining your own server.

Coda provides a library for Google Apps Script. To use it, go to Resources -> Libraries... and enter the following library ID: 15IQuWOk8MqT50FDWomh57UqWGH23gjsWVWYFms3ton6L-UHmefYHS9Vl. The library's source code is available here.

Google provides autocomplete for API functions and generated docs. Access these docs via the Libraries dialog by clicking on the library name. Required parameters included in the URL path are positional arguments in these functions, followed by the request body, if applicable. All remaining parameters can be specified in the options object.

OpenAPI/Swagger Spec
We offer an OpenAPI 3.0 specification to standardize our API and make it accessible:

- OpenAPI 3.0 spec - YAML
- OpenAPI 3.0 spec - JSON

Postman collection
To quickly prototype the API in Postman, use one of the links above to import the Coda API into a collection. Set the appropriate header and environment variables.

Client libraries
We currently support only Google Apps Script. To work with the Coda API, use standard network libraries for your language or the appropriate Swagger Generator tool to auto-generate Coda API client libraries. We do not guarantee compatibility of these autogenerated libraries with our API (e.g., some libraries may not work with Bearer authentication).

OpenAPI 3.0
Swagger Generator 3 can generate client libraries for these languages. It is relatively new and supports a limited set of languages.

Third-party client libraries
Some community members have written libraries to work with our API. These aren't officially supported by Coda but are listed here for convenience. (Let us know if you've written a library and would like it included here.)

- Node-RED by Mori Sugimoto
- NodeJS by Parker McMullin

Docs
Coda docs are foundational, top-level collaborative projects that contain pages. The API lets you list and search your docs to obtain basic metadata like titles and ownership information.

List available docs
Returns a list of Coda docs accessible by the user. These are returned in the same order as on the docs page: reverse chronological by the latest event relevant to the user (last viewed, edited, or shared).

Rows
You'll likely use this part of the API the most. These endpoints let you retrieve row data from tables in Coda as well as create, upsert, update, and delete them. Most of these endpoints work for both base tables and views, but for inserting/upsering rows, you must use a base table.

List table rows
Returns a list of rows in a table.

Value results
The valueFormat parameter dictates in what format the API should return values for individual cells.

simple (default): Returns cell values as the following JSON values: string, number, or boolean. Array values (like multiselects) are returned as comma-delimited strings.
simpleWithArrays: Singleton values are returned as simple. Array values are returned as JSON arrays and the values within are simple values (including nested arrays).
rich: If applicable, returns many values with further encoding, allowing API users to have lossless access to data in Coda.
For text values, returns data in Markdown syntax. If the text field is simple text (e.g. has no formatting), the field will be fully escaped with triple-ticks. E.g ```This is plain text```
For currency, lookup, image, person and hyperlink values, the value will be encoded in JSON-LD format.
  // Currency
  {
    "@context": "http://schema.org",
    "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
    "currency": "USD",

AUTHORIZATIONS:

PATH PARAMETERS
docId
required
string
Example: AbCDeFGH
ID of the doc.

tableIdOrName
required
string
Example: grid-pqRst-U
ID or name of the table. Names are discouraged because they're easily prone to being changed by users. If you're using a name, be sure to URI-encode it.

QUERY PARAMETERS
query	
string
Example: query=c-tuVwxYz:"Apple"
Query used to filter returned rows, specified as <column_id_or_name>:<value>. If you'd like to use a column name instead of an ID, you must quote it (e.g., "My Column":123). Also note that value is a JSON value; if you'd like to use a string, you must surround it in quotes (e.g., "groceries").

sortBy	
string (RowsSortBy)
Enum: "createdAt" "natural" "updatedAt"
Specifies the sort order of the rows returned. If left unspecified, rows are returned by creation time ascending. "UpdatedAt" sort ordering is the order of rows based upon when they were last updated. This does not include updates to calculated values. "Natural" sort ordering is the order that the rows appear in the table view in the application. This ordering is only meaningfully defined for rows that are visible (unfiltered). Because of this, using this sort order will imply visibleOnly=true, that is, to only return visible rows. If you pass sortBy=natural and visibleOnly=false explicitly, this will result in a Bad Request error as this condition cannot be satisfied.

useColumnNames	
boolean
Example: useColumnNames=true
Use column names instead of column IDs in the returned output. This is generally discouraged as it is fragile. If columns are renamed, code using original names may throw errors.

valueFormat	
string (ValueFormat)
Enum: "simple" "simpleWithArrays" "rich"
The format that cell values are returned as.

visibleOnly	
boolean
Example: visibleOnly=true
If true, returns only visible rows and columns for the table.

limit	
integer >= 1
Default: 25
Example: limit=10
Maximum number of results to return in this query.

pageToken	
string
Example: pageToken=eyJsaW1pd
An opaque token used to fetch the next page of results.

syncToken	
string
Example: syncToken=eyJsaW1pd
An opaque token returned from a previous call that can be used to return results that are relevant to the query since the call where the syncToken was generated.

Responses
200 List of rows in the table.
RESPONSE SCHEMA: application/json
items
required
Array of objects (Row)
href	
string <url>
API link to these results

nextPageToken	
string (nextPageToken)
If specified, an opaque token used to fetch the next page of results.

nextPageLink	
string <url>
If specified, a link that can be used to fetch the next page of results.

nextSyncToken	
string (nextSyncToken)
If specified, an opaque token that can be passed back later to retrieve new results that match the parameters specified when the sync token was created.

Insert/upsert rows
Inserts rows into a table, optionally updating existing rows if any upsert key columns are provided. This endpoint will always return a 202, so long as the doc and table exist and are accessible (and the update is structurally valid). Row inserts/upserts are generally processed within several seconds. Note: this endpoint only works for base tables, not views. When upserting, if multiple rows match the specified key column(s), they will all be updated with the specified value.
