FOIA.gov Draft RESTful HTTPS API Spec
This is a draft spec for integrating the FOIA.gov portal with existing FOIA case management systems operated by individual agencies in the federal government. This work stems from the interviews and research that led to our FOIA Portal Discovery Recommendations.

Once an agency’s case management system supports this specification, it can receive FOIA requests directly from the FOIA.gov portal, rather than having the request data sent to the agency via e-mail.

To minimize agency effort, we’ve designed this spec so that some of the tedious bits of implementing an API can be handled by a service like api.data.gov, which provides a free API management service for federal agencies.

Change Log
Version 1.1.0
Add the new field “pdf”, to contain an object with file data for a PDF version of the request
Add the new field “testing”, to indicate when a request came from a non-production environment
Receive a FOIA Request
Notes
This draft does not address:

versioning
size or rate limits
error message/status code related to exceeded the rate limit
any subsequent calls to the internal FOIA.gov API (to capture info needed to subsequently retrieve status, for example)
detailed security controls
Security controls
Once we have confidence in our data models and the touch points for interoperability, we will be working with the security team at DOJ to ensure the Portal meets the federal requirements for security controls. For now, we include only some preliminary ideas based on the agency feedback we’ve received.

Each agency will be responsible for implementing security controls on their own end as per their agency regulations and authority to operate. This may include configuration of a web application firewall, anti-virus scanning of file attachments, and validation of HTTP headers.

HTTPS
Agency endpoints should be restricted to HTTPS only with valid TLS certificates. The Portal will validate your certificate as part of the HTTPS request.

Authentication
To ensure that your API and case management system aren’t publicly writable, we recommend restricting your API access to the FOIA.gov Portal. This can be done via a shared secret HTTP header token. You will provide this secret token to the Portal though configuration. Every request from the Portal will include this token in the HTTP header FOIA-API-SECRET, and your API should validate that it is the correct token.

Services like api.data.gov provide this authentication for you and give you additional options.

URL
There are no required parameters or format for your API URL. You may choose any pathname you wish. If your system handles requests for multiple agency components (common for decentralized agencies), we recommend using a URL structure that explicitly identifies the agency component receiving the FOIA request. Your URL should not contain any query parameters.

Recommended URL format for decentralized agencies:

/components/:id/requests/
Where id is a unique identifier for a component within your agency.

For example:

/components/88/requests/
But not:

/requests?component=88
In addition, we recommend hosting the API on a dedicated sub-domain like foia-api.agency.gov. Using this kind of pathname hierarchy allows us to add additional API endpoints for future development and features.

Method:
POST

URL parameters
Required:

id=[integer], where id is the unique identifier of the agency component that should receive the request.

Troubleshooting request failures
Various factors may cause a request submitted on FOIA.gov to an agency via API to fail. In these instances, the National FOIA Portal Administrator will inform the agency/component of the failure, and will pass along the error message. Agencies/components will coordinate with their tracking system vendor to analyze this error message and address the problem to prevent similar failures in the future. The following list contains common error messages that may be helpful in this analysis.

Additional info on CURL errors can be found here: libcurl - Error Codes.

Error message:	API URL for the component must use the HTTPS protocol.
Meaning:	The URL in the API configuration must be an https:// URL. Agency endpoints should be restricted to HTTPS only with valid TLS certificates. FOIA.gov will validate your certificate as part of the HTTPS request.
Error message:	Exception message: cURL error 28: Connection timed out after 30,001 milliseconds
Meaning:	Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to the conditions. FOIA.gov must receive a 200 Successful response from the tracking system within 30 seconds, otherwise it assumes the request failed to transmit and it will continue trying to send the request 5 times until it fatally fails.

Sometimes the request will actually submit and can be seen in the agency’s tracking system despite the failure on the FOIA.gov side resulting in 5 duplicate requests.

To address this, ensure that the 200 Success response is sent to FOIA.gov within 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds). This requirement is detailed in the “Response” section of the API Specs.
Error message:	Exception message: cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate (see https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html).
Error message:	cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
Error message:	cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate (see https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html).
Meaning:	Requests from FOIA.gov are sent over the public internet and do not have access to an agency’s private network or intranet. The SSL certificate installed on the API endpoint must use a trusted certificate authority (cannot be self-signed). The agency may need to update the certificate information.
Error message:	404 Current IP Address is not allowed
Meaning:	Agency endpoints may have an allowlist of IP addresses as a security protection. Sometimes the FOIA.gov IP address has not been added to that allowlist, the endpoint returns an error message similar to this. The appropriate fix is to add the FOIA.gov IP addresses to the allowlist. The error description should identify the IP address that needs to be added to the allowlist.
Error message:	Did not receive JSON response from component.
Meaning:	This means the response sent to FOIA.gov was not in application/JSON format or was not sent at all.
Error message:	API security token not matched.
Meaning:	Agency endpoints require a secret key as a security protection. Sometimes the secret key that FOIA.gov is using does not match what is expected by the agency endpoint, and the endpoint returns an error message similar to this. The appropriate fix is to compare the expected secret key with the actual secret key to ensure that they match.
Error message:	Maximum request length exceeded.
Meaning:	Some agency tracking systems may have a maximum length for fields. Some FOIA.gov request form fields have a 10,000 character limit by default. This error may also indicate that attachment fields are not set to accept files up to 20 MB by default. Confirm that the request_description, fee_waiver_explanation, and expedited_processing_reason fields in your tracking system accept up to 10,000 characters, and that attachments_supporting_documentation accept files up to 20MB. (See “Request Fields” above for parameters.)

Developer Resources
The FOIA request Portal is powered by a public API. In order to use the API, you must signup for an API key here. Visit the Swagger page to view the structure of the FOIA API.

If your agency is interested in receiving requests from the Portal via an API, please check out our Agency API spec and get in touch with us.

Agency Components
Agencies of the federal government submit information about their FOIA process in a machine-readable format to the Portal. This information is available through the Agency component API. This API follows the JSON API standard and leverages the Drupal JSON API module. The documentation for the JSON API module is a great resource.

The endpoint for the Agency component API.

https://api.foia.gov/api/agency_components
An agency component payload might look like this.

Examples
Request a list of agency components names.

curl -g -v -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' 'https://api.foia.gov/api/agency_components?&fields[agency_component]=title'
Fetch a list of agency components with their parent agency.

curl -g -v -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' 'https://api.foia.gov/api/agency_components?&include=agency&fields[agency]=name,abbreviation&fields[agency_component]=title,abbreviation,agency'
Fetch the Office of Information Policy.

curl -g -v -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' 'https://api.foia.gov/api/agency_components/8216158f-8089-431d-b866-dc334e8d4758?'
Fetch the Office of Information Policy’s FOIA request form.

curl -g -v -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' https://api.foia.gov/api/agency_components/8216158f-8089-431d-b866-dc334e8d4758/request_form
The FOIA XML Schema
Federal agencies publish FOIA information in accordance with guidelines prepared by the U. S. Department of Justice Office of Information Policy. These guidelines, available here, describe the format and meaning of FOIA annual report information. In addition, a FOIA Annual Report XML schema has been developed allowing agency FOIA annual report information to be represented and exchanged in a standardized format. This XML schema closely follows the structure and terminology of the guidance document, and conforms to the NIEM standard (http://niem.gov). 

All agency data available through reports and graphs on the FOIA.gov website is also available for public download as XML documents conforming to the FOIA Annual Report XML schema at the link below. This enables any kind of offline processing, storage, comparison, or mashup which may be desired.  

The entire IEPD package may also be downloaded directly by clicking on the following link [Download IEPD].

Within this IEPD package you can find the XML schema defined in exchange_files/schema/extension/FoiaAnnualReportExtensions.xsd. Note that this definition inherits from others, which can be found in the package as well, under exchange_files/schema/Subset/niem/.

You can download the FOIA Data Set here.

Annual Report XML API
Individual annual reports, in XML format, are available via an API endpoint:

/api/annual-report-xml/[agency abbreviation]/[year]

For example, to receive the Department of Justice (DOJ) annual report for 2021, you could use this:

curl -H 'X-API-Key: <your-api-key>' https://api.foia.gov/api/annual-report-xml/DOJ/2021
