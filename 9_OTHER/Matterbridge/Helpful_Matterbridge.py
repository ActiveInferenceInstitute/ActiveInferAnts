Matterbridge: Open-source chat bridge for multiple messaging platforms

Key features:
- Bridges multiple chat protocols/platforms
- Supports message edits, deletes, threading, attachments
- Username/avatar spoofing, private groups
- API for third-party integrations

Natively supported platforms:
Discord, Gitter, IRC, Matrix, Mattermost, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, XMPP, etc.

Third-party integrations via API:
Minecraft, Reddit, Facebook Messenger, etc.

Installation:
- Pre-built binaries available
- Can be built from source (Go 1.18+)
- Docker and package manager options

Configuration:
- TOML config file
- Supports multiple gateways/bridges
- Flexible message formatting options

Usage:
./matterbridge -conf config.toml

Key benefits:
- Unifies communication across disparate platforms
- Open-source and self-hostable
- Actively maintained with regular updates

Limitations:
- Some platforms require separate builds (e.g. WhatsApp multi-device)
- Setup can be complex for multiple bridges

Matterbridge can be build without gcc/c-compiler: If you're running on windows first run set CGO_ENABLED=0 on other platforms you prepend CGO_ENABLED=0 to the go build command. (eg CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/42wim/matterbridge)

To install the latest stable run:

go install github.com/42wim/matterbridge
To install the latest dev run:

go install github.com/42wim/matterbridge@master
To install the latest stable run without msteams or zulip bridge:

go install -tags nomsteams,nozulip github.com/42wim/matterbridge
You should now have matterbridge binary in the ~/go/bin directory:

$ ls ~/go/bin/
matterbridge
Building with whatsapp (beta) multidevice support
Because the library we use for Whatsapp multidevice support includes a GPL3 library we can not provide you binaries. (as this would require the Matterbridge to change it license to GPL)

Matterbridge can be build without gcc/c-compiler: If you're running on windows first run set CGO_ENABLED=0 on other platforms you prepend CGO_ENABLED=0 to the go build command. (eg CGO_ENABLED=0 go install github.com/42wim/matterbridge)

So this means you have to build it yourself using the instructions below:

go install -tags whatsappmulti github.com/42wim/matterbridge@master
If you're low on memory and don't need msteams:

go install -tags nomsteams,whatsappmulti github.com/42wim/matterbridge@master
You should now have matterbridge binary in the ~/go/bin directory:

$ ls ~/go/bin/
matterbridge
