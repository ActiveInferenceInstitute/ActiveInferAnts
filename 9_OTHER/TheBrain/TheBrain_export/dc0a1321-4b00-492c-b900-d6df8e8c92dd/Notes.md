Welcome to this Introduction to Getting Things Done (GTD) website, which is leveraging a dynamic knowledge platform, TheBrain.  The ultimate goal for this is two-fold.  For it to evolve into an Introduction to GTD (a companion to the 2015th edition) and of my own method.My own is most important.  Once we can get Catalytic Leaps established, we could have an employee working on The Companion if that remains a strategy (potential revenue stream).  Maybe some sort of partnership with Crucial Learning where we could offer discounts to people who go through their course(s)?

My vision for developing this is applying Engelbart’s bootstrapping strategy.  That is, we use GTD as an application development process!
