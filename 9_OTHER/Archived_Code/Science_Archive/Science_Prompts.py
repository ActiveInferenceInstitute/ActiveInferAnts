Follow these guidelines

1. Maintain the existing structure of functions (e.g., worldview, implications, stances, beliefs).

2. Add or modify dictionary keys and values to capture nuanced views and concepts.

3. Ensure that values (boolean, categorical, quantitative) accurately represent [ENTITY_NAME]'s stance on various topics.

4. Create new functions or classes if necessary to represent complex ideas or methodologies.

5. Use descriptive variable names that reflect [ENTITY_NAME]'s terminology, ontology, metaphysics.

6. Include comments to explain any non-obvious concepts or relationships.

7. If applicable, implement methods that simulate or represent [ENTITY_NAME]'s described processes or theories.

8. Ensure that the script follows Python best practices, it can be pseudocode or config-like at places.

9. Prioritize accuracy and fidelity to [ENTITY_NAME]'s ideas over brevity. Feel free to include long specific quotes in strings, for example exact key phrases, memes, explanations, predictions, based upon the transcripts in the folder

Use the existing ENTITY.py structure as a starting point, but feel free to expand or modify it as needed to best represent [ENTITY_NAME]'s comprehensive worldview and parameterized stances (there is no need to include technical/statistical methods for implementing Active Inference or Free Energy Principle here - focus only on the ENTITY's worldview beliefs)
