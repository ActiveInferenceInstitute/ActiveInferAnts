## Overview

Active InferAnts is a Python package designed to facilitate Active Inference in various applications, with a focus on ant colony optimization and related problems. It leverages advanced algorithms and data structures to provide efficient and accurate inference capabilities, combining the principles of active inference with the problem-solving strategies inspired by ant colonies.

## Features

- **Advanced Inference Algorithms**: Implementations of state-of-the-art active inference algorithms, including variational message passing and belief propagation.
- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Specialized algorithms for solving complex optimization problems using ant colony metaphors.
- **Modular Design**: Highly modular architecture allowing for easy integration and extension of new algorithms and problem domains.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation, including API references, tutorials, and examples to help users understand and utilize the package effectively.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for high performance and scalability, with support for parallel processing and GPU acceleration where applicable.
- **Visualization Tools**: Built-in tools for visualizing ant colony behavior, optimization processes, and inference results.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Flexible parameter settings to adapt algorithms to various problem domains and specific use cases.
