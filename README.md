# Active InferAnts

ActiveInferAnts is a cutting-edge computational framework designed for simulating ant colony behaviors and complex systems through the lens of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle.

Our mission with ActiveInferAnts is to offer a robust, scalable platform that enables the simulation and in-depth analysis of emergent phenomena within decentralized multi-agent systems, extending beyond ant colonies to encompass a wide range of complex systems.

## Key Features

- Grounded in Active Inference and Free Energy Principle.
- Features a modular and extensible architecture, complete with support for parallel computing and other features.
- Includes comprehensive multiscale ant agent models equipped with sensory inputs, motor functions, and mechanisms for learning and adaptation (at the nestmate & colony levels).
- Offers detailed modeling of niches and environments for realistic nested simulations.
- Enables analysis of emergent colony behaviors, including foraging, trail formation, and task allocation.
- Provides validation tools and utilities for empirical data, facilitating mapping simulations to real-world ant species and back.
