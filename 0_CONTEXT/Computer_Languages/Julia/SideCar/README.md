## Overview

SideCar integrates with MountainCarAI to provide:

1. Extended functionality for the Mountain Car problem
2. Additional experiments and analysis tools
3. Compatibility with RxInfer.jl for probabilistic inference

## Installation

1. Clone the SideCar repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SideCar.git
