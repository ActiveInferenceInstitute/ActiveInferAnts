Two Active Inference agents: A student agent and a teacher agent, like in a Waldorf school (teacher's job is to attend to student's curiosity).
The student is gravitating towards understanding Romantic Prussian poetry. 
The teacher is not a domain expert, they do have a gestalt understanding of the student's interests and can help them find resources.
For a loss function about what the teacher knows about the space (this is influenced and in feedback by the student's dynamics). 
Teacher is a passive agent, they don't take actions, they just observe and learn along with the student.

The question is
For the student's axiomatic system, how can we construct a generative model of the world that includes the topic and the teacher?
