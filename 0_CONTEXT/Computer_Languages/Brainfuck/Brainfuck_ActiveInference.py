Brainfuck code for active inference simulation.

This Brainfuck program simulates a sophisticated active inference process,
demonstrating the concept of minimizing expected free energy through an
intricate perception-action loop. The simulation incorporates multiple
cognitive processes, including attention, memory, anticipation, and learning.

Brainfuck commands:
>  - increment the data pointer
<  - decrement the data pointer
+  - increment the byte at the data pointer
-  - decrement the byte at the data pointer
.  - output the byte at the data pointer
,  - input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer
[  - jump forward to the command after the matching ] if the byte at the data pointer is zero
]  - jump back to the command after the matching [ if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero

Memory cell allocation:
0: Sensory input
1: Prediction
2: Action
3: Free energy
4: Attention
5: Memory
6: Anticipation
7: Learning rate
8: Precision
9: Temporal integration
10: Exploration factor
11: Model complexity
12: Goal-directed behavior
13: Uncertainty

The following Brainfuck code simulates an advanced active inference process:

This advanced active inference simulation in Brainfuck demonstrates a more
sophisticated cognitive process, including:
1. Dynamic attention modulation based on precision and uncertainty
2. Continuous learning with adaptive rates and model complexity
3. Memory integration, anticipation, and goal-directed behavior
4. Temporal integration of free energy with model complexity considerations
5. Exploration-exploitation balance in action generation
6. Uncertainty handling throughout the process

The program outputs the action, free energy, temporal integration, and
uncertainty at each step, allowing for comprehensive analysis of the
system's behavior over time.
