# P3IF System Overview

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The Pattern, Process, Perspective Integration Framework (P3IF) is a sophisticated system designed to integrate and visualize complex data relationships across multiple domains. This README provides a comprehensive guide for setting up the P3IF system, generating synthetic data, and visualizing the results.

## Features

- Integrates complex data relationships
- Generates synthetic data across multiple domains
- Visualizes data relationships and patterns
- Exports data in various formats (JSON, DB)

## Prerequisites

Before running the P3IF system, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/P3IF.git
   cd P3IF
   ```
## Usage

The P3IF system consists of three main scripts that should be run in sequence:

1. Set up the initial schema and database:
   ```
   python3 P3IF.py
   ```
   This script creates the initial schema and database (.db) which is then exported to a JSON file.

2. Generate synthetic data:
   ```
   python3 SyntheticData_P3IF.py
   ```
   This script synthesizes data from different DOMAINS using realistic and relevant Processes, Properties, and Perspectives. 

3. Visualize the data:
   ```
   python3 Visualize_P3IF.py
   ```
   This script visualizes the data from the synthetic data generation across DOMAINS, outputting visualization scripts into the `/P3IF/visualizations/` directory.

## File Descriptions

- `P3IF.py`: Sets up the initial schema and database
- `SyntheticData_P3IF.py`: Generates synthetic data across domains
- `Visualize_P3IF.py`: Creates visualizations of the generated data
