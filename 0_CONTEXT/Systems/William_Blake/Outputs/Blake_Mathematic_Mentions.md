In the night of prosperity and wantonness which he himself Created
Among the Daughters of Albion among the Rocks of the Druids
When Satan fainted beneath the arrows of Elynittria
And Mathematic Proportion was subdued by Living Proportion
[ PLATE6 ]
From Golgonooza the spiritual Four-fold London eternal
In immense labours & sorrows, ever building, ever falling,

But in the Nerves of the Nostrils, Accident being formed35
Into Substance & Principle, by the cruelties of Demonstration
It became Opake & Indefinite; but the Divine Saviour,
Formed it into a Solid by Los's Mathematic power.
He named the Opake Satan: he named the Solid Adam
And in the Nerves of the Ear, (for the Nerves of the Tongue are closed)40
On Albions Rock Los stands creating the glorious Sun each morning

While those combind by Satans Tyranny first in the blood of War
And Sacrifice &, next, in Chains of imprisonment: are Shapeless Rocks
Retaining only Satans Mathematic Holiness, Length: Bredth & Highth
Calling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision & Fruition
In which Man liveth eternally: madness & blasphemy, against20
Its own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords

What shall I do! or how exist, divided from Enitharmon?
Yet why despair! I saw the finger of God go forth10
Upon my Furnaces, from within the Wheels of Albions Sons:
Fixing their Systems, permanent: by mathematic power
Giving a body to Falshood that it may be cast off for ever.
With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his own bow!
God is within, & without! he is even in the depths of Hell!15

And while the Sons of Albion by severe War & Judgment, bonify10
The Hermaphroditic Condensations are divided by the Knife
The obdurate Forms are cut asunder by jealousy & Pity.
Rational Philosophy and Mathematic Demonstration
Is divided in the intoxications of pleasure & affection
Two Contraries War against each other in fury & blood,15
And Los fixes them on his Anvil, incessant his blows:

Rome & Greece swept Art into their maw & destroyd it a Warlike State never can produce Art. It will Rob & Plunder & accumulate into one place, & Translate & Copy & Buy & Sell & Criticise, but not Make.

Mathematic Form is Eternal in the Reasoning Memory. Living Form is Eternal Existence.

Grecian is Mathematic Form

And to his sons in their degrees & to his beauteous daughters
Travelling in silent majesty along their orderd ways
In right lined paths outmeasurd by proportions of number weight t
And measure. mathematic motion wondrous. along the deep
In fiery pyramid. or Cube. or unornamented pillar t25
Of fire far shining. travelling along even to its destind end
Then falling down. a terrible space recovring in winter dire

Sir said the Antiquarian I have seen these works & I do affirm that they are no such thing. they seem to me to be the most wretched paltry flimsy Stuff that ever—What d'ye say What dye say said Inflammable Gass, why why I wish I could see you write so. Sir said the Antiquarian, according to my opinion the author is an errant blockhead.—Your reason Your reason said Inflammable Gass—why why I think it very abominable to call a man a blockhead that you know nothing of.—Reason Sir said the Antiquarian I'll give you an example for your reason As I was walking along the street I saw a <vast> number of swallows on the [ top of an house ]rails of an old Gothic square they seemd to be going on their passage, as Pliny says as I was looking up, a little outré fellow pulling me by the sleeve cries pray Sir who do all they belong to. I turnd my self about with great [P 2] contempt. Said I, Go along you fool.—Fool said he who do you call fool I only askd you a civil question— [ here Etr ]I had a great mind to have thrashd the fellow only he was bigger than I—here Etruscan column left off—Inflammable Gass, recollecting himself Indeed I do not think the man was a fool for he seems to me to have been desirous of enquiring into the works of nature—Ha Ha Ha said the Pythagorean. it was reechod by [ the ]Inflammable Gass to overthrow the argument—Etruscan Column then star [t] ing up & clenching both his fists was prepared to give a formal answer to the company But Ob [t] use Angle, entering the room having made a gentle bow, proceeded to empty his pockets of a vast number of papers, turned about & sat down wiped his [ head ] <face>with his pocket handkerchief & shutting his eyes began to scratch his head—well gentlemen said he what is the cause of strife the Cynic answerd. they are only quarreling about Voltaire—Yes said the Epicurean & having a bit of fun with him. And said the Pythagorean endeavoring to incorporate their souls with their bodies

Obtuse Angle giving a grin said Voltaire understood nothing of the Mathematics and a man must be a fool ifaith not to understand the Mathematics

Inflammable Gass turning round hastily in his chair said Mathematics he found out a number of Queries in Philosophy. Obtuse Angle shutting his eyes & saying that he always understood better when he shut his eyes [ It is not of use to make ] <said>In the first place it is of no use for a man to make Queries but to solve them, for a man may be a fool & make Queries but a man must have good sound sense to solve them. a query & an answer are as different as a strait line & a crooked one. secondly I, I, I. aye Secondly, Voltaire's a fool, says the Epicurean—.Pooh says the Mathematician scratching his head with double violence, it is not worth Quarreling about.—The Antiquarian

here got up—& hemming twice to shew the strength of his Lungs, said but my Good Sir, Voltaire was immersed in matter, & seems to have understood very little but what he saw before his eyes, like the Animal upon the Pythagoreans lap always playing with its own tail. Ha Ha Ha said Inflammable Gass he was the Glory of France—I have got a bottle of air that would spread a Plague. here the Antiquarian shruggd up his shoulders & was silent [ talkd for half an hour ]while Inflammable Gass talkd for half an hour

Then Tilly Lally took up a Quadrant & askd. [ what is this gim crank for ]. Is not this a sun dial. Yes said Scopprell but its broke—at this moment the three Philosophers enterd and lowring darkness hoverd oer th assembly.

Come said the Epicurean lets have some rum & water & hang the mathematics come Aradobo say some thing then Aradobo began In the first place I think I think in the first place that Chatterton was clever at Fissic Follogy, Pistinology, Aridology, Arography, Transmography Phizography, Hogamy HAtomy, & hall that but <in the first place> he eat wery little wickly that is he slept very little which he brought into a consumsion, & what was that that he took [ Cha ]Fissic or somethink & so died

So all the people in the book enterd into the room & they could not talk any more to the present purpose

The Whole Bible is filld with Imaginations & Visions from End to End & not with Moral virtues that is the baseness of Plato & the Greeks & all Warriors The Moral Virtues are continual Accusers of Sin & promote Eternal Wars & Domineering over others

b12.10.8
[P 217]Aristotle maketh a threefold distinction of objects according to the three speculative sciences. Physics he supposeth to be conversant about such things as have a principle of motion in themselves, mathematics about things permanent but not abstracted, and theology about being abstracted and immoveable, which distinction may be seen in the ninth book of his metaphysics.
