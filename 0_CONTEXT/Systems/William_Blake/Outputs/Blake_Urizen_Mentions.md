[ PLATE5 ]
But when the morn arose, her lamentation renewd,
The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, & eccho back her sighs.
O Urizen! Creator of men! Mistaken Demon of heaven:
Thy joys are tears! thy labour vain, to form men to thine image.
How can one joy absorb another? are not different joys5
Holy, eternal, infinite! and each joy is a Love.

---
[ PLATE8 ]
The terror answerd: I am Orc, wreath'd round the accursed tree:
The times are ended; shadows pass the morning gins to break;
The fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands,
What night he led the starry hosts thro' the wide wilderness:
That stony law I stamp to dust: and scatter religion abroad5
To the four winds as a torn book, & none shall gather the leaves;

---
Over their pale limbs as a vine when the tender grape appears
[ PLATE16 ]
Over the hills, the vales, the cities, rage the red flames fierce;
The Heavens melted from north to south; and Urizen who sat
Above all heavens in thunders wrap'd, emerg'd his leprous head
From out his holy shrine, his tears in deluge piteous
Falling into the deep sublime! flag'd with grey-brow'd snows5

---
To the close hall of counsel, where his Angel form renews.
In a sweet vale shelter'd with cedars, that eternal stretch
Their unmov'd branches, stood the hall; built when the moon shot forth,
In that dread night when Urizen call'd the stars round his feet;5
Then burst the center from its orb, and found a place beneath;
And Earth conglob'd, in narrow room, roll'd round its sulphur Sun.
To this deep valley situated by the flowing Thames;

---
Thus speaking while his num'rous sons shook their bright fiery wings
Again the night is come t
That strong Urthona takes his rest,10
And Urizen unloos'd from chains
Glows like a meteor in the distant north
Stretch forth your hands and strike the elemental strings!
Awake the thunders of the deep.

---
62
[ PLATE4 ]
The shrill winds wake
Till all the sons of Urizen look out and envy Los:
Sieze all the spirits of life and bind
Their warbling joys to our loud strings
Bind all the nourishing sweets of earth5

---
A raging whirlpool draws the dizzy enquirer to his grave:
[ PLATE11 ]
Albions Angel rose upon the Stone of Night.
He saw Urizen on the Atlantic;
And his brazen Book,
That Kings & Priests had copied on Earth
Expanded from North to South.5

---
And the clouds & fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon
Round Albions cliffs & Londons walls; still Enitharmon slept!
Rolling volumes of grey mist involve Churches, Palaces, Towers:
For Urizen unclaspd his Book: feeding his soul with pity
The youth of England hid in gloom curse the paind heavens; compell'd5
Into the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel
Their parents brought them forth & aged ignorance preaches canting,

---
The citizens: in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs30
Walk heavy: soft and bent are the bones of villagers
65
Between the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy
Around the limbs of Albions Guardian, his flesh consuming.
Howlings & hissings, shrieks & groans, & voices of despair
Arise around him in the cloudy t35

---
Smile son of my afflictions.30
Arise O Orc and give our mountains joy of thy red light.
She ceas'd, for All were forth at sport beneath the solemn moon t
Waking the stars of Urizen with their immortal songs,
That nature felt thro' all her pores the enormous revelry,
Till morning ope'd the eastern gate. t35
Then every one fled to his station, & Enitharmon wept.

---
I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet:
He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.
In heart-formed Africa.
Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd!
And thus the Song began5
Adam stood in the garden of Eden:
And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;

---
And thus the Song began5
Adam stood in the garden of Eden:
And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;
They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations
By the hands of the children of Los.
Adam shudderd! Noah faded! black grew the sunny African10
When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East:

---
Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more
And more to Earth: closing and restraining:
Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete15
Urizen wept & gave it into the hands of Newton & Locke
Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau & Voltaire:
And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods
Of Asia; & on the desarts of Africa round the Fallen Angels

---
May be dull'd; and the nostrils clos'd up;
To teach mortal worms the path
That leads from the gates of the Grave.
Urizen heard them cry!
And his shudd'ring waving wings10
Went enormous above the red flames
Drawing clouds of despair thro' the heavens

---
Lay bleach'd on the garden of Eden;
And Noah as white as snow
On the mountains of Ararat.
Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud
From his woven darkness above.25
Orc raging in European darkness
Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps

Of the primeval Priests assum'd power,
When Eternals spurn'd back his religion;
And gave him a place in the north,

Self-closd, all-repelling: what Demon
Hath form'd this abominable void
This soul-shudd'ring vacuum?â€”Some said5
"It is Urizen", But unknown, abstracted
Brooding secret, the dark power hid.
2. Times on times he divided, & measur'd
Space by space in his ninefold darkness

Age on ages he lay, clos'd, unknown
Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid25
The petrific abominable chaos
6. His cold horrors silent, dark Urizen
Prepar'd: his ten thousands of thunders
Rang'd in gloom'd array stretch out across
The dread world, & the rolling of wheels30

Death was not, but eternal life sprung
2. The sound of a trumpet the heavens40
Awoke & vast clouds of blood roll'd
Round the dim rocks of Urizen, so nam'd
That solitary one in Immensity
3. Shrill the trumpet: & myriads of Eternity, t
[ PLATE4 ]

---
An ocean of voidness unfathomable.
4. The roaring fires ran o'er the heav'ns
In whirlwinds & cataracts of blood
And o'er the dark desarts of Urizen
Fires pour thro' the void on all sides15
On Urizens self-begotten armies. t

On the shore of the infinite ocean35

For Eternity stood wide apart,

9. Los wept howling around the dark Demon:
And cursing his lot; for in anguish,

Urizen was rent from his side;
And a fathomless void for his feet;5
And intense fires for his dwelling.

Cold, featureless, flesh or clay,5
Rifted with direful changes
He lay in a dreamless night

The dark changes & bound every change10
With rivets of iron & brass;

Beating still on his rivets of iron
Pouring sodor of iron; dividing
The horrible night into watches.10
2. And Urizen (so his eternal name)
His prolific delight obscurd more & more
In dark secresy hiding in surgeing
Sulphureous fluid his phantasies.

The bellows & hammer are silent now
A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice
Siez'd; a cold solitude & dark void
The Eternal Prophet & Urizen clos'd40
5. Ages on ages rolld over them
Cut off from life & light frozen
Into horrible forms of deformity

Struck horror into his soul.
6. Los wept obscur'd with mourning:
His bosom earthquak'd with sighs;
He saw Urizen deadly black,50
In his chains bound, & Pity began,

For pity divides the soul

Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided
Before the death-image of Urizen
For in changeable clouds and darkness
In a winterly night beneath,
The Abyss of Los stretch'd immense:5

They chain'd his young limbs to the rock
With the Chain of Jealousy
Beneath Urizens deathful shadow25

Mountain, moor, & wilderness,
With a globe of fire lighting his journey
A fearful journey, annoy'd

Of a foot, or a hand, or a head5
Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous
Dread terrors! delighting in blood
3. Most Urizen sicken'd to see
His eternal creations appear
Sons & daughters of sorrow on mountains10
Weeping! wailing! first Thiriel appear'd

Like a spiders web, moist, cold, & dim10
Drawing out from his sorrowing soul
The dungeon-like heaven dividing.
Where ever the footsteps of Urizen
Walk'd over the cities in sorrow.

As the thunder-stone is moulded.

Said Fuzon, this abstract non-entity
This cloudy God seated on waters

This cloudy God seated on waters
Now seen, now obscur'd; King of sorrow?
3: So he spoke, in a fiery flame,
On Urizen frowning indignant,15
The Globe of wrath shaking on high
Roaring with fury, he threw
The howling Globe: burning it flew

The howling Globe: burning it flew
Lengthning into a hungry beam. Swiftly
4: Oppos'd to the exulting flam'd beam20
The broad Disk of Urizen upheav'd
Across the Void many a mile.

Beats incessant; ten winters the disk

6: But the strong arm that sent it, remember'd
The sounding beam; laughing it tore through
That beaten mass: keeping its direction
The cold loins of Urizen dividing.

Ahania (so name his parted soul)

Then hid her in darkness in silence;
Jealous tho' she was invisible.

In chaos and circling dark Urizen,
As the moon anguishd circles the earth;40
Hopeless! abhorrd! a death-shadow,
Unseen, unbodied, unknown,

And his eyes pale with anguish, his lips
Blue & changing; in tears and bitter
Contrition he prepar'd his Bow,

Some in vales; some aloft flew in air

Scaled and poisonous horned
Approach'd Urizen even to his knees15
As he sat on his dark rooted Oak.

Great the conflict & great the jealousy

Then polish'd his ribs, and his sinews
Dried; laid them apart till winter;

Poisonous source! plac'd with art, lifting difficult
Its weighty bulk: silent the rock lay.35

Thought Urizen slain by his wrath.

From Eternals, he sat on a rock
Barren; a rock which himself
From redounding fancies had petrified

Till the horrid plant bending its boughs65
Grew to roots when it felt the earth
And again sprung to many a tree.

He beheld himself compassed round
And high roofed over with trees70
He arose but the stems stood so thick

With thy band full of generous fire30
Walked forth from the clouds of morning

With destruction & plagues. In the midst30

Which is the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus, blessed for ever.
Mark well my words. they are of your eternal salvation:5

Except remotely; and I heard Ololon say to Milton
I see thee strive upon the Brooks of Arnon. there a dread
And awful Man I see, oercoverd with the mantle of years.5
I behold Los & Urizen. I behold Orc & Tharmas;
The Four Zoa's of Albion & thy Spirit with them striving
In Self annihilation giving thy life to thy enemies
Are those who contemn Religion & seek to annihilate it

Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction and sealed,30
And Vala fed in cruel delight, the Furnaces with fire:
Stern Urizen beheld; urgd by necessity to keep
The evil day afar, and if perchance with iron power
He might avert his own despair: in woe & fear he saw
Vala incircle round the Furnaces where Luvah was clos'd:35

[ PLATE14 ]
One hair nor particle of dust, not one can pass away.
He views the Cherub at the Tree of Life, also the Serpent,
Orc the first born coild in the south: the Dragon Urizen:
Tharmas the Vegetated Tongue even the Devouring Tongue:
A threefold region, a false brain: a false heart:5
And false bowels: altogether composing the False Tongue,

Here Los fixd down the Fifty-two Counties of England & Wales
The Thirty-six of Scotland, & the Thirty-four of Ireland
With mighty power, when they fled out at Jerusalems Gates30
Away from the Conflict of Luvah & Urizen, fixing the Gates
In the Twelve Counties of Wales & thence Gates looking every way
To the Four Points: conduct to England & Scotland & Ireland
And thence to all the Kingdoms & Nations & Families of the Earth

---
They change their situations, in the Universal Man.
Albion groans, he sees the Elements divide before his face.
And England who is Brittannia divided into Jerusalem & Vala
And Urizen assumes the East, Luvah assumes the South
In his dark Spectre ravening from his open Sepulcher30
And the Four Zoa's who are the Four Eternal Senses of Man
Became Four Elements separating from the Limbs of Albion

[ PLATE38 [43] ]
They saw their Wheels rising up poisonous against Albion
Urizen, cold & scientific: Luvah, pitying & weeping
Tharmas, indolent & sullen: Urthona, doubting & despairing
Victims to one another & dreadfully plotting against each other
To prevent Albion walking about in the Four Complexions.5

---
Shall make him & his sons & daughters your slaves for ever!
And is this Faith? Behold the strife of Albion, & Luvah55
Is great in the east, their spears of blood rage in the eastern heaven
Urizen is the champion of Albion, they will slay my Luvah:
And thou O harlot daughter! daughter of despair art all
This cause of these shakings of my towers on Euphrates.
Here is the House of Albion, & here is thy secluded place60

To Create a World of Generation from the World of Death:
Dividing the Masculine & Feminine: for the comingling
Of Albions & Luvahs Spectres was Hermaphroditic20
Urizen wrathful strode above directing the awful Building:
As a Mighty Temple; delivering Form out of confusion
208
Jordan sprang beneath its threshold bubbling from beneath

---
France & Spain & Italy & Denmark & Holland & Germany
Are the temples among his pillars. Britain is Los's Forge;
America North & South are his baths of living waters.
Such is the Ancient World of Urizen in the Satanic Void
Created from the Valley of Middlesex by Londons River45
From Stone-henge and from London Stone, from Cornwall to Cathnes
The Four Zoa's rush around on all sides in dire ruin

---
The Habitation of the Spectres of the Dead & the Place
Of Redemption & of awaking again into Eternity
For Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic10
One to the North; Urthona: One to the South; Urizen:
One to the East: Luvah: One to the West, Tharmas;
They are the Four Zoas that stood around the Throne Divine
Verulam: London: York & Edinburgh: their English names

Jehovah stood among the Druids in the Valley of Annandale
When the Four Zoas of Albion, the Four Living Creatures, the Cherubim
Of Albion tremble before the Spectre, in the starry likeness of the Plow
Of Nations. And their Names are Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona
214
Luvah slew Tharmas the Angel of the Tongue & Albion brought him t5
To Justice in his own City of Paris, denying the Resurrection

---
They staind him with poisonous blue, they inwove him in cruel roots
To die a death of Six thousand years bound round with vegetation10
The sun was black & the moon rolld a useless globe thro Britain!
Then left the Sons of Urizen the plow & harrow, the loom
The hammer & the chisel, & the rule & compasses; from London fleeing
They forg'd the sword on Cheviot, the chariot of war & the battle-ax,
The trumpet fitted to mortal battle, & the flute of summer in Annandale15

---
Shake off the waters from thy wings! & the dust from thy white garments
Remember all thy feigned terrors on the secret couch of Lambeths Vale
When the sun rose in glowing morn, with arms of mighty hosts
Marching to battle who was wont to rise with Urizens harps
Girt as a sower with his seed to scatter life abroad over Albion:45
Arise O Vala! bring the bow of Urizen: bring the swift arrows of light.
How rag'd the golden horses of Urizen, compelld to the chariot of love!

In awful pomp & gold, in all the precious unhewn stones of Eden
They build a stupendous Building on the Plain of Salisbury; with chains
Of rocks round London Stone: of Reasonings: of unhewn Demonstrations
In labyrinthine arches. (Mighty Urizen the Architect.) thro which
The Heavens might revolve & Eternity be bound in their chain.5
Labour unparallelld! a wondrous rocky World of cruel destiny
Rocks piled on rocks reaching the stars: stretching from pole to pole.

From London to York & Edinburgh the Furnaces rage terrible
Primrose Hill is the mouth of the Furnace & the Iron Door;
[ PLATE74 ]
The Four Zoa's clouded rage; Urizen stood by Albion

Entering into the Reasoning Power, forsaking Imagination

Enitharmon who at her shining Looms sings lulling cadences45
While Los stood at his Anvil in wrath the victim of their love
And hate; dividing the Space of Love with brazen Compasses
In Golgonooza & in Udan-Adan & in Entuthon of Urizen.
The blow of his Hammer is Justice. the swing of his Hammer: Mercy.
The force of Los's Hammer is eternal Forgiveness; but50
His rage or his mildness were vain, she scatterd his love on the wind

---
He takes his Bow, then chooses out his arrows of flaming gold
Murmuring the Bowstring breathes with ardor! clouds roll around the
Horns of the wide Bow, loud sounding winds sport on the mountain brows15
Compelling Urizen to his Furrow; & Tharmas to his Sheepfold;
And Luvah to his Loom: Urthona he beheld mighty labouring at
His Anvil, in the Great Spectre Los unwearied labouring & weeping
Therefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas Spectre in songs

---
And all the Cities of Albion rose from their Slumbers, and All
The Sons & Daughters of Albion on soft clouds Waking from Sleep
Soon all around remote the Heavens burnt with flaming fires40
And Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona arose into
Albions Bosom: Then Albion stood before Jesus in the Clouds
Of Heaven Fourfold among the Visions of God in Eternity
[ PLATE97 ]

---
Appears upon our Hills: Awake Jerusalem, and come away
So spake the Vision of Albion & in him so spake in my hearing5
The Universal Father. Then Albion stretchd his hand into Infinitude.
And took his Bow. Fourfold the Vision for bright beaming Urizen
Layd his hand on the South & took a breathing Bow of carved Gold
Luvah his hand stretch'd to the East & bore a Silver Bow bright shining
Tharmas Westward a Bow of Brass pure flaming richly wrought10

---
We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres t
Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds
Hear! I will sing a Song of Death! it is a Song of Vala! t
The Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch t10
Luvah and Vala woke & flew up from the Human Heart t
Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber'd.
And Luvah siez'd the Horses of Light, & rose into the Chariot of Day

---
I see the shower of blood: I see the swords & spears of futurity
Tho in the Brain of Man we live, & in his circling Nerves.15
Tho' this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain.
Where Urizen & all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps
Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns
So spoke Los. Scorn & Indignation rose upon Enitharmon
Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands t20

A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits
Of Luvah & Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood! t

Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo! I am also such
One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine20
For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine

In Conways Vale thus recounting the Wars of Death Eternal t15

Night the [Second] t

Turning his Eyes outward to Self. losing the Divine Vision
Albion calld Urizen & said. Behold these sickning Spheres t

Mighty was the draught of Voidness to draw Existence in
Terrific Urizen strode above, in fear & pale dismay
He saw the indefinite space beneath & his soul shrunk with horror
His feet upon the verge of Non Existence; his voice went forth
Luvah & Vala trembling & shrinking, beheld the great Work master t5

And heard his Word! Divide ye bands influence by influence
Build we a Bower for heavens darling in the grizly deep
Build we the Mundane Shell around the Rock of Albion

To our Primeval Chaos in fortuitous concourse of incoherent
Discordant principles of Love & Hate I suffer affliction

Beneath the furnaces a woful heap in living death
Then were the furnaces unscald with spades & pickaxes
Roaring let out the fluid, the molten metal ran in channels
Cut by the plow of ages held in Urizens strong hand
In many a valley, for the Bulls of Luvah dragd the Plow10
With trembling horror pale aghast the Children of Man t
Stood on the infinite Earth & saw these visions in the air

Listen to her who loves thee lest we also are driven away.
They heard the Voice & fled swift as the winters setting sun t

And the vast form of Nature like a Serpent roll'd between. t
She ended. for his wrathful throne burst forth the black hail storm t
Am I not God said Urizen. Who is Equal to me
Do I not stretch the heavens abroad or fold them up like a garment20
He spoke mustering his heavy clouds around him black opake

And art thou also become like Vala thus I cast thee out.
So loud in thunders spoke the King folded in dark despair
And threw Ahania from his bosom obdurate She fell like lightning
Then fled the sons of Urizen from his thunderous throne petrific25
They fled to East & West & left the North & South of Heaven
A crash ran thro the immense The bounds of Destiny were broken
The bounds of Destiny crashd direful & the swelling Sea

Thro the Confusion like a crack across from immense to immense10
Loud strong a universal groan of death louder
Than all the wracking elements deafend & rended worse

But from the Dolorous Groan one like a shadow of smoke appeard
And human bones rattling together in the smoke & stamping15
The nether Abyss & gnasshing in fierce despair. panting in sobs

Struggling to utter the voice of Man struggling to take the features of Man. Struggling t
To take the limbs of Man at length emerging from the smoke

The dead reard up his Voice & stood on the resounding shore
Crying. Fury in my limbs. destruction in my bones & marrow

A Universe of Death & Decay. Let Enitharmons hands5

Hitherto shalt thou come. no further. here thy proud waves cease
We have drunk up the Eternal Man by our unbounded power t
Beware lest we also drink up thee rough demon of the waters
Our God is Urizen the King. King of the Heavenly hosts15
We have no other God but he thou father of worms & clay
And he is falln into the Deep rough Demon of the waters
And Los remains God over all, weak father of worms & clay

Against me who thee guarded in the night of death from harm
Tharmas replied. Art thou Urthona My friend my old companion,
With whom I livd in happiness before that deadly night
When Urizen gave the horses of Light into the hands of Luvah30
Thou knowest not what Tharmas knows. O I could tell thee tales
That would enrage thee as it has Enraged me even
From Death in wrath & fury. But now come bear back

Dark dreadful rose & Enitharmon lay at Los's feet
The dolorous shadow joyd. weak hope appeard around his head10
Tharmas before Los stood & thus the Voice of Tharmas rolld
Now all comes into the power of Tharmas. Urizen is falln
And Luvah hidden in the Elemental forms of Life & Death

At noon & laid her head upon my wearied bosom at night

And I what can I now behold but an Eternal Death
Before my Eyes & an Eternal weary work to strive

Night the Sixth
So Urizen arose & leaning on his Spear explord his dens
He threw his flight thro the dark air to where a river flowd

And taking off his silver helmet filled it & drank

But when Unsatiated his thirst he assayd to gather more
Lo three terrific women at the verge of the bright flood5
Who would not suffer him to approach. but drove him back with storms

And wherefore dost thou pour this water forth in sighs & care10
She answerd not but filld her urn & pourd it forth abroad

Thou terrible woman clad in blue, whose strong attractive power
Draws all into a fountain at the rock of thy attraction
With frowning brow thou sittest mistress of these mighty waters15

Shut up his powers in oblivion. then as the seed shoots forth
In pain & sorrow. So the slimy bed his limbs renewd30
At first an infant weakness. periods passd he gatherd strength

Endless had been his travel but the Divine hand him led t
For infinite the distance & obscurd by Combustions dire

Or sleep such sleep as spirits eternal wearied in his dark
Tearful & sorrowful state. then rise look out & ponder

The unpassd void upward was still his mighty wandring
The midst between an Equilibrium grey of air serene20
Where he might live in peace & where his life might meet repose
But Urizen said Can I not leave this world of Cumbrous wheels
Circle oer Circle nor on high attain a void
Where self sustaining I may view all things beneath my feet
Or sinking thro these Elemental wonders swift to fall25

At the turning wheels of heaven shrunk away inward withring away
Gaining a New Dominion over all his sons & Daughters

Till a white woof coverd his cold limbs from head to feet t
Hair white as snow coverd him in flaky locks terrific
Overspreading his limbs. in pride he wanderd weeping

Followd behind him as the Web of a Spider dusky & cold
Shivering across from Vortex to Vortex drawn out from his mantle of years
A living Mantle adjoind to his life & growing from his Soul

And uttering such woes such bursts such thunderings t
The eyelids expansive as morning & the Ears
As a golden ascent winding round to the heavens of heavens

Weak & Weaker their expansive orbs began shrinking
Pangs smote thro the brain & a universal shriek
Ran thro the Abysses rending the web torment on torment
Thus Urizen in sorrows wanderd many a dreary way
Warring with monsters of the Deeps in his most hideous pilgrimage10
Till his bright hair scatterd in snows his skin barkd oer with wrinkles
Four Caverns rooting downwards their foundations thrusting forth

The metal rock & stone in ever painful throes of vegetation
The Cave of Orc stood to the South a furnace of dire flames
Quenchless unceasing. In the west the Cave of Urizen15

Then follows the golden harrow in the midst of Mental fires
To ravishing melody of flutes & harps & softest voice

---
The seed is harrowd in while flames heat the black mould & cause
The human harvest to begin Towards the south first sprang20
The myriads & in silent fear they look out from their graves
Then Urizen sits down to rest & all his wearied Sons
Take their repose on beds they drink they sing they view the flames
Of Orc in joy they view the human harvest springing up
A time they give to sweet repose till all the harvest is ripe25

---
And Lo like the harvest Moon Ahania cast off her death clothes
She folded them up in care in silence & her brightning limbs
Bathd in the clear spring of the rock then from her darksom cave
Issud in majesty divine Urizen rose up from his couch
On wings of tenfold joy clapping his hands his feet his radiant wings30
In the immense as when the Sun dances upon the mountains
A shout of jubilee in lovely notes responding from daughter to daughter

---
From son to Son as if the Stars beaming innumerable
395
Thro night should sing soft warbling filling Earth & heaven
And bright Ahania took her seat by Urizen in songs & joy35
The Eternal Man also sat down upon the Couches of Beulah
Sorrowful that he could not put off his new risen body
In mental flames the flames refusd they drove him back to Beulah

---
Expending all his energy against the fuel of fire
The Regenerate Man stoopd his head over the Universe & in t
His holy hands recievd the flaming Demon & Demoness of Smoke
And gave them to Urizens hands the Immortal frownd Saying5
Luvah & Vala henceforth you are Servants obey & live
You shall forget your former state return O Love in peace t
Into your place the place of seed not in the brain or heart

---
Cooperating in the bliss of Man obeying his Will
Servants to the infinite & Eternal of the Human form
Luvah & Vala descended & enterd the Gates of Dark Urthona
And walkd from the hands of Urizen in the shadows of Valas Garden
Where the impressions of Despair & Hope for ever vegetate20
In flowers in fruits in fishes birds & beasts & clouds & waters
The land of doubts & shadows sweet delusions unformd hopes

---
Muttering along from heaven to heaven hoarse roll the human forms
Beneath thick clouds dreadful lightnings burst & thunders roll
Down pour the torrent Floods of heaven on all the human harvest
Then Urizen sitting at his repose on beds in the bright South30
Cried Times are Ended he Exulted he arose in joy he exulted
He pourd his light & all his Sons & daughters pourd their light
To exhale the spirits of Luvah & Vala thro the atmosphere

---
In pain the human harvest wavd in horrible groans of woe40
[ page132 ]
The Universal Groan went up the Eternal Man was Darkend
Then Urizen arose & took his Sickle in his hand
There is a brazen sickle & a scythe of iron hid
Deep in the South guarded by a few solitary stars
This sickle Urizen took the scythe his sons embracd5

---
Then Urizen arose & took his Sickle in his hand
There is a brazen sickle & a scythe of iron hid
Deep in the South guarded by a few solitary stars
This sickle Urizen took the scythe his sons embracd5
And went forth & began to reap & all his joyful sons
Reapd the wide Universe & bound in Sheaves a wondrous harvest
They took them into the wide barns with loud rejoicings & triumph

---
When Morning dawnd The Eternals rose to labour at the Vintage
Beneath they saw their sons & daughters wondering inconcievable
At the dark myriads in Shadows in the worlds beneath
The morning dawnd Urizen rose & in his hand the Flail
Sounds on the Floor heard terrible by all beneath the heavens35
Dismal loud redounding the nether floor shakes with the sound
[ page134 ]

---
The good of all the Land is before you for Mystery is no more
Then All the Slaves from every Earth in the wide Universe30
Sing a New Song drowning confusion in its happy notes
While the flail of Urizen sounded loud & the winnowing wind of Tharmas
So loud so clear in the wide heavens & the song that they sung was this
Composed by an African Black from the little Earth of Sotha
Aha Aha how came I here so soon in my sweet native land t35

---
And Lo my Brethren in their tents & their little ones around them
The song arose to the Golden feast the Eternal Man rejoicd
Then the Eternal Man said Luvah the Vintage is ripe arise5
The sons of Urizen shall gather the vintage with sharp hooks
And all thy sons O Luvah bear away the families of Earth
I hear the flail of Urizen his barns are full no roo
Remains & in the Vineyards stand the abounding sheaves beneath

---

I hear the flail of Urizen his barns are full no roo
Remains & in the Vineyards stand the abounding sheaves beneath
The falling Grapes that odorous burst upon the winds. Arise10
My flocks & herds trample the Corn my cattle browze upon

---
Singing & shouting to the Man they bow their hoary heads
And murmuring in their channels flow & circle round his feet
[ page138 ]
Then Dark Urthona took the Corn out of the Stores of Urizen
He ground it in his rumbling Mills Terrible the distress
Of all the Nations of Earth ground in the Mills of Urthona
In his hand Tharmas takes the Storms. he turns the whirlwind Loose
