"Systems Within Systems" â€“ William Blake, FOIA, Cognitive Sovereignty, and PyMDP social learning

I. Opening 
   A. Make initial Github push.  
   B, Purpose of the stream: Explore various views on, implementations of, and interactions with, Systems.  

II. Systems
    A. William Blake's Structure and Content
       1. Introduction via Blake's mentions of Systems 
       2. Relevance to modern systems design
       3. Applications in our codebase

    B. Social Science setting for PyMDP active inference agents. 
       1. Quick review of the current implementation (initally at github.com/apashea/IC2S2-Active-Inference-Tutorial/)
       2. pymdp_pull.py and studying the PyMDP library
    
    C. Cognitive Sovereignty
       1.Cognitive Sovereignty & Active Inference in the State of Exception https://zenodo.org/records/10038232
       2. Implementation in systems design
       3. Possibly return to this and add in PyMDP structures
