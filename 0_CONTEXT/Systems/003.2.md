# Development Plan for ActInf/Cursor AI Integration

## 1. Initial Setup and Repository Preparation
1.1. Create a new GitHub repository named "ActInf-Cursor-Integration"
1.2. Set up the basic repository structure:
   - /scripts
   - /simulations
   - /docs
   - /tests
   - README.md

## 2. Build Working Scripts
2.1. Develop a basic pymdp script for social science simulation
   - Create /scripts/social_science_sim.py
   - Implement a simple agent-based model using pymdp
   - Add comprehensive comments and docstrings
2.2. Create a utility script for common functions
   - Create /scripts/utils.py
   - Implement reusable functions for data processing, visualization, etc.
2.3. Add scripts to the repository
   - Commit and push the new scripts to GitHub

## 3. Cursor AI Integration
3.1. Use Cursor to analyze the existing scripts
   - Open the repository in Cursor
   - Request Cursor to provide an overview of the scripts
3.2. Generate a new simulation script with Cursor's assistance
   - Ask Cursor to create a new script based on the existing ones
   - Manually refine and complete parts beyond Cursor's capabilities
3.3. Implement the new simulation
   - Create /simulations/cursor_generated_sim.py
   - Integrate Cursor's suggestions with manual additions
   - Test and debug the new simulation

## 4. Documentation and Testing
4.1. Write documentation for all scripts
   - Create /docs/script_overview.md
   - Document each script's purpose, inputs, outputs, and usage
4.2. Implement unit tests
   - Create /tests/test_social_science_sim.py
   - Create /tests/test_utils.py
   - Create /tests/test_cursor_generated_sim.py

## 5. Iteration and Improvement
5.1. Analyze Cursor's performance
   - Document areas where Cursor excelled or struggled
   - Create /docs/cursor_performance_analysis.md
5.2. Enhance repository for better Cursor integration
   - Refine code comments and docstrings for improved Cursor comprehension
   - Create /docs/cursor_integration_guide.md with best practices

## 6. Next Steps
6.1. Plan the next simulation to implement
   - Consider more complex social scenarios or multi-agent systems
   - Explore integration with other AI tools or frameworks
6.2. Update README.md with project progress and future directions
6.3. Create GitHub issues for identified improvements and next tasks
   - Prioritize tasks based on their impact on the project's goals

## 7. Continuous Integration and Deployment
7.1. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Configure workflows for running tests on push and pull requests
7.2. Implement a code review process for all new additions
   - Establish guidelines for code reviews
   - Set up pull request templates
7.3. Consider implementing continuous deployment for documentation updates

## 8. Advanced Features and Optimizations
8.1. Implement more sophisticated agent behaviors in social_science_sim.py
8.2. Optimize performance of simulation runs for larger scale experiments
8.3. Develop visualization tools for complex simulation results

## 9. Community Engagement
9.1. Create contribution guidelines for potential collaborators
9.2. Set up a project wiki for detailed documentation and tutorials
9.3. Consider presenting the project at relevant conferences or meetups

Execute this plan sequentially, adjusting as needed based on discoveries and challenges encountered during the process. Regularly review and update the plan to ensure it aligns with the project's evolving goals and the capabilities of the tools being used.
