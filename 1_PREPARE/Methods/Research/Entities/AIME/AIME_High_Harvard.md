CHRISTOPHER A. BARTLETT
AIME High: A Social Entrepreneur’s Moon Shot
In September 2016, Jack Manning Bancroft (or JMB as he was often called) was in Toronto when he
powered up his computer to connect with his board in Australia. The purpose of the meeting was to
discuss some radical changes he had proposed to the objectives, priorities and even the core mission of
the nonprofit he had founded a decade earlier. It was going to be an interesting discussion.
In 2005, JMB had created the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience (AIME) by linking 25
fellow University of Sydney students as mentors for 25 Aboriginal children in a nearby high school. By
2016, AIME had become a very successful national nonprofit organization with programs linking 6686
mentees in 340 high schools with 2255 mentors in 18 universities. Even more notable was the fact that
AIME mentees were now graduating high school at the same rate as non-Indigenous kids.
But now, with its vision of mentoring 10,000 kids by 2018 clearly in sight, the founder wanted to
refocus that objective. He proposed that the new goal should be to end educational inequality for all
160,000 Indigenous students in the school system by 2025. Even more challenging was his proposal to
change AIME’s core purpose. He wanted to expand its mission from ending educational inequality for
Australian Indigenous kids to a commitment to use its mentoring expertise to overcome educational
inequity wherever it occurred worldwide.
JMB recognized that there would be skeptics who felt that his radical new vision and mission
represented over-reach. He expected many to counsel him to focus instead on refining and growing
AIME’s successful Australian operations. But he felt he had to follow the advice he had long given his
mentees: “Shoot for the moon! If you miss, you’ll still end up among the stars.”
Origins of Australia’s Indigenous Educational Crisis
In 1788, the First Fleet landed in the bay to establish Australia as a penal colony of Britain. While
the Indigenous inhabitants defended themselves forcefully when attacked, they typically treated the
new arrivals with curiosity more than aggression. Nonetheless, over the next 130 years, local
populations were decimated through hostilities and disease, and Aboriginal culture was all but
destroyed. By the early 21st century, a growing recognition of this terrible history was finally leading
to public and private efforts directed towards reconciliation and restoration.

The Indigenous Context: Enduring Impact of European Contact
Archaeologists trace the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (henceforth referred
to as Aboriginal people or Indigenous Australians) to the arrival of their ancestors 50–60,000 years ago,
making them members of the world’s oldest continuous culture, one that was often surprisingly
complex. Following a nomadic way of life—a practice that sustained animal and plant life in a fragile
environment—these original inhabitants occupied the entire continent. By the 18th century, some 500
clans or nations existed, each with a strong attachment to its “country,” stories and traditions.
When the First Fleet arrived, Australia’s Aboriginal population was estimated to be about 750,000.
However, diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis as well as conflicts and the seizure of land and
water resources led to a decline in the Indigenous population to about 60,000 in the 1920s. At this point,
state and federal governments decided they had to adopt “protection measures” many of which
focused on moving survivors onto reserves or into missions.
Other initiatives involved “absorbing” or “assimilating” the children—especially those who were
not full-blooded Aboriginal kids—into society. Government agents and church officials began
removing many of these children from their Aboriginal families, placing them in institutions, missions,
or with non-Indigenous families. A 1997 Human Rights Commission report estimated that between
10% and 33% of all Indigenous children were removed from their families over a 70-year period. This
group, numbering 25,000 or more, became known as the “Stolen Generations.”
The Indigenous Education Gap Entering the 21st-Century
Following a 1967 Constitutional referendum that Indigenous people should finally be included in
the national census and granted full citizenship, multiple legal battles slowly achieved basic rights such
as equal pay, self-management, land rights and native title. But the results of decades of exploitation,
abuse and mistreatment were already clear in the health and education of the Indigenous survivors.
One of the greatest disadvantages was evident in education. In 2003, only 36% of Indigenous
students completed year 12 at high school compared with 75% for the population as a whole. (Exhibit
1.) And while 48% of all Australians had vocational qualifications or higher education degrees, just
22% of Indigenous adults held such credentials. It was this sizable education gap that became the focus
of Jack Manning Bancroft, a 17-year-old Indigenous student entering Sydney University in 2003.
Jack Manning Bancroft: Birth of a Social Entrepreneur
The son of an Aboriginal mother and a father who was a fifth generation Australian of Scots
heritage, Manning Bancroft grew up as a kid whose pale skin and blonde hair masked his strong
identification as being Aboriginal. As one of the first on his mother’s side of the family to reach
University, JMB knew he wanted to ensure that other Indigenous children had that same opportunity.
Growing up: Straddling Black and White Worlds
After his parents divorced, JMB’s Indigenous identity was shaped by an influential time when his
mother took him to her family home in the remote community of Lionsville. For the next year, as he
attended school with his mostly Aboriginal classmates, his mother’s relatives and community Elders
taught the 10-year-old about his family’s history and the values of an Indigenous community.
On returning to Sydney, Manning Bancroft entered a very different world. A gifted athlete, he was
admitted to Sydney Boys High School, an academically selective public school where all students wore

a blazer and tie. Four years later, with a resume reflecting his strong high school sports history and a
good academic record, he applied for a scholarship that sponsored an Indigenous applicant through
the University of Sydney. When the evaluators asked him why he should get the scholarship, JMB told
them, “If you give it to me, I’ll put something back. And if I do anything with my life, I’m going to do
something big.” He won the scholarship.
In February 2003, Manning Bancroft entered St. Paul’s College, the oldest, most traditional
residential college in this prestigious Australian university. Reflecting English college traditions,
students were required to wear ties, blazers and academic gowns to dinner every night in the formal
dining hall. In this privileged environment in the company of fellow students who mostly had
graduated from elite private schools, JMB felt uncomfortable, particularly around issues of identity.
With his fair skin, he worried that people would think he was not an appropriate Aboriginal
scholarship recipient.
A breakthrough occurred when he was invited to participate in the Indigenous University Student
Games. His media studies course had sensitized him to the fact that press reports about Aboriginal
people focused largely on “Indigenous problems,” and yet here were 200 or so talented University
student competitors who represented the kind of success he felt Indigenous children could aspire to. It
was the beginning of a connection that would lead him to his breakthrough concept.
Creating the Idea, Assembling the Team, Shaping the Model
Manning Bancroft also began spending time at the Koori Center, a gathering place for Indigenous
students at the University of Sydney. It was here that he began articulating an idea about a mentoring
program to connect Indigenous high school kids with university students, and over the next few
months, assembled a small group to design a pilot agenda.
The team decided the proposed program should prioritize enhancing kids’ self-confidence, pride,
and capacity to navigate the world they were in. They also agreed on the need to measure results, to
offer excellent mentor training, to define clear program rules, and to ensure child protection policies,
and recruited Baker and McKenzie, a leading law firm, to work on these issues pro bono. The ideas
were all converted into a 14-page business case, and by mid-2005, they were ready to implement.
The Founding Years: Concept to Confirmation to Crisis
The plan called for initial ideas to be tested in a pilot program for Year 9 students at Alexandria
Park Community School, a nearby public school where 90% of the class were Indigenous. At the initial
meeting to discuss the proposal, the school signed up: the start date would be August, and sessions
would be scheduled on Fridays, the day of the week when school attendance typically dropped.
2005: Launching the Pilot
Hoping to recruit 25 mentors for the target 25 mentees, JMB was amazed when 53 applicants
showed up for an all-day session on mentoring concepts, behavioral norm expectations and cross-
cultural issues. The training also allowed the team to assess prospective mentors and select the most
capable. “I wanted to make it competitive,” he said. “To see this as a chance to lead.”
The program began with six weekly workshops on a variety of topics—from creative writing to hip-
hop; from art to professional football—each led by a prominent Indigenous leader in the field who
modeled Aboriginal success. Following the workshops, six weeks of one-on-one mentoring sessions

AIME High: A Social Entrepreneur’s Moon Shot
covered themes ranging from broad issues like developing self-respect to specific skills such as goal
setting, with each session structured to ensure maximum outcomes. (Exhibit 2.)
While some sessions worked better than others, and some mentors created stronger links than
others, post-program student feedback was very positive. When teachers noted that attendance was
higher on AIME days, Manning Bancroft wrote, “We all knew we’d stumbled across something
special.”
2006: Refining the Model
By early 2006, JMB had decided not only to continue the pilot, but to expand it. Responding to
student feedback, he extended the program from 12 to 18 weeks, alternated mentor/mentee sessions
with workshops, and added new topics such as one dealing with racism. Other changes focused on
process: the value of humor, the need for clear boundaries, and the importance of creating a safe space.
Furthermore, Manning Bancroft proposed adding a Year 10 program at Alexandra Park and committed
to expanding the successful Year 9 program into a second school.
In its 2006 Annual Report, AIME related that 47 mentors and mentees had linked up, with positive
outcomes measured by attendance records, behavioral reports, academic results, and focus group
feedback. In one striking metric, Alexandria Park High School saw a 40% attendance increase by year
9 students, and a 15% increase by year 10 students. (Exhibit 3.)
2007: Breaking Out or Flaming Out?
At the end of 2006, Manning Bancroft had a major decision to make. If the organization was to keep
expanding after he graduated in December, it would need his full-time commitment. This would
require AIME to evolve from its current dependence on “in-kind” donations—a model it described as
“give what you’ve got”—and seek significant financial support. Early appeals led to a $20,000 grant
from Sydney University’s Faculty of Economics and Business and $10,000 from the Aboriginal
Education Council. Added to funds from its Indigenous Carnivale fundraiser, AIME had $40,000
entering 2007. But while this amount would cover program expenses like venue rental, transportation,
catering and guest expenses, it would not provide a salary for JMB.
Believing that AIME’s program generated huge benefits for the University—from providing its
students a valuable development experience to creating a pipeline of potential Indigenous students—
the young social entrepreneur took a $60,000 funding proposal to the University’s Indigenous Advisory
Board. It was rejected. So he adjusted the pitch to have funding included in the budgets of faculty
departments and residential colleges. Again, it was overruled. JMB then decided to finance AIME
internally by growing the Indigenous Carnivale into a Woodstock-scale musical event, taking this
innovative idea to a leading music promoter. Once again, he was knocked back. Finally, in April, he
learned that an application for Federal Government funding had been approved, providing $90,000
over two years—enough to support his salary. But when Manning Bancroft read the fine print, the
agreement demanded permanent, irrevocable world licensing rights for all project material. Unwilling
to give away AIME’s hard-earned intellectual capital, he rejected the grant.
By midyear, on the eve of the Indigenous Carnivale, JMB was exhausted. After a day of frustration
trying to drum up support for the fundraiser, he sent his supporters a message of distress: “I’ve been
stressing all day and started to become really scared—scared because of how apathetic everybody is.
The last three weeks have been the hardest of my life, but I kept myself going by saying that it’s worth
it . . . But if you want this to be a success, over the next four days you need to shoulder some
responsibility . . . Otherwise, I’m done . . .” The response was immediate and strong, and the Carnivale

went ahead. But it had all been so hard that JMB wondered if this was the beginning of the end of
AIME.
Weeks later, his sense of despair receded when he heard that Marie Bashir had been chosen as the
University’s Chancellor. Bashir who was also the State’s Governor (a ceremonial role as the Queen’s
representative) had long been supporter of JMB’s mother, a highly regarded Aboriginal artist. Having
known him since he was a baby, she was delighted to meet with the young student. To his delight,
Chancellor Bashir instantly saw the value of the program and soon organized a two-year grant. It was
a precedent that became a funding model for all of AIME’s future University partners.
Before receiving these funds, JMB had been working without a salary, supporting himself as an
after-school child caregiver and as a part-time cricket coach. But with a 2007 plan to expand to 100
mentors and mentees at five partner schools, AIME’s size and complexity required him to shift roles.
He now had to step back from his lead mentor role and teach others how to deliver the agenda.
AIME’s 2007 Annual Report stated that in addition to meeting its ambitious growth goals, the
organization had introduced a tutoring program for Year 11 and 12 students and had launched its first
after-school homework center. School attendance had increased 33% for students in the Year 9
program, and 37% for those in Year 10. In post-program feedback, 100% of mentees confirmed that
AIME was better preparing them for life after school.
Transition Time: Foundations of a Professional Organization
To implement its 2008 plans to recruit 400 mentees and link them with 400 mentors at four
university sites, AIME needed to develop its organization. It was time to become a formal nonprofit
entity and employ a full-time staff. “Bring on the future” said the annual report. “AIME is here to
stay.”
2008: Ensuring Governance, Recruiting Talent, Pursuing Funding
With the help of its pro bono law firm, in 2008 AIME was registered as a legal nonprofit
organization. As its CEO, the 22-year-old Manning Bancroft opened his first board meeting by thanking
his six well-connected board members and describing how he envisioned their role: “Your job is to help
guide the organization, ensure our finances, provide governance and support me with advice, contacts
and fundraising. But I don’t want you messing with the program. Let me run the show.”
To “run the show” Manning Bancroft needed staff, and despite limited funding, he began building
his team. His first recruit was Paul Sinclair, a fellow Indigenous student who had created the popular
and culturally rich “Animals of the Dreaming” AIME session at Taronga Zoo. JMB convinced his friend
to become AIME’s full-time Education Director. Sinclair drew on his teaching background to develop
lesson plans, workbooks, and teaching frameworks to reflect the approach he and Manning Bancroft
had brought to sessions in a style they described as “learning while laughing.”
As AIME expanded into new locations, two other Indigenous men were hired as program
managers. Next, JMB convinced his long-time volunteer office manager to quit her secure job and join
full-time. He then persuaded an old University friend volunteering as AIME’s bookkeeper to leave a
good bank job and become Finance Director. And finally, as his own financial support expired in mid-
2008, Manning Bancroft joined the payroll as AIME’s lowest paid staff member.
In 2008, in the spirit of “give what you’ve got” funding—AIME’s method of financing everything
from textbook printing to airline fares in this time—the University of Sydney Union offered them a

AIME High: A Social Entrepreneur’s Moon Shot
windowless a basement room on a five-year $5 per annum lease. On a table and eight chairs (a $45 eBay
purchase), program staff organized courses while the others began writing grant applications.
Meanwhile, JMB was visiting corporations and charitable foundations to present AIME’s business
case—the benefits of staff engagement, the value of connecting with passionate university students as
potential recruits and customers. Only later would he address closing the Indigenous education gap.
To create a strong partnership, he always tried to connect with the CEO rather than the Corporate
Social Responsibility Officer, and to engage the whole staff rather than just a select few.
He took the same approach to universities “We presented ourselves as a fee-based contract
provider not a charity,” he said. “We promised to enrich campus life, to offer their students
development opportunities, to get their brand out to local high schools, and to make them more
attractive to their alumni. Eventually, we’d discuss how helping disadvantaged kids through high
school and closing the Indigenous education gap could support their social responsibility
commitments.”
AIME’s 2008 year-end report was a mix of achievement and frustration. The organization reported
significant growth: 300 mentors from two university partners had supported 300 mentees in 18 partner
schools. Yet despite the impressive results, Manning Bancroft was disappointed: AIME had missed its
target of engaging 400 mentors from four university sites.
2009: Winning Support, Shaping Strategy
Nonetheless, those shortfalls were soon offset by good news. In early 2009, AIME was selected to
join a small group of nonprofits sustained by Social Ventures Australia (SVA), an organization
committed to identifying and nurturing outstanding social purpose organizations with proven impact.
From 80 candidates, AIME was one of two admitted to the SVA partnership in 2009, gaining access to
$100,000 of initial funding, and up to $1 million during a subsequent five-year relationship. In return,
AIME was required to work with SVA consultants to build its strategic capacity, measure its impact,
and develop its leadership team. If, after two years, AIME was achieving results, and if SVA also felt it
was adding value, the partnership would be renewed for up to three more years.
With SVA guidance and support, AIME created a bold vision and the strategic plan to achieve it.
Its five-year goals were to engage 3,600 Indigenous high school students at universities in every state,
to increase AIME students’ Year 12 completion rates to 75% against a national Indigenous norm of 39%,
and to achieve 30% university admission rates for its graduates compared to a national Indigenous rate
of 1.25%. “I had no idea how we’d get there by 2014,” said Manning Bancroft. “But we tested the goals
with our board, our staff, and the SVA team, and they were all willing to back us.”
Meanwhile, SVA was organizing a big event to present its eight “venture partners,” and particularly
its two newest, to the corporate and philanthropic partners who were the source of SVA’s financial and
service support. As SVA consultants helped the nonprofit CEOs compose their presentations, JMB
realized that the proposed speech format—an individual success story, followed by the program plan,
and a funding pitch to close—was too limiting. “I wanted to hook them with energy, tell the AIME
story, and leave them with a feeling,” he said. “I couldn’t do that by following a formula.” At the lunch,
he discarded his practiced speech, and just spoke from his heart. As he sat down to the loudest applause
of the lunch, he hoped he hadn’t upset the SVA coach.
Despite SVA funding being on hold until 2010, JMB lost no time in embracing its network. In one
key relationship, a couple with expertise in human resource practices advised that parting with
unhappy or floundering employees was invariably best for both parties. The advice led him to consider
6

919-411
parting with some struggling program managers, including the one who had succeeded him at Sydney
University. It happened to be his sister. “Firing Ella was really hard,” he recalled. “In startup mode,
you hire people you can trust. For me that was friends and family. But I failed Ella by not laying out
clear expectations. The lesson I learned was to be honest, be upfront, and set clear expectations.”
Meanwhile, to achieve the five-year goals of a tenfold increase in mentees and a national presence,
Manning Bancroft had instructed his team to contact universities nationwide and invite them to
AIME’s national launch in August. Yet despite the slated presence of many prominent Australians at
the event, by launch date, none of the 45 universities contacted or even the 15 personally visited had
accepted the invitation. At the last moment, JMB had to convert the big event into a simple
announcement of the organization’s intention to expand nationally.
When still no University had signed up by November, the CEO embarked on a roadshow that led
to 18 successive rejections. The final stop was Melbourne where he met with Monash University and
RMIT, a leading school of technology. “At this stage, I was totally broken,” JMB acknowledged. “If I
was knocked back here, I felt I wouldn’t be able to go on.” While recognizing that neither institution
represented an ideal mentoring site due to a lack of high schools with significant Indigenous student
numbers within a half hour’s drive, Manning Bancroft saw them as the last chance to achieve national
expansion—a vital step towards securing support from major Australian corporations. To his
unanticipated delight, both agreed to partner with AIME.
Weeks later, another satisfying surprise materialized. In December, as AIME resigned itself to
ending 2009 with an $80,000 deficit, Manning Bancroft received an unexpected email from Google
awarding the organization a $100,000 grant to support its work. Several weeks earlier, he had made a
pitch to Google’s local management seeking support. They explained that while they didn’t provide
funding, they could offer in-kind technology support. But Google’s Australian staff also quietly applied
for—and won—one of Google’s 25 worldwide year-end awards, thereby erasing AIME’s deficit.
Growing Up: External Gains, Internal Strains
In terms of reach, 2009 had been yet another year of rapid growth. AIME now served four university
partners and 33 partner schools. Moreover, 71% of its 325 mentees had completed Year 12 at high
school, and 38% had gone on to university. Its mentees were also assuming leadership positions with
two AIME mentee girls becoming the first ever Aboriginal school captains in their schools’ history. The
only question seemed to be whether such impressive growth was sustainable.
2010 to 2012: Heading for Breakout or Breakdown?
With such impressive results, AIME became the subject of many glowing news stories. In 2010,
Manning Bancroft was named Young Australian of the Year in New South Wales, a major honor in
Australia. Two years later, the young organization and its leader were the focus of the high-profile
national TV program, The Australian Story. 1 But AIME’s strong results and growing recognition
masked some internal problems that were straining the organization.
When Paul Sinclair moved from being a star program presenter to Education Director, he had
created lesson plans and teaching frameworks to guide program managers in their presentations. But
as JMB sat in on the revised sessions, he felt AIME’s imaginative forces had been limited. While the
planning, preparation and delivery focused on refining teaching skills, he felt they underutilized

AIME High: A Social Entrepreneur’s Moon Shot
AIME’s core power—one-on-one mentoring. So he and Sinclair went back to the drawing board to
revise the program design. The result was a set of textbooks, increased use of multimedia, and session
outlines designed to “bottle the magic that Paul and I had captured and present it in a format that
allowed others to engage kids and mentors like we did.” Employing these tools, programs regained
vitality.
By 2010 however, Manning Bancroft had a sense that Sinclair was beginning to fade and, in early
2011, wasn’t entirely surprised when his old friend told him that the job was too hard on his family
and that he was planning to leave. To JMB, this represented more than just the departure of AIME’s
first employee. He felt he was losing his mentor and idol, someone whose lightness and humor had
offset his own focus and intensity. For six years they had been close friends, synergetic co-presenters,
and joint developers who shared a single voice in program design. It was a major blow.
In some ways, Sinclair’s departure was symptomatic of a broader sense of organizational malaise
that JMB sensed in 2011. There was a growing feeling that AIME had changed from an intimate family
to a professional organization built on formal roles and relationships; that improvised experiments had
been tamed by strategic plans; and that its founder could no longer connect passionately and personally
with the 800 mentors and 800 mentees on the front lines.
Years later, Manning Bancroft recalled, “I was drowning. Everybody seemed to want a slice of my
time . . . I’d get angry and frustrated at those who were firing new ideas at me, or worse, just doing
their own thing.” The pressure was also affecting him personally. “I was traumatized because I felt
people had let me down,” he said. “The reality was different. I wasn’t a good enough leader. I didn’t
know how to coach people, to ask questions I didn’t want to hear answers to . . . I wanted to be liked
too badly. I felt AIME owned me, that I’d never escape and that I’d lost my youth.”
Unable to share his growing feeling of self-doubt with friends, many of whom now worked at
AIME, JMB turned to family for support. His mother recalled telling him, “There’s a long line of
Aboriginal men in the timeline of this country who would stand up and take your place right now if
they had the opportunity. So, if you can find some energy to go and deliver, know that there are
thousands of people standing there with you.”
As his sense of despair deepened, Manning Bancroft flew to Melbourne to talk to his father. After
seeing his son break down over dinner, Mr. Manning encouraged him not to bottle everything up, and
suggested he consider working things through with a counselor. The son took his father’s advice, and
with professional support and reassurance, started changing his behavior. He began surrounding
himself with positive people, seeking support, and sharing his dreams, fears and frustrations. The great
believer in the power of mentorship was finally assembling his own portfolio of mentors.
JMB’s Return from the Brink: To Step Back or Step Up?
In 2013, with regained self-confidence, Manning Bancroft reengaged the organization with a series
of internal changes and program adjustments. They were changes that revitalized the organization.
2013 to 2015: Continuous Experimentation, Change and Renewal
Responding to the growing negativity he had observed, JMB renewed his emphasis on motivating
and developing AIME staff. Convinced that AIME should embrace rather than fight the Millennial
generation’s expectation of fast-track career advancement, he wanted to attract talent not through
compensation but by offering exceptional four- or five-year growth opportunities coupled with

generous fringe benefits. That thinking led to policies stressing personal development experiences,
transparent salary and bonus progression, internal mentoring, and generous leave. He also began
emphasizing a simple operating philosophy: “Do your job, be relentlessly positive, have fun, and don’t
be a d*ckhead.” The resulting employee satisfaction was confirmed when AIME became the only
nonprofit on a leading business magazine’s 2013 list of the 50 best places to work in Australia.
Harnessing the energy of a motivated and ambitious young staff, AIME’s commitment to
innovation led to the birth of an Outreach Model designed to reach schools beyond the limit of a 30-
minute drive from partner Universities. The new model replaced the 15 weekly sessions of the Core
Program with an alternative agenda based on three day-long sessions. An independent University
study found that the Outreach Model’s impact on mentees was comparable to that of the Core Program.
Wanting to change the national narrative around Indigenous inequality, JMB began working on
campaigns to highlight the story of Indigenous success. One such creation was an online show called
AIME’s Got Game that offered mentees a platform to exhibit their talents. Winners flew to Sydney to
create and perform a dance or write and record a song. In another challenge, mentees wrote and
delivered their inaugural speech as the country’s first Indigenous Prime Minister. From 646 entrants,
three finalists were selected to attend a Government House event in Canberra where they met the
Governor General and engaged with politicians from both sides of the House.
Meanwhile, AIME’s ongoing growth in 2013 coupled with an expansion into Western Australia led
to a doubling of the number of high schools served—from 121 to 241. The resulting explosion of staff
size and organizational complexity led JMB to appoint Sam Refshauge as AIME’s first General
Manager. (Exhibit 4) It was a role that the CEO hoped would reduce his many operating demands and
allow him to focus on strategy, renewal, innovation and longer-term vision.
In the midst of this growth and renewal, JMB learned he had won a scholarship to the prestigious
six-week Business Executive Program at Stanford Business School. Despite being the youngest of its
140 participants, Manning Bancroft’s description of AIME’s work and outcomes inspired fellow
students to raise more than $45,000 to support his efforts. As the program ended, the young CEO
observed, “I finally believed what I’d been telling others: anything is possible.”
On his return, JMB was pleased to see that KPMG’s 2014 performance audit confirmed that 93.2%
of AIME’s Year 12 mentees had met their state high school attainment levels. This was 34.7% higher
than the national Indigenous rate and even 6.7% above the national non-Indigenous attainment rate.
He then asked KPMG to study the program’s economic effect and was delighted when findings showed
for every $1 in costs, AIME generated $7 in quantifiable economic benefit.
But by 2015, the organization was stretched thin working to support 1923 mentors at 18 universities
and link them to 4864 Indigenous students in 325 schools (Exhibit 5). So when General Manager Sam
Refshauge left to lead another nonprofit, Manning Bancroft needed a replacement. As he promoted his
National Operations Director, Jess Timmins to the role of Chief Operating Officer, in typical fashion,
he gave her a stretching goal: to grow AIME to serve 10,000 kids with 3000 mentors by 2018.
At 2015-year end, JMB felt AIME was in a good place. Its strong financial position supported a well-
trained staff of 150 who delivered effective programs across five states. (Exhibit 6.) After more than a
decade leading AIME, he finally began to wonder if it was time for him to step back. Other
opportunities certainly beckoned: many in his corporate network had tested his interest in executive
positions or board roles and his political contacts had sounded him out about running for office.

AIME High: A Social Entrepreneur’s Moon Shot
While considering these new options, he was invited to join a group observing the U.S. election
process. The proposed five-month U.S. tour would not only give him the time and space for personal
reflection but would also offer AIME’s leaders a chance to grow. In April 2016 JMB signaled his
intention to step back by naming Jessica Timmins Acting CEO.
Rethinking the Future: Proposing a Revolution
As JMB had imagined, the US tour offered lots of time to think. But the more he traveled, the more
he found himself revisiting a vision that had first emerged three years earlier: if AIME’s mentoring
model—refined over more than a decade—had been so successful in Australia, surely it could be
transferred to other countries and applied to other groups suffering from educational inequality.
JMB’s Radical Proposals: Visionary Ideas or Forces of Disruption?
As this conviction deepened and the means to achieve it became clearer, Manning Bancroft wrote
to AIME’s board outlining his new ideas. In Australia, he proposed a radical new vision of ending
educational inequality for all 160,000 Indigenous kids in the school system by 2025. To do this, he said,
AIME needed to fundamentally transform its operating model from one designed to deliver effective
mentoring and evolve to become an organization committed to giving away its expertise by teaching
others how to mentor. “Nonprofits it shouldn’t be growing,” he said. “We should be putting ourselves
out of business.”
Equally radical was his proposal that AIME should simultaneously expand its mission from ending
educational inequality for Australian Indigenous kids to one of using mentoring as a tool to relieve
educational disadvantage wherever it occurred worldwide. He believed that the broad philosophy and
practical tools developed and refined in Australia could be applied to help Sudanese refugees in France,
underprivileged women in India, inner-city kids in the United States, or disadvantaged children in
Africa. All that was needed was to identify a handful of motivated, committed, energetic university
students to whom they could transfer AIME’s knowledge and provide ongoing support.
In a board meeting convened via videoconference to discuss his proposals, JMB told his board that
if they supported both the new ambitious Indigenous goal and his radical new global mission, he
would return immediately as CEO and commit to staying on for five years to deliver on the new
strategy. It was 2 AM in Toronto when he connected on the call, and after making his impassioned
presentation, he held his breath as he waited for a response.

AIME Program: Goal Setting Session Outline
Research has indicated that, when helping students to set goals, the following issues are important to bear in
mind (Egan 1998; Geldard 1999; Kottler 1993; Westwood 1997).
a.Set goals that are related to the identified issue for the student.
b.State goals as specific outcomes to motivate or drive behaviour. Whenever possible, talk through what
the mentee will do, where, when, how often etc.
c.Attempt to establish goals that can be measured or verified.
d.Construct goals that are realistic and attainable.
e.Identify sub-goals to achieve the larger goal.
f.Provide feedback to evaluate progress and identify hurdles.
g.Be aware that the language used is suitable to the student’s ability.
h.Set realistic time lines to achieve goals (Minimum of three weeks).
i.Help students internalise the value of achieving success through their goal attainment.
Suggested Goal Setting Activity
1.Have student draw a timeline from age 10 till present, recording dates and major events in their lives. It
may help if the mentor constructs a similar timeline for themselves.
2.Have the student extend their timeline two years into the future, writing down goals they would like to
achieve. Help the student shape their goals so they are attainable.
•
•
The goals should relate to different areas of the students’ lives: school, home, hobbies, interests,
relationships, and sports are good areas to explore.
Students might start their goal sentences using these phrases: “I predict that...” “My resolution
is to . . . ” ”My goal is to . . . ”
Sample goals. . . .
•
•
•
•
3.
My goal is to complete High school and make it to University.
My goal is to improve my writing skills.
My resolution is to read for at least 15 minutes each night before I go to bed.
My goal is to set a standard for future Aboriginal year 12 students at my school.
Pick one goal as an example and have the student identify sub goals to achieve these goals and ways they
can be implemented in everyday life.
Sample sub-goals—
•
Complete High School and make it to Uni
o
o
o
o
To have all equipment for class work.
To have an organised file for each subject.
To learn to use my diary to keep track of work required, including homework.
To stop myself being distracted by others from doing my work.
4.Have the student extend the timeline by another three years and map out some more goals.
5.Ask the student to complete the task for next week’s session and identify at least three sub goals for every
main goal stated for the next two years.

AIME’s Early Goals and Results: Extracts from the 2006 Annual Report
AIME Program Goals:
A large body of research recognises the key role that education can play in reducing long term
disadvantage of Indigenous peoples. By improving students’ academic performance and getting them
complete year 12, AIME is fulfilling key factors in improving the economic and social status of
Indigenous people.
AIME can have far-reaching goals because we focus on education—not just academics, but a holistic
approach where students participate in Respect and Racism workshops alongside Resume Building
sessions, cultural tours and much more.
Our Aims:
•Provide a clear pathway from Year 9 on to Year 12 and beyond.
•Improve self-esteem, communication skills, and work ethic of high school students.
•Improve attendance rates at participating schools.
•Break down social stereotypes of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, creating a sense
of community and belonging.
•Empower Indigenous people with the skills and confidence to succeed in life after school.
•Expose young people to successful Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in all walks of life,
who all believe in the importance of education.
•Create an environment where all participants are proud to learn about Indigenous Australia.
•Focus on engaging Mentees in education and Mentors in practical Reconciliation.
•Play a role in Closing the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.
