the show which talks about the technologies projects and startups driving decentralization and the global cryptocurrency revolution my name is
Sibylle sync with you and my name is Brian crane we're here today with John
clipping jerk he has a has a long history in technology in law and in
thinking about these issues so he is currently is the co-founder of ie cubed they wrote a book to publish a book I
was called Bitcoin Burning Man and Beyond and when we saw the title someone
recommended as me it was like obviously we need to have him on and he's also a research scientist at MIT Media Lab and
previously he was at the Harvard he was the founder of the Harvard Law Lab and he was also at the Berkman Center there
which is I think quite well known for pioneering some of the thinking about internet law so John thanks so much for
joining us today well thank you for having me I'm looking forward to the conversation yeah absolutely so you've been thinking about
some of these issues that have come up with Bitcoin now for a long time many of
you of course will not be familiar with you work but can you give a little bit of an introduction about what has
brought you here to start thinking about you know blockchain and how that fits in
well for many years I've been very active involved in so the intersection of technology and policy in society and
going back to my College years when I was in help set up the first sort of protests against the
end of the war in Vietnam I was by actively involved in the civil rights movement and the blab perked with a
black panther program so and I and I've also been it's in the whole area of development and at developing countries
as a research associate Harvard many years ago in the end their program for
information resources policy looking developing countries and I've always tried to track and see how technology
shapes people and people shape technology and how the interaction between the two and in that interest
I've also did my sort of graduate work and been fascinated by the notion of
cybernetics and self-organizing systems and this goes back into the way back in the 80s and 70s actually even well how
do you design systems that are self-organizing that a goal-directed that correct themselves that can learn
and there was a lot of activity then a lot of it came out of MIT in those years
and but the computational power wasn't there really to build systems that could
do that my PhD thesis was basically designing a model of language language
discourse generation and cognition that was highly distributed and saying how
can you control complex linguistic and cognitive processes in a just how you centralized way so the whole what's
happened in Bitcoin more recently in the rival of the currency again this is
something I've been interested with people like Bernard wheelchair who does work was a designer of the euro written
extensively on currency design and how currencies reflect policies is something
that currencies are not neutral with respect to policies and if you look at how you can affect policy not just
economic policy or social policy the nature of the currency becomes very important hence when Bitcoin came and
the horizon was arrived it was very fascinating to me and actually when we
first formed id cubed we had a meeting a dinner at the State House in
Massachusetts where the revolution began and we had a big dinner celebrating the revolution in the financial services
industry primarily where we handed out gold coins that said in data we trust
and we tried to get Bitcoin people to come to our event but that way there was really early I think was Bitcoin was
selling at $12 that but it was it was the idea that you could have a highly
decentralized open source incentives mechanism that actually could launch it change and challenge a lot of current
institutional structures which I always believe now are failing their their
artifacts of another era and they're really if you look at the the
institutions that we have designed their artifacts and the Enlightenment when America had three million people not
three hundred and thirty million people when we didn't have the technology it's just it doesn't scale other wonderful
principles there but we really have to think fundamentally about institutional design governance itself so the idea
that you can have the ledger and then that you can assign for things without having a third party and you can run
scripts and run contracts on top of that that execute certain and prove certain premises are really important when I was
at the Berkman Center started the law lab there developed a self-executing
contract then we took it a a Wilson CD
term sheet and made it into a program and then we provide genic genetic algorithms to generate new variants of
that and and proved that you could actually have contracts that are
computation approval well that was in the nineteen eighty two thousand eleven
and twelve I guess known even early on that link in 2009 so we were anticipating what happened with a theory
and the smart contracts another say we're the first but I think we're on the
edge of a very profound revolution and know how to think about currencies and institutions so the idea of
decentralization distribution was was was part of it before and then I guess we have a Bitcoin oh yeah here mall
it just sort of all came together right because exactly I'm curious how you achieved that how do you achieve the I
guess precursors for smart contracts without blockchain technology how did you achieve the decentralization aspect of it
well we didn't we didn't we didn't focus on the decentralization aspect of it I mean where our focus was and how do you
look at a contract as a program and how do you make it algorithmic and so what
we did is I mean we created a list program in which we represented sort of
the we translated the terms of the contract into lists programs and so you could change you could change the
language of the contract say the terms of participating preferred to do the to
common and someone could see the effect on their on their cap table they could say oh my god you know I didn't realize
that when you change this that my my shareholdings go from 30 percent to 3
percent and then we tied it into actuarial tables and and that was
another thing that we were able to show that the likelihood given the Kaufmann
did a lot of studies on this was that they're very low likelihood that people would be able to get an exit the way
they thought they were so it was an attempt to prove a concept and then be able to write a program that was
provably complete and using genetic algorithms which is a nice nice feature
to that that was really cool we could generate a lot of variants sets are
Fitness conditions on the outcomes that we wanted and see how we could approximate a solution that took in two
different the different intentions so you mentioned in the beginning that your
focus was sort of has been on the intersection between technology and and policy and when I was reading your white
paper one thing that struck out to me is that you seem to think of technology as
something very political and you often hear the phrase that technology is neutral and especially in the Bitcoin
space many people say like bitcoin is neutral so how do you think about these
issues well I think that you know technology I mean and there's some people that written so I made Kevin
Kelly's and written some great pieces on it uh Brian Arthur who's an economist has
written a thing it's sort of a as technology as almost an evolutionary force we co-evolved with technology so I
don't think we can disentangle ourselves a technology can technology reflects human intention and human understanding
it also reflects the relative power equations of different people with
access to resources I think when you look at the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
protocol that inherent in that is a certain assumption about a public and
private goods and this is what this is one of my concerns about this the
community and understanding that these these problem has been been thought about for quite some time and so it's it
but the difference between a public and a private good a difference between a one-time game a multiplayer game you
start to look at game theory and you start to think well what what forms of
what forms of cooperation reponsible in order to get a stable outcome and for a
preferred distribution of goods or services and the Bitcoin reflects a particular private goods model so like a
one-time game and it's very sort of in your Chicago school it is a reflects
that mentality of impersonal exchange one time game it's a one time player and
it's an incentive that is sort of a zero-sum game so you know each time you're doing the mining you you don't
you know you don't know the identity the person that you assume that everyone's out for themselves so there's a high
trustless I mean you don't trust anyone therefore you're gonna need to create a mechanism and that verifies the
consensus the proof of work that verifies the the transaction but there
are other incentive mechanisms and and I should also say that the Bitcoin itself is sort of like it's sort of a it's a
it's an they call it's officially a demand back current chairman backed asset that's how the US Commodity
Exchange it defines it it's a very fascinating definition because it's not grounded any
real asset but it's still core sort of a gold-bug kind of thing idiot and I think
that was the intention and you're gonna limit it's deflationary it's so it really can be highly speculative in that
way so it reflects a particular view of a class of currency there are other kinds of currencies that are different
and and this is true throughout history you have you have like two different currency models typically ones gold the
other is silver and one is to create liquidity and create interaction but
bitcoin is sense is built on the sense that you don't trust a central authority and that you have to limit the the
issues of the coin and so it is sort of rival aside there some why I have it
someone else but it's not the more you create the more deflationary less value
it has but there's thinking about digital information base currencies that are
what I call cooperative currencies and this is based upon a lot of people's work but I would have reference Brian
Arthur who is an economist and works in the Santa Fe Institute and talks about the theory of increasing returns and
that's a different model it says information when you're in a digital world you know that the more the
information is disseminated aborning people possess it the more value it has whereas in a physical latest asset say
is gold its rival is so you're creating shortages you're creating you're speculating and shortages and you make
money off the difference between the salaat supply and demand the shortage where the information based currency you
actually want wide acceptance and and the broader the that information flows
the greater value for everybody yes I I saw that as well that part was quite striking how you talked about that but
don't you think that for money or a currency to be valuable it has to be scarce no I think it has to have
inherent value I also think and actually made the point in the white paper and Bernard to tear the the in minute he's a
currency designer they will say you need both and I the analogy I make I think is
is in the paper is to the the the kinda people familiar
with it there's a program called Deadwood which sort of like the settling of the West and when you didn't have
rules and you didn't have and we're sort of the survival of the fittest you really you want you want to have a
currency that is like Bitcoin it's like gold you can trust it in its here itself you don't read you don't depend upon a a
party to accept it it's a one time game as a zero-sum game either have it or you have it but is what happens is you start
to get repeat games and then you start to get ideas of boundaries and the sheriff's and you have different ways of
creating cooperative behavior then you want another currency that is it is
cooperative and it increases by the value of use and this is where you know that and this is there's a lot of stuff
in game theory on this is is that when you have a repeat game you yeah and you
know the person you develop working with and you have a reputation metric you can create higher outcomes for everybody
doing that and I also cited the work by Mike Novak they're a lot of work that's
being done in evolutionary biology that says this is also true biological systems that you have higher outcomes to
the evolutionary stable solutions when you have some kind of collaboration
through known reputational identity you have to have the reputation and then you
do with a CAA shear a sort of one-time
game rival as' outcome yeah what would such a currency action affect oh well I
mean there's something where you're either a number of people are developing these things and I actually Primavera is
you mentioned we had talked about earlier have some ideas of this but there's we're looking at some like an
artisan coin where artisan currency were and I've been referenced a bit coined
and Burning Man with that when I was in Bernie Madoff talking Larry Harvey and they were talking he was talking about what he would like to have a gift kind
of currency that would be in other words people acknowledge what other people do and they get they accrue some kind of
credits for that and those credits are are can be they
can be exercised in the context of a a different kind of social contract so if
you go to Burning Man and you have all these people working together basically for a public good and you have you have
you you have mechanical engineers you have carpenters you have all these
people coming together builds up and if what we'd like to Larry was seeing a lot
of people like to acknowledge us so it's like a gift exchange currency that and that people who are able to knowledge
what other people do and you can actually develop so social capital that way well that's a bit and in order to do
that you're you're looking at something as a repeat game it's not ribose in the end when you look at an artisan economy
you want to buy something not be you don't want to crease you don't want to face shortages you want to go back and
you want to have a repeat experience with someone who you value for what they create it's not a standardized product
it's not a what would you're valuing is what is unique about it and you want to
be able to then bring other people to appreciate that you and it's not a you're not rival it's you want to work
with them to be successful and it's a their success is your success so it ties into empathy and shared theories of mine
that's another area a lot of work has been and done in evolutionary biology that that's a a critical aspect when
people have shared theories of mind then they are their coordination costs and their social value Korea is great vastly
increase but do you think that's compatible with the I guess current state of the world of the economy and how a large part we're moving away from
artisan economies well I I mean I think we're actually moving back to or that I I think I think they're seeing a failure
of the I mean the classic fairies in Wall Street I mean as a case in point I
I actually think we're gonna move away from that I and I and I'm not saying
that you're not going to have things like a Bitcoin or a gold base or a limited I think you're gonna have the
combination of the two because you're always going to have cases where people cheat and fail one another so you
have to you have to have something that is sort of trust us but the the benefits
of having an identity and having a reputation and being able to to
distribute and create resources around that I think far outweigh the the
artificial creation of shortages which really don't exist there chokepoints that benefit some parties so that's
where your power laws come in and that's and that's what and that's why you have this huge disparity of wealth and that
Gini index kind of things accentuating because you people think oh that's a natural consequence you got preferential
attachment therefore you get power laws we can't doing about that I don't agree with that at all
today's show is brought to you by our friends at shape-shift of course shape-shift is the fast and easy way to trade all coins and then I'll support
over forty five of the most popular all coins including counterparty ripple gems
and so many others that I've never even heard of and they now support you guessed it ether since the release of
the frontier launched shape ships has added ether to the list of supported currencies and so now you can buy ether
and start building some sort contracts on aetherium now there is a small caveat and this is true for every exchange at
the moment is that it can take up to six hours for you to get your transaction confirmed but just stay patient and
you'll get some ether and you'll start build really cool smart contracts very soon and just as if ether wasn't enough they're
also doing this cool thing with a gaming company called spells of Genesis that's putting some of these in-game assets on
on the blockchain and and one of those they're selling in a very limited amount like 25 every week only on on
shape-shift so that's called the wander and it's called spells of Genesis so if your game or if your interest not check
it out because of course it's a very interesting way to make this sort of fake scares acid actually scares by by
using the blockchain so head over the shapeshifter yo and give it a try would like to thank shape shape for their
support of epicenter Bitcoin I guess what becomes very central in
what you're talking about then though is the question of identity note because if you have yes I know I miss party that
can just join well you can exactly like this the abuse that can happen exactly
right so all societies with their when they really succeed I mean people have
internalize a and this is when the points I tried to make rather than have a state imposed administrative Noren so
basically you want people to internalize and generalize certain codes of conduct that it's in their interest to be adhere
to and hold so when you have really strong reputation Allah denta T signals that you can be relied upon then you
eliminate enormous amounts of inefficiency in this society you don't and you actually create much more
abundance so the identity component is very very important in my mind and I think that the same time is the fact
that people this is where the notion of self sovereign identity becomes very important is that I could he unrolls
controls so if the government issues identity credential the bank does that basically have their the control point
and so we're talking about a new kind of third a new kind of third party organization it's not private sector
it's not public sector it's more like an open source sector and there's a set of protocols I can go through then I can I
can establish my identity Senate established certain certificates that other people rely upon they'll take that
risk and I can build upon that and I can control I've control over my own data that I can
create legitimate credentials express who I am that other people can rely upon and that flattens Authority structure
that we currently have that's very static and there's like tens of thousand years old we're still running society on
a patriarchal lineage system you know that goes back into our our
deep past I mean so if I can oversimplify that that model then rather
than having say the government issue identity cards and that becomes your sole means of proving your identity you
have multiple sources which can together come together and form a right a
consensus around who you are but however I mean identity on the Internet is
something that is quite malleable what you can make it non malleable I mean I
mean you can have multiple identities everyone's gonna have yet and you imprint right that's the point I wanted
to make so then young does that the fact that we can have multiple identities not cause a problem for order yeah yeah it
does you that's why you have to anchor it in a root identity in other words you can't let someone gain the system I mean
and this is you know this is what the problems were they had willing way back to PayPal things like that that you you
could you can you know you gain the system and then you can get people to trust in a particular persona identity
and then you can change and screw them so you need and you need to anchor it in
something you I need to anchor my identities in a root identity what we mean by root identity is something is
tied to me to my biological physical cell now I don't need to have that
identity be fully disclosed I can have it be authenticated and anonymous and I
can so I can have in a persona out there that has certain verified attributes but
doesn't reveal Who I am on a pii basis I can I can reserve that how would you tie
to your physical identity to these other identities what you have to do and
actually this um work we're doing on you need you need to get a collection of unique identifiers it's almost saying
that I as an individual have certain unique patterns that distinguish me from
anyone else so those can be biometric and behavioral metric patterns and in
combination they create something that I don't remember like an eigenvector that uniquely identifies me and I can in it
you know and I can encrypt that and I can verify that and I can I can prevent
and use that as a core credential how do you prevent that input data isn't forged
well I mean they're there they're all there you're always good to everyone it's an arms race and how these things
have we all know but what you can do is mitigate the
vulnerability of having multiple dimensions of these things so and they can be updated in real time the other
thing with that that we're learning and this may reverence an earlier conversation is the idea of cybernetic
versus of models of software models is that your constant we're constantly
getting data updated all the time so we can compute our our metrics so we can
cube compute our distributions on the fly and and and we can have one-time
token so we can have week and we have highly decentralized a distributed
system it's very difficult actually Wendy with these new kind of architectures to basically smooth them
over its not say can't be done but if the cost goes up dramatically particularly given what we have now
which is totally archaic so where do you
see it so let's project like 10 years in the future what do you see the state of identity
being then are we still looking at a system where we have a higher I think they I don't think it's going to be
hierarchical I think I think this this revolution is imminent I really and I think bitcoins is a huge me is a huge
vector for that change and I think that I mean I was just talking to the the CIO
of the the new CIO the federal government Tony Scott and and he's he he
basically buys into the whole idea of the centralized blockchain based services for identity and for government
security and they have something called security by design they're looking at and that's a very decentralized system
so that brings us to the topic of governance then you know there are
there's been a rise of decentralized technologies the recent years especially due to the rise in Bitcoin and in in
their circles many have suggested that governance could be decentralized becoming more and more obvious with the
recent release of aetherium and people have speculated that governments
governance and institutions could be centralized what are the first i mean
i'm we always we always hear these these like these ideas but with no real concrete right what what are that one of
the things that could be decentralized so were you think the first areas of decentralized governments are going to
come from what are the first things that governments are going to start to decentralized essentially well i think
the one of the things that you can do in a decentralized manner of so much more
effectively and not only in terms of coordination cost and expense and everything else is and this is where the
blockchain is so amazing i mean and you met you look at remittances and payments and being able to verify transactions
and identities and do that through smart contracts and hold and be able to hold
hold money or hold identities or Hearle hold some asset in escrow and release it
when it when provided the appropriate credentials that is so pervasive and i
think what you're looking at the fight and I've worked with a number of banks and how they totally help them rethink
what they're doing and what happens is you have a regulatory structure right now in a banking structure as a
hub-and-spoke model and they and there's this impossible preponderance of cost that for financial regulation that makes
the regulations by the time they're written they're out of date they're huge costs they only served in many cases to
to help the incumbents but yet it increases burden the fact that you can decentralize the payments and
remittances systems in a distributed way and have oversight then is basically
there you can use smart contracts you can use multi-party computation methods
the variety of ways in which you can do it that's gonna unlock so much value and have so much savings it's just it can't
be resisted I mean I look at this as very analogous that we're having two banks is what happened to the newspaper industry say
15 years ago and they you know they thought oh well not affect us will become portals will adapt no they come
they could not adapt it's a very different model so it really affects them and and so that's you know
that's that's the thing that I think you're gonna see and I think another area that that is interesting is it's
all idea of a location-based data and an Internet of Things and I mean how are we gonna scale Internet of Things without
having some kind of decentralized autonomous contracts into that you know I think that's that's an inevitability
and I have dealt with a number of say companies car companies they're
capturing all this location data as things like that and the question there are they're in breach of the EU data
directive but if you have API calls and enforce the the regulations through API
calls then then you don't have to have a high you know governance it can be done very well and and I think that these are
the areas of which you can see some of the innovations coming there's all sorts of companies they're working on various
aspects of this so you mentioned the newspaper industry and so that that they
did have the the monopoly of information but they don't have an imposed monopoly that monopoly could and has been
dethroned the the difference with governments is that the monopoly is imposed by power right
what apart from the cost savings potentially which I think are pretty obvious don't you think government
governments would have and institutions would have resistance to decentralizing their institutions since they would
essentially be losing control like they're I don't I don't know if they're ready for that paradigm shift well I
think what you're seeing is a failure of traditional governance institutions so they're genuine looking that they losing
legitimacy I mean this is what this election is all about we wanted to call it and and so I think and what you're
seeing in certain cities is I think and this is what's interesting there's a lot
of move in the cities and there's I think the maker movements and cities the idea to give citizen participation I we
talked about I'm talking about in several areas what I call governance free zones
it's like Enterprise rezone allow people to actually start to take over and run some of the local services and agencies
their housing authorities and they're whole lots of traditional government
functions that that are performed so poorly I mean Tim O'Reilly talks about this as government as a platform and and
and that you should allow people you know a lot of sort of API access of different services but actually in the
delivery of the services too and you can start to you create competing institutions that that that could
compete with a traditional government way of dispersing benefits actually in
the UK they're looking at this developing a gun dispensing of benefits and so you're
creating a new kind of currency around benefits that can only be used within a certain context and that creates a
different kind of micro economy and people will start experimenting with that and I think that's gonna be much
more effective more responsive more in savings more engaging participatory and
will happen is the government's will say okay well we're gonna move up will become more meta will let will let will
let these decentralized networks provide more of the function and will set certain ground rules and actually there
was a something called n stick which national trial was strategy were trusted identities in cyberspace that came out
of the bomb ministration they were saying yeah maybe around identity and personal data the government trust
doesn't try to fear out at all the details they just set up the the meta rules and provides safe harbor
provisions allow people experimenting it and and and try to establish those
minerals I think that's what's going to happen do you think that this change so
you mentioned that the government's doing some of this change do you think that's more the way it's gonna happen or
you think the people will just sort of create these quasi governmental organizations using block chains that
then will take on some of the functions but without actually the permission or endorsement from proper governmental
bodies well here's what you're doing already you're seeing this already if you look at uber
you look at Airbnb you know well you know uber is what a forty five billion dot they're breaking all the rules and
and but there and there they achieve such scale and they actually probably
benefit the people one and there's a whole set of services that that are
going against the traditional government models and regulations they're forcing the government to change and and I think
you're gonna see that pervasive so the government is gonna have to adapt to these changes and it's gonna have to reframe its role not to say it's gonna
roll over and not to say there's not going to be a lot of resistance but I think in the US for example I think
there's a huge disaffection with the the the role of the federal government it's just it isn't it's not that these things
shouldn't be done I mean this is a tension between the progressives and the tea party in the bluegrass roots and the
bitcoiners and this is a libertarian view um I mean I I think in the extreme
libertarian views it's like there there's and that's of the chicago school there's like no oversight do not tread
on me you know I don't want you can't tell me what to do and there's no sense of community and responsibility I think
that's extreme uh I do think they're gonna come you're gonna reframe the problem it's not gonna be a big
government solution that just doesn't work that doesn't scale but you have to have governance and you have and you're
gonna government's becomes a kind of technology just imagine if you're able to have governance as a technology and
that starts to innovate the way you have in Moore's Law that just changes everything and I think there are
problems fundamental problems that have been around forever it's like who guards
the guards in this whole idea but that can be solved I really believe they can be solved through zero knowledge proof a
new kind of technologies that that will make that maybe not solve all the cases but 80/20 and make a huge difference so
we're at we're at a threshold of being able to solve some very intractable problems about how people run the govern
themselves and I find that very exciting one of the things you mentioned that I
thought was it was a great point regarding that is that if you have a regular government
body or some sort of institution right over time they start having employees and their rules and of course those
people start having their own interests and all of a sudden you know when it was just supposed to provide a service now
it has its own right interesting I think you know in Europe for example with the
you and ECB and and all those one sees that extremely strongly and I think in
the u.s. is also a great example where yes the government's has an enormous power and and I think it's interesting
to think that oh maybe with decentralized autonomous organizations and things like that right where this
sort of transparent rules and it really isn't something in the middle that start
taking on its own interest maybe we're afraid of some of that corruption
absolutely I think that's a huge hugely important I I think what happens with
bureaucracies is they and in government is they become their own interest group and then as their own interest group
they are they allocate resources and budgets in terms of perpetuating
themselves rather than their constituencies and I think we need to open that up and be centralizing that
and actually make I mean it returns back to a notion that well maybe those functions can be distributed out broadly
in the community so the way you do it in an open source movement there are people that have certain this is where the credentials and reputation becomes
really important so if I had a really strong set of credentials that were a stem win and I could then solve a quote
government problem ah and and collections of people could do that so
it doesn't have to be this hard divide between what's public and private sector that's why I think that's a false
dichotomy here and not just public and private sector but what you what you
call in your white paper citizen sourcing and it's what you're mentioning that right so yeah I really think citizen sourcing is a real option here
and and you can and it's just not you know a do good feel good I mean you can have a high level professionalism in a
citizen's competency and and that is the way I mean look whether the Athenian democracy when I work it
was a very short period of time but actually republics when they work that's why they worked and and and and then the
best part of the when the US and early phases that that's why it worked and even the early Roman Republic was that
way you had you have people and take an active role in government and it wasn't
a print and they weren't there to lard their nest I mean the when I see this
time another generation when I when I was I did work in Washington helped set up an agency there and I you went there
with the intent of giving back it was a public service thing it wasn't a way of bootstrapping your career now it's just
like Washington is owned by K Street I mean it's it's that's the fact and the
Supreme Court is that's fine you know go ahead so this is Jan I did really so it
is sort of really is undermined the core democratic principle be listening to
this show in parts thanks to all the support we get from our great sponsors we have some some fantastic companies
who work with and we're very proud of what they do and of their products and the companies be happy to stand behind
every week we reach a large audience of thousands and thousands of people deeply
involved in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency space people running companies people having a lot of influence and people who
are just enthusiastic about technology about progress in about the future so if
you're involved in a project or startup and think that reaching our audience could help you emails show at epicenter
Bitcoin calm and let's talk now with the idea of citizen sourcing this come to
mind so I mean I agree that you know given for instance let's say you have a neighborhood and you know there are
issues or problems in that neighborhood who better to solve those problems and the people actually living in it than perhaps a local government or federal
government or what-have-you coming in and trying to solve those but where does that citizen sourcing stop because it
seems like there seems to me that you could have a risk there if you start getting into you know citizens ensuring
security since policing that sort of thing where you could get into some sort of touchy situations there a really good question
III think I I do think that you know you
you have to you you have to think of an architecture of governance and accountability and transparency so you
really need to architect institutions to perform different functions and and you
need to hold them accountable so when I think it's a sort of it's not like crowd
sourcing just throw everything out no I think there's there's there's a set of different kinds of institutional designs
and roles for that that you need to establish and and it's an opt-in system
I mean so and people have different preferences as to how much and how little they want to be governed and this
and that and they're they're you know they're natural differences in personality and disposition but I I
think there are ways and it's an empirical issue is how to design certain
kinds of efficacious institutions and and so if corruption is an issue well
then how do you if you're using certain forms of encryption in a very authentication and you can do chain of
custody on data and you have you have Ledger's that you can audit and you can
rotate in and out people in positions of power in a in a non gheymeh belay and I
think you can then you can create more effective kinds of institutions of oversight that in cells learn rather
than try to arrest development and try to protect a special set of interest and
and this can be an area of genuine innovation experimentation and and then
I think there are certain empirical solutions that one can test have we seen
this before in history those are the varying examples of this sort of citizen governance we're we're moving into an
era you know whether you believe this singularity literally we are having a convergence of technologies and how we
think about technologies is how we build our futures and that's never happened
before I mean we can you know we can we can hack the human brain we can hack our
genome we can hack everything aha and and that's only increasingly true so
and that's when I in the paper I made a big emphasises is that to understand the magnitude of those changes and put them
in a historical context and the kind of things that we're doing not see it in such isolation of a particular expertise
but we are we are things are up for grabs well yeah I think that's also one
of my expectations and hopes is that when you start having blockchains maybe integrated in all kinds of areas and all
kinds of systems and initially of course often it will be because there's a commercial benefit to it right it's it's
cheaper it makes something possible that wasn't possible before but then over time actually the effect and that might
even be a secondary effect often is that actually reduces corruption it reduces some of these flawed incentives that we
have today oh yeah I mean I don't I I don't look at as a secondary intent I look at as a design point I mean I
that's what it just made I think yeah I think it's a design point of blockchains
but when people will adopt it in a commercial setting you know they might not do it for that reason that might be
is perfect but I I do think that the the need to have things that are I mean
trust is important in commercial settings transparency and predictability and how do you manage risk I mean those
actually all create value and so with and I think the ability to create
systems to perform that way I mean if you have a highly trusted highly learning system
there's rapidly evolves and changes and is able to to maintain high levels of
sort of value creation versus one that is openly maybe not governed but hacked
and not and porous it's a it's going to out-compete that I just I just think
we're at a point of different kinds of competing institutional economic designs
today's magic word is mustard mu s ta RT but less sucky ENCOM to sign in enter
the magic word and claim you're part of a listener award so this ties into a lot
of your work regarding cybernetics and AI I've often had this sort of idea that
you know smart contracts although they are very primitive individually together
when you have multiple smart contracts it starts to resemble a living that
multiple start smart contracts are interacting with each other and doing all the writings they it starts to look
like a living organism oh is that how you see it oh I definitely see that I
mean I think we're I mean and by a living organism and that's where cybernetics is so interesting and and
people I feel are not familiar with cybernetics but though all ideas go lemme it was a theological system
mysticism headed goals and had feedbacks and tried to maintain certain equilibria it could be dynamic equilibrium there
could be multiple systems working together but it's like well how do you
how do you approximate living things through cybernetic mechanisms or and and you see and I've always been interesting
the work that's done by the Santa Fe Institute in which they've really started working on this 25 years ago and
I think what you'll find is that the notion of cybernetics is sort of mutated in the notion of of complex adaptive
systems and where's John Holland's work and that's gotten very sophisticated and
and and applied to lots of different fields I think there's a rich body of
knowledge on looking at things this way but a lot of it does come out of the Santa Fe Institute and looking at social
systems that this way those guys work of Sam Bowles her Gettis there there's just
and really fascinating and very rigorous ways of understanding social
organization and how people adapt and change and don't let change and what are the factors that affect them so we're
getting a very sophisticated understand sort of adaptation and I an evolution
and how different kinds of organisms adapt and I'd recommend the work of Martin Novak who runs the evolutionary
dynamics Center at Harvard and his group as a whole it's very rigorous work and
it can be applied to do designing social institutions I mean we're all part of
the same evolutionary process looking at it from that angle of you know the study
of self-organizing organisms what do you think of the design of Bitcoin or the
way it functions well I think there was you know I mean is it really brilliant I
mean yet you're just I I think that I mean when you when you consider all the
things that were pulled together and there was a is this seem to be a single
person's effort and to get the incentive mechanisms right I mean and and then be
able to launch something like that I think it was a is this extraordinary and it's that our epic 'el I mean uh not and
I think it I'm not sure how you could have done it so I may disagree with certain things I say but that's part of
the evolutionary paradigm of it and you know there is a lot of debate about you know private blockchains public
blockchains what do you know what kind of currency design what kind of incentive mechanisms or consensus
mechanisms you're going to use I mean they're they're its broad in that discussion and whether proof of work is
really what's required particularly in an ecological way and if you have identities and you can able have
whitelist then do you really need such an onerous consensus mechanism that kind
of thing but in the fact that something like that took off I mean it's but it's
the same it's the same basic phenomenon you have you know in any kind of
peer-to-peer distributed system and so I I you know I law time it was just it was
great it changed you know it created possibilities where there were none say four or five years ago
if you've seen that he respects your thoughts on this I don't know if you've seen this really fascinating talk my my career that he gave a couple years ago
at Google exploring the idea of autonomous vehicles and how you could
have autonomous vehicles that were basically a public good and responding
to markets and and and you know going where those demand and then perhaps like shutting off for a while when there's no
demand or moving to another city and and the idea that those vehicles could essentially run themselves and then the
question is you know who owns the vehicle accurate if you have a market of these and it could be vehicles it could
be drones it could be you know whatever is that does that constitute an artificial intelligence or to you or yes
I just devices responding to I mean I mean yeah I mean you know and I'm very I
just give a keynote on the internet of things a group of Massachusetts was focusing on that and I think that the
Internet of Things what what is your having more autonomous things people
think oh you got to have people in the loop all the time you can't scale it and have people on this so therefore you
have to allocate certain agency to the device that's inevitable and then the
question is to what extent is that that device acting on your behalf and if it is not then how do you revoke that that
set of privileges and and when you start to think about the Internet of Things I mean these things are pretty smart
things these are ARM chips I mean that's sort of the basic you know the 64-bit ARM chips you're having things that that
and then they can tie in a little cloud so if you look at computing so yeah I just was looking at some of these new
drones and Nick you know you can have autonomous drones and now from an a a high point of view which would blew the
top of my head off of was you know the problem with AI and my generation was it
was very rule-based and very brittle and and so you did and you didn't have a lot of data coming in so you didn't have the
ability to do dynamic modeling and verification and and and do real-time
computation so there was everything was tried to capture in a brittle set of rules now that's not the case
so you can have and you can have drones flying in the wild and they can know what a window is not naked there are
also things that they've never seen before that they can make reasonable judgments about so and then you can tie
into the cloud so the drone is as smart as the cloud and these things can work
in formation and of course when you weaponize them you you you're creating
quite a foe and I we have not thought that through and and and one of the
area's we've really not fought through and this is where you people it's all personal data privacy who gives a damn these are classic these are who you are
these these are new it's that is data is a new asset class they're pertinent and it's got to be signed and verified I
mean the the no carries running into this issue and that they don't know whether they have control over a drone
or a satellite because they can't they can't sign for the lead for the data that goes in it they can't verify their
provenance of it and that that's happening in spades and throughout the
net I mean if you look at your home should be your castle it should be the heart of privacy well you've got a
Samsung TV in there that's watching everything you're doing and doing a racial recognition voice recognition and
feeding it back and selling it it's a surveillance device you same thing with nest and now there's no there's there's
no design point that gives you control over that data and what you want them to see you can't you can't intervene and
control that and that's just going to escalate this is this is not a good situation it's time for our word from
our sponsors vault or comm the gold the Bitcoin exchange now we all know there's been no shortage of Bitcoin exchange
scams and hacks in these recent years and that's why when Philip and Josh
the two brothers behind vulturo decided to start that exchange in the wake of the mount GOx disaster they wanted to do
things differently so they're really pushing the bar forward and innovating in terms of security transparency and
audit ability to ensure that customer funds are safe secure auditable and so
there's no there's none of this mount GOx you know stuff going on it's all on the
up-and-up so if you've been listening to the broadcast of course in noble tourer and perhaps you like volt or and you
like what they do well something new is happening something really exciting is happening and that's Walter is doing an
equity crowdfunding campaign through back to the future of Sam Dix neuf course you know as well by this point so
if you're interested you now have chance of actually owning some equity in a start-up which is sort of a new thing
equity crowdfunding and not just a start-up but a great Bitcoin startup the
great startup in his face and you can even invest with Bitcoin so if you're interested check it out that's on bank
to the future so bnk to the future calm and of course we'll put a link in the
show notes and who would like to thank Walter for their support of absent Bitcoin and hope they're gonna have a
fantastic crowdfunding campaign so you you've worked on on a specific software
project - called open mustard seeds right what is a mustard seed open
mustard seed was an open source project that we started about four years ago and
it was in a it was in an effort to and
actually this is a video on it pretty describes it instead of notions to give people control over the personal data
and being able to have the aggregation of a point of personal intent and create trust networks whereby people could have
a principled way of sharing and releasing that data and the key element here is is that in a classic internet
notion the control should be at the edge of the node and then they need the edge
of the node now is now an individual and data and computation and at that point
that you should any other you as an individual should have control of that I
also and as it evolved we had a development called wind hover principles
around personal control of data and sovereignty of individual identity in other words you should have not only
control your data but you could have a control of your identities and by that I mean that in the classic notion he
enrolls controls which means that the government or the banks or some of
RT enrolls you and they basically control your identity and tell you who you are and this is not something you
control in our model you have an open source you have a protocol whereby you control it
and you assert it and other people Villa to to accept that and on the basis of that then you can decide in a
peer-to-peer way how you want to share your data you know we worked on a post mustard open mustard seed we worked on a
peer-to-peer Terms of Service Agreement where everyone in the network is in
parity with everyone else and that other party that other entity could be a company but I have the right to extend
and revoke my data at any point and so I can use access tokens I can do ways of
when time tokens for the release of the data I can verify who's gotten that have it signed for ah but the aggregation
point is the individual and that gives you a 360 degree view of it and therefore if I gonna verify that it
becomes much more valuable to all parties control that sounds that sounds of course fantastic and we've talked
often about you know topics and ideas like that on this show but at the same time it seems like where the world is
going it's not that direction right you have larger and larger institutions gathering more and more data and of
course very often their commercial interest is very much tied with the ownership of that data so do you think
this really has a chance yeah I mean I ya know I've been pushing this rock up a
hill for 10 15 years and I could so I've seen it I've seen a whole change in attitude over the last five or six years
and what I'm also in the World Economic Forum we came out with a notion of
personal data as a new asset class that people should have control over it that was adopted there there's also there is
the the consumer data Bill of Rights in the US government adopts that position
so does the EU adopt I position this and now even someone like GM sa which is the
trade association for mobile phone operators believe that people should
have control and data the fact is they wanted they they want to be the people at hosted monetize it
but there's a recognition that in a classic internet notion that that if you
can push it to the edge you can create more value in that because you're able to have a natural aggregation point and
what you're finding is companies like Target you know all these these data breaches have happened is create a
liability for companies and holdings that they really don't want to have the P I the personal identifying data they
would like to have access to rich verifiable data that can build a relationship with a customer so if you
give them API access in a protected way in a better way and they offload the
liability they're very very happy with that so I believe then there are strong
incentives for major companies and I've talked to them I mean I've talked a lot of banks agree with number of banks
bring with me on this one I can't say which ones but huge banks and they're
they're welcome there's also major brands welcomed this so I think this actually is where it's going to go yes
you have the googles and you have the Facebook's that monetize your data and this is where the big battle begins
because you can see where Google and we're in there collecting all the data about us and I have no control over that
they're gonna they're gonna try to be an identity provider and they're gonna try to monetize it through advertising I think advertising is a dead model too
and there's a lot of people in advertising your knowledge on because once you know a lot about people and the
the penis matches that actually if I get enough data I can get people what they want
that's a different model than advertising where you're sort of scattershot and you're and you're making money on just being able to to spam
people and you get all these false hits now that I think that's gonna change dramatically so I think you're gonna
have a different business model and so when you get a different businesses model and their value proposition at
different economics then you're gonna have a shift so what what in this model I'm maybe I didn't understand really how
it works but how how do you prevent someone who has access to your data who
to whom you've given access to your data from copying it and keeping it for it for himself well I mean they're they're
they're technology what give them at digging like they're very simple they're about three different
ways you can do that and and I think that there's one model and then this is
something we do didn't oh mighty will say you have you ask questions and you don't get the data you're just asked
questions other data so you really don't possess the data there are ways in which you can actually you can have a
temporary hold on the day and then and bring it back and there are other ways in which you can actually then do it through an act you can actually do it
through in a contract so you're saying the part of your agreement in terms of service agreement is an e party can retracted agreement and data and we
assign for that in na we on the blockchain so you can have that verified
now the party breaches that then they can be spelled from the network and they can be subject to through certain kind
of remedies so I think there's a combination of these things yes you can
always get some bad actor that's gonna hack some kind of weakness in the system but the fact is I I think that you can
increase the cost of that and in such a way that it that you can minima you may
get an edge condition rather than in a central condition that that's an interesting thought it'd have a Terms of
Service on your data because it's something oh yeah terms of services to use Google to use iTunes and essentially
we are subject to their terms but I agree that it would be great if we could
have our own Terms of Service or it does exactly what we use it you can use my data like this you can do this with it right we have I've been working that for
many many years but we've actually now even it's a peer-to-peer Terms of Service Agreement and so you know and
and it's enforced through a smart contract and and so if the person is a
bad actor you you know who they this is it you know who they are you could you they can be a huge reputation all hit and then you can
indeed Higgy and you can do what the greeks did you can throw them out of the city you know that was the when you
expelled someone from the city when they're a bad citizen outside the walls that had a huge cause and you can do
that through contract law this is the interesting governance mechanism particularly in a common law jurisdictions you can do that
you know that that sounds that sounds extremely exciting and yeah I mean I do think if you start having these like
blockchain based maybe systems where it's like reputation on both sides and
maybe things that that become possible so you mentioned before that you're also
working on a start-up can you share about what the goal is and what do you
want yeah yeah I think what we what we recognize is that it's very important to
establish an open source component to to this new ecosystem and and you know one
of the things that I think you asked me earlier isn't what the success of Bitcoin the fact that was all open
source was very huge a huge issue o you plus so you're really trying to
create a resource that is open to other people they can build value on so what
we are about an intrinsic and it is actually being able to support and it
builds on an open source project right now called flux train that has it's it's
was done at a car game L and and that gives people control over there it's as
I quantified self stuff the point is be able to give have someone set up their
own container of their own data and be able to certain certain credentials
about themselves put it on the blockchain that they control and then being able to assert them I think you
create the whole different kind of dynamics that people will have different badges different ways in which they can
assert and thetic a certain attributes of themselves that will enable all sorts
of possibilities now one of the areas that I think is that I mentioned is most
critical is is this what's happening in this new what I call sort of the Gigan
guild economy that's coming out well you look at the maker movement you look at uber you there's a whole you look at
instant cart you look at all these efforts to say well here's an independent contractor
how do we create how do you when they're working for a company you're creating a
certain asset skill assets and to your skills and your accomplishment why shouldn't you as an individual be able
to benefit from that why can't you in turn work through your
own network to create learning value increase your craft but also mitigate
risk and enter into agreements with the uber or the it's the car all these other
kind of service or be a maker I mean what does the maker movement is is is I
think inevitably you're gonna be there and that to me it's like an artisan movement but it's not a guild is not in
the sense the old sense of a guild a guild I think is you yes it's a way in which people can come together and you
can use smart contracts to reduce the enormous friction legal and economic
friction and organizational friction and how to provide how to provide services
so one of the things we're very interested in and comes out of the background at the law lab is how do you
create you know solve the leak there's so many legal contracts that are just very standard agreements that once
people agree to them and I have the right credentials button and get a loan or push a button get a new passport push
a button create a credential around credit that is be independently verify so we're looking at this in this this
new network economy and also in developing countries where there's a huge opportunity and need for that so
that that's sort of the intrinsic value proposition and it's sort of based upon
these principles and how to create basically an API network of a value that
that will bring a new economy and B allow you to monetize this in a very different ways than having the control
of a Google or Facebook like massive participation for lots of different
people to be you sort of distribute the innovative around how to create
credentials how to create value and not have it be captured by a few small big companies
cool well John thanks so much for coming on today and joining us it's really exciting the things you're working on
well thank you very much and she's having to be all part of this together so if if people want to learn more about
your work so we'll of course link to ID cubed and to the Bitcoin and Burning Man
book is there some other place you want to send people to yeah well i'm also to do ID cube eventually what we're gonna
be sending them to to intrinsic as well so that that had again and we'll be able
to do that and be and when we be more official but i the white paper i will be
putting out on the on the ID cube website okay fantastic yeah because you were at a nice black paper that I'm
purchasing graphs a so we can't put a link up yet but yeah yeah if you let us know then you know we can let people
know I would definitely do that and I'm always welcome for feedback I mean this is a living conversation that people
have so I'm always look forward to that ya know think so one last thing before
we wrap up so we started this t-shirt contest basically bribing people so if
you leave us in iTunes review we're gonna do a drawing I think we said want to be but let's do it once a month when
we give out four or something like that and then we send it to you and of course you can say it was the most enlightening
our you ever spent or you can say it was miserable I want my money back so either
is fine and so yeah and and of course if you do that you need to send us an email because we have no way of identifying
