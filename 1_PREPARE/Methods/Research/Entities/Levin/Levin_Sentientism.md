"Reductionism is well-named. It reduces what you can do." - Michael Levin - Sentientism 199


00:00 Clips!
01:18 Welcome
- "We biologists have plenty of spherical cows"
03:50 Mike's Introduction
04:37 What's Real?
- A "not religious but highly spiritual" Jewish background
- Hebrew school " I harrassed everybody with questions.... how souls are supposed to work...the hard problem of consciousness... the answers weren't terribly forthcoming."
- At home "an emphasis on inquiry... asking big questions... things that matter"
- "The question of 'how do I know?' figured prominently in my childhood"
- "Rationality is an amazing tool but one can also ask questions about its limitiations... what are the things that we're not seeing"
- Being sceptical about the approaches you're bringing to a problem
- "I pretty much only have one supernatural belief which is that the universe is understandable... Once you've taken that on everything else becomes possible... I can't think of anything that would be truly supernatural..."
- "We are finite beings" trying to understand reality then "you have to ask yourself 'how is this working out?... is this helping me have a more meaningful life... be a more ethical person... have better relationships with others?'"
- "I don't really think of myself as a biologist... my fundamental commitment... has been to understand embodied mind"
- "I'm interested in cognition, intelligence and inner perspective in a wide range of diverse systems... some of which are alive"
- "I think cognition is a broader category than life"
- "It just so happens that life is, so far, our best example of how that can scale"
- "Molecular networks scaling into cells scaling into tissues scaling into organisms and beyond"
- Collective intelligence, goals... "biology is an excellent playground for these things"
- Cognition, mind etc. "All of these cognitive claims... where you think something is on the spectrum... how much mind... I don't think these are terms describing particular systems. I think these are terms describing our intended relationship to them... an engineering interaction protocol"
- Are humans machines? "If you have an orthopaedic surgeon who does not believe you are a machine - you are in trouble... If you have a spouse or a psycho-therapist who thinks you are a simple machine - you are also in trouble."
- The TAME approach "Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere"
- "Multiple observers can differ as to their assessment of any given system... but it doesn't mean that anything goes... observers can then compare 'how well did that worldview work out for you?'"
- E.g. Animism "there's a spirit in every rock"... how does that perspective work out for you? - what does it help you do?
- "The thing about treating these things as empirical questions not philosophy is that you are often surprised... that's what's good about science... an opportunity to learn"
- What tools to apply?: physics & simple engineering, cybernetics & control theory, behaviourism & learning, communication & psychoanalysis?
- Surprises: Very simple gene regulatory networks (no cell, no magic) - "that system, which most people would assume has zero cognition... is capable of 6 different kinds of learning including Pavlovian conditioning"

the best thing I hope my lab does on their best day is taking these ideas from Deep philosophy that people have
argued about for thousands of years and bringing them to the bedside to the clinic what you look like and where you
come from simply cannot be the foundation for how we're going to relate to each other but I don't feel in any
way diminished by the idea that there are an infinitude of other Minds highly diverse Minds um endless sensient forms
that are also having experiences that strive and suffer to various degrees I think what we have is essential I would
like Humanity to scale its cognitive capacity more specifically not just the intelligence but the radius of concern
of care and of of compassion I think we need to scale that up the amount of emails I get every day from people with
the most unbelievable examples of biomedical suffering is just incredible so I think it is utter moral cowardice
to focus on what we shouldn't do as opposed to our duty now that we have for the first time we have the ability to
actually rationally approach these matters to try to guarantee a better embodiment for essenti and beings on
[Music]
Earth cool well good morning Mike how are you good morning excellent thanks for having me yeah it's wonderful get to
Welcome
get the chance to talk to you I'm very much an amate in this field but I've admired your work for a long while and um I can't offer you the size of
audiences you're used to with your Ted Talk and with some of the other interviews you've given but I can trade
that for Quality because my audience might be small but they're lovely and deeply thoughtful so I'm sure they'll
appreciate your work and your thinking so it's great to have you here um and I think you're probably in nearly 200
episodes my first fullon biologists which is a gap I should have filled long
ago because there's this sense that you maybe the mathematicians look down on the messiness of Science and maybe even
the physicists look down on the mess of chemistry biology but I think the hierarchy goes the other way I think
biology is the the hard and more challenging space whereas the mathematicians and the physicists with
their spherical cows can abstract some of the interesting stuff away you you hopped your elbows in it quite often so
it's great to get the chance to have a biology focused conversation well thank you yeah I mean we we biologists have
plenty of spherical cows you know we a lot of people uh talk about some of our constructs as real you know Pathways and
things like this but you know of course these are all these are all imaginary kinds of constructs that we do our best
with so yeah cool um so this is a series of conversations about what I think of the deepest philosophical questions and
also the most important and they're questions of what's real really more epistemology than ontology you know how
should we go about best understanding this crazy world we all share but just as importantly the questions of ethics
and within that complex field the simple question of who gets to count who should we count as another as we're thinking
about how to lead a good life and I have an obvious bias because this sentientism worldview I'm trying to popularize and
develop is very pluralistic and very broad but in a sentence is evidence reason and compassion for all sentient
beings so when we're answering the what's real and how to understand the universe question it suggests a really broad humble naturalistic approach that
uses evidence and reasoning and when it comes to the ethical scope question the clue is in the name it says that all
sentient being any being that has the capacity to experience things to flourish to suffer should count at least
some minimal a moral consideration but I'm talking to people in this series of conversations some of whom agree and
some of whom don't so it'll be interesting to see how you have gone through your own philosophical journey and answering those questions where you
are now and how that runs through the work you do today but before we get on to those big questions how would you best introduce yourself for those people
in my audience who haven't come across your work SE up well let's see uh so my name is Mike Len I'm a professor at
Mike's Introduction
Tufts University I run the Allen Discovery Center here at Tufts I'm also the uh affiliate um uh faculty member at
the VIS Institute at Harvard um I do a number of other things uh I I co-direct
the icdo the the the institute for computer designed organisms with Josh
bongard um and um yeah that's that's me I study I study a range of things uh I
mean we we'll get into all the details but uh you know in my group here uh we we do a combination of uh biology or or
biophysics mostly um computer science and cognitive science to understand embodied Minds that's really what we do
yeah that's great thank you yeah we'll dig in we'll dig in so let's start with the first of these big philosophical questions the question of what's real
What's Real?
and epistemology quite often an interesting way into that space because it's so broad it covers you know anything we might choose to believe or
have credences in but an interesting way in many of my guests is to talk about their Journey with respect to religion
and spirituality and whether they grew up in a religious spiritual sort of context and household whether they held
on to those types of beliefs or or not and how that side of they're thinking about some of the sort of ultimate
questions of the nature of reality might have shifted since but so I don't know if you want to wind the clock back and
sort of tell tell us your story in that space and then we can get into I guess more of the field of science and so yeah
yeah um my background uh I think you could say is uh not religious but highly
spiritual so uh you know I went for for a few years I went to a to a a Hebrew
day school and um you know my my my background from that perspective is is Jewish and and and we you know we
studied uh some some some thoughts around uh around that that that whole thing uh you know and I and I harassed
everybody with questions about um what happens in conjoin twinning and how uh
you know how souls are supposed to work and how they solve the the the problems of you know the hard problem of
Consciousness and all that that that kind of a thing and you know those the answers weren't terribly forthcoming um
from from that direction but um in my in my home uh I think it was always very
clear from the time I was very young that uh we had an emphasis on uh on inquiry um on asking big questions on
making sure that uh whatever we spend energy on is uh towards things that matter in in in an ethical way you know
I was always encouraged to to find things um that I'm passionate about and to and to use uh intellect and and every
every other Tool uh at at my disposal to sort of get to the bottom of things so so we had we had lots of um lots of deep
conversations about um kind of the big questions and and how how they might be addressed you know the question how do
you know uh what figured prominently uh in my in my childhood um I was always
encouraged to think about those kinds of things so that in the way I'm describing that naturalistic epistemon of using
evidence and reason and sort of thinking things through in that inquiry was there from quite an early age even within a
family that sat within a broader sort of religiously defined community and culture I guess yeah yeah yeah I'm but
but but also to be clear that um you know there there are many ways of of uh
of enhancing wisdom or at least attempting to and so rationality is is
an amazing tool but but one can also ask questions about its limitations and what other Alternatives might be on offer and
you know uh making sure that we understand but what are the things that we're not seeing you know and and it's
sort of there's there's an old saying that says show show me the net with which you're fishing and I'll tell you what you're not with going to catch I
forget who who said it but that's you know that that um being having that level of skepticism about the approaches
you bring to a problem whether that be different kinds of logic or or whatever else you know that that was always
emphasized as well yeah and that and that if your if your choice of evidence or your choice of methods are too narrow
that can become its own Dogma as you say you've got to be able to question those you know those choices too and part of
the part of the way I try and counter that is to talk about evidence and reason in a very broad sense so some
people will think of that as being a narrowly rational or empiric or even a scientific process that you know doesn't
count as evidence until you've done a randomized control trial and I don't think of it in those terms at all I think of evidence and reason in a very
broad open sense that can include the experience from our senses our subjective experience and you know
however weird those might be I think those are all types of evidence too we can be skeptical of them but I think that broad conception of naturalism is
something I'm much more comfortable with than something that's really narrowly scientistic if you like which can yeah I
think narrow narrow down too too tily and and how how did that in sense of
inquiry but a broad sense of inquiry shift your actual beliefs over time did
even when you were asking the awkward questions did you still hold on to some of the supernatural beliefs anyway have
those shifted over time so I guess there's probably two linked questions that how do you think about the the
possibility of some of those Supernatural constructs now gods and souls and spirits and is your sense of
those still linked to this inquiry and a naturalistic approach or do you sort of Reserve certain areas of knowledge for
different epistemologies that might be more faith-based or revelatory yeah I mean I think that to
me to I I I I pretty much I think I pretty much only have one Supernatural belief which is that the universe is
understandable in some fashion whatever that may mean to be to be understood and that we are at least to some extent
capable of resonating with a fundamental principles that that guide its development and therefore knowledge
seeking and uh and things like this are not hopeless that that I fully admit is a supernatural belief because that's the
kind of thing you can't really um get behind but once once you've taken that on then uh everything else becomes
possible so I don't think anything I I can't think of anything that would be truly Supernatural in the sense that it
might be completely outside of current abilities to understand Maybe maybe Beyond current scientific formalisms but
also perhaps beyond our our cognitive capacities right so so all of us are finite beings guaranteed there are going
to be things that we are simply not capable of comprehending as well as we can comprehend other things and so beyond that uh I don't think anything is
is really Supernatural I think all of us uh are doing our best in um cobbling
together uh some kind of uh understand some kind of coherent understanding of the world and our place in it and then
the interesting empirical part is then you get to find out how well it's working for you so not just in the
narrow scientific sense of specific paradigms that help you do experiments and make predictions and things like that but the same idea apply to one's
life and so so you have various outlooks that you might take on various Frameworks and then you have to ask
yourself so so how how is this working out you know is this is this helping me have a more meaningful life is it
helping me um be a more more ethical person to have better relationship with others um you know those are the kinds
of things that are not specifically sort of scientific outcomes but the process is exactly the same you you examine your
Framing and you ask yourself could I are there ways to tune that framing to to to do better to have a better experience
with others yeah thank you I quite like describing this naturalistic approach as being just as an attempt to honestly
engage with reality and an attempt to understand it and that understanding will always be partial and probabilistic
and provisional and uncertain and open to revision but I guess that that's an interesting way of putting it it's
not just about you know does the evidence start with my hypothesis it's just it's also how does the application
of this knowledge or these beliefs actually work for me in Practical terms whether they're my life or engineering
context so yeah yeah thank you yeah it became it became pretty clear early on that how one looks at uh at the data or
at life or at anything else is a very strong determinant of how um one is
going to interpret everything that happens and and these kind of frames are they they drive what happens next and
they drive the kinds of uh the kinds of things that become possible for you or impossible you know they they determine
um what which things are facilitated and which things are are constrained and so that that aspect of it being really
being really um in control of of of how you interpret things I think I think is is is really important yeah thank you um
and if we narrow down now I think of I guess the scientific Pursuit as being a subset of naturalism the sort of a
formalized way of doing that and um your focus is in the field of biology and
it's been it's fascinating because I think for most people with their memory of the sort of high school sense of what
biology is involved in you've been taking the field in very different ways
although some of those different ways have quite old roots too how have you come to understand biology as a field WR
large and what are the sort of distinctive angles that you've been trying to develop particularly as you think about one of the you know
introductory comments on your lab's website talks about this fascination with the fact that all of us have gone
from matter to mind in some sense yeah uh I don't really think of myself as a
biologist uh I mean we certainly do biology in my in my lab um among among
other things but uh my uh fundamental commitment in my in my career and my
life basically has been to understand and bed mind so I've got this mind map that I print out every once you know I
refresh it and print it out every once in a while and it hangs in the in the lab and it's you know about 9 feet 9et wide this big kind of poster thing and
in the middle of it the the the root node of this mind map is uh is it says embodied mind that's really what I'm
interested in I'm interested in uh cognition intelligence uh and um inner
perspective in a wide range of diverse systems some of which we would call alive nowadays I actually spend very
little time uh figuring out a definition of Life although if you want we can we can talk about it but I don't I don't
worry about it too much at all I'm I'm interested in the things that all cognitive agents have in common I'm
interested in the scaling of Mind from its U most um sort of primitive and and
and humble examples in the in the in the world which I don't think anybody would call alive necessarily but I think I
think cognition is broader than life a broader category than life uh and um
yeah and that's and that's what we're interested in now now it just so happens that life is our best example of so far
of how that gets scaled so we do a lot of work in our lab using the the
phenomenon of molecular networks scaling into cells scaling into tissues scaling into organisms and and Beyond as an
example of how to understand collective intelligence how to communicate and ethically relate to those Collective
intelligences um where do the goals of those collective intelligence has come from and and so on so biology is a is a
is an excellent playground for these kinds of things things but I I actually think the the question is bigger than that yeah thank you and the again the
sort of high school and when I talk about it in the third person it's really my high school sense of these
things does reflect this sense that there are different scales of reality
and you're interestingly trying to span them and work across them and look at some phenomena that may be scale free in
some sense but I guess you can start you can think about the fundamentals of physics whether those are fields or you
know fluctuations in them representa as particles and you can come up through the different layers um for our purposes
I guess where it starts to get useful most people would think of life as being the point where you know we're getting
into the Realms of considering the possibility of mind at least there are entities that are separated from their
environment that have some sort of evolutionary history that have some form
of drive to live but You' hinted there already you don't necess find the
concept of life that interesting but then you can move through you know simple types of life in the early
evolutionary stages but also in their degree of complexity as well so in our current panoply of living beings you
know very simple single celled organisms plants and fungi and then it feels
intuitively like we take another step on the cognition path when we're starting to think about animals as well so as
we're as we're sort of working across that boundary from non-life to very simple life through to plants fungi and
the simplest animals where do you see this idea of
cognition emerging where did it come from and I guess what is it because one of the things I find interesting in at
least your public writing is that sometimes it does feel like there's a little bit of slippage in the term
because sometimes it cognition feels like something that's more narrow
computational you know it's something that maybe my spreadsheet on a laptop could be doing but sometimes there is an
implication of mind and a subjective perspective in the way you talk about
cognition as well so I should ask a better question than that but in that sort of space of simpler living
organisms how does cognition emerge and what do you think it is in its simplest
terms yeah so so here's here's how I think about these things the the
all all of these cognitive claims uh in other words uh where you think something is on the spectrum of cognition you know
how much mind and all of that I I don't think these are terms describing particular systems I think these are
terms describing our intended relationship to them so I don't think any of this is about the system itself
it's when you make a cognitive Claim about something you say it's this system is at the level of whatever what you're
really telling me is uh an engineering interaction protocol you're telling me what your viewpoint on that system is
and that Viewpoint is going to determine how you interact with it so I'll give you a simple example um people argue all
the time about whether whether humans are machines you know now now this is a long conversation because you have to Define machine you have to Define human
and all that but you know if if if you have an orthopedic surgeon who does not believe you are a machine you're in
trouble you need to you need to find a different orthopedic surgeon if you have a spouse or a psychotherapist who thinks
you're a simple machine you're also in trouble not not not a great not a great um fit there there are plenty of
supposed doctors out there you think you're a fluctuation in the cosmic Quantum wave vibrations so yeah yeah
yeah I mean so so so my framework so so I'm working on this framework called tame T technological approach to mind
everywhere and and and one of the main claims of this framework is that none of these things can be uh determined from a
philosophical armchair you can't just decide what things are you have to do experiments so if you think you know
you're a Quantum fluctuation whatever whatever that's that's great um it's all it's it's a it's a fine hypothesis what
has it done for you right like what what are the benefits and so and so I think this is this is the difference between
you know this kind of pluralistic view that I have where multiple observers can differ as to their assessment of Any
Given system that that's that's that's what I believe but it doesn't mean that anything goes because those observers
can then uh compare well how well did that worldview work out for you what has that enabled you to do what has that
enabled you to discover um how rich are your relationships with with the various systems given the view that you have so
so what you want to do is you want to get it right or at least optimize it you don't want to have false negatives where you attribute uh uh cognitive qualities
to systems that uh where where they don't give you any any new purchase so so for
example you know kind of um old school animist ideas where there's a spirit in every Rock it's a fine hypothesis what
how how's that worked out you know what does that do for you you know you need to do experiments you need to show that hey by saying that this thing has goals
it has learning capacity it has whatever this is now what I'm able to do I'm able to uh either either make better
prediction and control or we're having a more a richer exper you know interpersonal experience or something so
all of these things need to be empirically testable so in uh in in in
this framework your your spreadsheet may or may not be doing some of the things that uh are are tractable using the
tools of cognitive science for a spreadsheet probably not but but you'd be surpris the the the thing about the
thing about treating these things as empirical questions not philosophy is that you are often surprised which is
what is good about science is that when you re when you when you are surprised that that's an opportunity to learn and
so what I think all of these cognitive claims really are are hypothesis about which set of tools
am I going to apply so am I going to apply the tools of physics and simple engineering am I going to apply the tool
of cybernetics and control theory the tools of behaviorism and uh uh you know um um learning and training and things
like that or the tools of communication and ands you know psychoanalysis and love and and all these other things so
so so the thing is that when you when you treat that as a as an empirical question you get to do experiments and
you get to be surprised so for example um we have found that uh very simple
systems that represent Gene regulatory networks so just small numbers of of chemicals that turn each other on and
off that's it no cell no you know no no no um indeterminism no magic just just
differential equations of describing how how genes turn each other on and off that system which most people would
assume is has has zero cognition they would say well that's a very mechanical you know it's just as people say it's
just obeying the laws of physics and chemistry that that turns out there's a lot in that just yeah yeah right right I
hate I mean I I really hate that that that framing but that's what that's what people often say that system by itself
is capable of six different kinds of learning including pavlovian condition just there so with nothing else we've
also done uh We've also done work on sorting algorithms so these are extremely simple deterministic uh uh
fully transparent algorithms that people in computer science have been studying for I don't know 60 years or not or
longer things like bubble sword and so on even those things when you when you probe them the right way show novel
problem solving capacities and and behaviors that are not in the algorithm themselves so what I am taking from all
of this is that we really need a sense of humility about what things can do and
what um what kinds of tools are best appropriate for them you don't know we are we are not good at guessing we we
think we are and people assume this all the time but we're not good at guessing and so we need a mature science so this is you know if I had to pick one field
that I think I work in it's diverse intelligence research that's what I think we do we uh we are trying to develop principal Frameworks for really
knowing uh which kinds of cognitive uh tools which scale of tools are
appropriate for various systems and and and and we're just we're just not very good at at guessing from the beginning
yeah thank you and and intelligence I think I me again you can we could spend three hours talking about definitions of
it but I think many people would talk about it in simple times as being the capacity to solve problems which is
something that could be done with without mind and without subjectivity without feeling whereas
cognition or maybe again you're going to tell me that these distinctions are maybe not even
well well posed yeah so so let's let's okay let's let's break it down a little bit so so
intelligence I I I agree with you that a good definition of intelligence has to do with problem solving now I'm not
claiming that problem solving encompasses everything that's interesting about cognition there are play exploration there are other things
that are not about problem solving but but but problem solving is good because it's it's publicly observable it's a good scientific thing to study um and
and it's about uh competency in navigating some problem space you know and there are many many tools and tricks
that A system can use to navigate that um that problem space now now the thing about inner perspective is is is this
which is uh uh and and and I'm not at this point I'm not talking about uh the heart problem of Consciousness we can
sort of talk about that separately but but but but here's the thing about inner perspective uh it's not a binary I don't
think any of these categories are usefully binary what I think is important about inner perspective is this uh for for any kind of system you
want to be able to answer the question how important is the systems perspective onto the world for me to understand
what's happening so let's make a let's do have a simple example suppose you have a bowling ball on a on a hilly landscape so you've got this energy
landscape you got bumps and valleys and you got a bowling ball if you want to know what that bowling ball is going to do your view as a as a third-party
Observer to this as an external Observer your view of the landscape tells the whole story okay there's nothing more
you don't need anything else you you will have you will have everything you need to to know to predict what's going to happen from your external view of the
landscape by the way don't need to imagine what it's like to be the ball well that's the next well that's the
next step that's the next step which is that uh if you want to now know what a mouse is going to do on that landscape
your view of that landscape isn't really very interesting at all the important and it's not predictive of much the
important thing is the mouse's view of that landscape because if it has an internal representation of of of the
veillance of different portions of that landscape so rewards and punishments and which things are important to it and what attention it's paying and all that
the the inner landscape of the mouse is the actual landscape that's going to determine what happens next not your
view of the landscape so so different kinds of um systems have different
degrees of representation of their outside world it's not just brainy smart animals that do this all systems
represent the world to some extent and the question is how much the question is how much do I need to worry about uh and
and and one way to uh sort of quantify this is in terms of the size of their cognitive light cone so you can sort of
ask for any given system if you were to draw a A Spacetime it's sort of a butchering of minkowski SpaceTime cone
diagrams you can you can draw a little a little diagram that says what are the events both back in time and forward
because some systems anticipate so both back in time and forward in time and spatially what are the things you need
to know to to to have a really rich uh relationship with this system meaning meaning prediction control uh something
that benefit it's you and in some cases something that's you know ethical and all that um what what do you need to know so for a bowling ball the cognitive
lone is Tiny right because everything you need to know is right there you add up all the pushes and pulls on it you're
you're you're more or less done uh but once you start um entering the um
systems that are even as simple as a collection of genes regulating each other that's no longer satisfactory
because because they learn from experience and things that have happened before are going to make huge differences to what happens next you you
cannot G gain a full understanding of what's happening or or to gain good control without understanding their inner perspective so I think um inner
perspective uh is uh is is something that to some degree is wider than biology I think what biology is really
good at is scaling up these cognitive lyones so you know in a rock the cognitive lyone of the pieces which by
the way is not zero it's very small but it but I don't think it's zero uh is not really summed up in the Rock You Know
The Rock has exactly the same level of cognitive lyone as its pieces but biology super good at to say it another
way I think we call by we call living things any system that's good at scaling up the cognitive lie of its parts it's
going to look alive to us you know and and and just a final kind of thing which you know we'll probably get to again
later um in terms of uh what kind of world we want to live in I think that evolution is has no Monopoly on
producing in cognition in other words up until now yes that's probably at least on Earth that's probably mostly where
cognition came from is from the from the fun of of of of mutation of selection and of some other some other things but
uh I don't think intrinsically that's that's that's where cognition has to come from I don't see any reason
whatsoever why the um rational efforts of other cognitive agents such as ourselves couldn't make new minds U you
know going forward yeah thank you yeah we're good to dig into that and the point you mentioned about the um the
approach to genetics is one of the things that you've helped to radicalize this view you know this simplistic view
that DNA is some form of blueprint where you programmatically and linearly follow it that's one of the things I as I
understand your workers radically opened up it's nowhere near that simple it's much more about you know systems
interacting and memory can be held in different forms and so on so yeah it's
broadened down that view and as we're sort of moving further
up the scale if there is such a scale one of the things I've heard you
resist before as you are here in a way is this idea of really clear binary
Concepts Concepts like sentience and Consciousness that try to take ideas
like cognition and map them onto this intuitive sense that we have that we are
ineffable distinct somehow unique entities that feel like we're SE
diff separate we're not just physics and and um I I am with that resistance
because I think there's a danger in that intuition that we I that we that we
rify these ideas because they're obviously important to us intuitively I can understand why anyone's
Consciousness would be important to them ultimately it's all their experience right and everything we experience comes through the Consciousness but there's a danger in reifying that we take it away
from just being physics because ultimately I think I share your view that you know just physics we are all
just part of the natural world all the way down it doesn't mean these aren't interesting Concepts but they're not distinct from physical reality
um but at the same time I prefer not to put them completely to one side and I
think in the way you're describing you know needing some sort of research
concept or some concept of relationality can still provide you know
at least a couple of reasons why it's important to still focus on ideas like sentience and Consciousness and I guess
one it came partly through my conversation with Mark SS who I know you spent a lot of quality time with I've
Loved some of your discussions because part of the way he tells the story about
evolution is that sentience the capacity to actually experience AV veillance is
one of the things that's probably driven the process of of of you know broader cognition and evolution in the first
place so he puts that concept of or the ability to feel things feel good feel
good bad how am I doing now in this environment as as quite Central I guess that's the way I think of sentience as
being just that capacity to have an experience and to Value it from yourself whatever yourself is but I guess another
reason another potential research project links to our next question which is that these things also seem to have
some quite deep moral or ethical significant too in that you know and
we'll come come back to that but I guess those are two of the reasons why those sometimes problematic Concepts and I
certainly don't think they're binary in any sense there's still a drive for us
to understand and and and dig in so what do you think about those sorts of challenges about you know is is there a
because because you could go to a point of view where you never talk about sentience and Consciousness or
subjective experience in in those Senses at all and you stick purely with a more
neutral description of cognition and agent spaces and Mark of
blanket do you feel an that there is some meaningful pull to
delve into and better understand those ideas of sentience and Consciousness in their own right or how do you think well
I I think those are those are essential um my uh my resistance to Binary categories is not uh to um you know uh
kind of reduce these these aspects that you're talking about at all it's to uh
on the contrary it's to have a better understanding of them and their potential you know I I get a lot of push
back from both directions so I get mechanistic you know sort of supposedly reductionist scientists who say well
this is crazy you're you're you're you're you know your your painting feelings onto onto cells and chemistry
is the best is the is the best kind of explanation you know and that's not really reduction is because then if you
say well you mean quantum foam you want to talk about quantum foam they say no no no that's that's that's not it it's chemistry it's got to be chemistry
so so so so they've picked they've picked the level okay uh but but I also but I also get a lot of flack from the
organists which and I consider myself in the organicist tradition but but who say look by putting um non-living things
such as uh physical objects and computers and whatnot on that somewhere on that Spectrum you're uh undermining
this uh this this this battle that we've had for hundreds of years to preserve the the the magic and the and the
importance of of of life and of inner perspective and so on I I don't think understanding these things better and
understanding how they scale up reduces the importance or or the Majesty of the obvious uh sensient of of living living
beings I think uh much like with any kind of science it helps us to understand what we are and what our
potential is and what we need to do I think that um this this this weird obsession with with chemistry and with
and with physics too is uh is is is is what um undermines the efforts to really
understand this I'll give you a simple example um well two examples one is uh I
often I often hear people say this uh that's not real you know real um goals
real uh preferences real veilance real anything that's just uh it's just
following the laws of physics and chemistry well guess what if you you know if you if if you were to zoom in to
your brain or the rest of your body guess what you would find you wouldn't find fairies you would find physics and
chemistry so so it's if you found fairies they'd be following the laws of physics too they would have to be following something right so so I'm not
against if you have a model of you know people sometimes email me but what about the soul I say bring it on if you've got
a mo if you've got a model of the Soul explain how that works and how that
solves these problems and and we're good to go the problem is I've never seen such a model but the you know the
question I I always bring it back to uh the parium you know or or a simp single cell do you or do you not believe that
that thing has to to some small extent a preference about what happens if you if
you do then we are then we simply point out that well look it's it's very
clearly made of of of a set of interacting chemicals at some point we'll be able to reconstitute one so
what's the what's the issue if you don't then you have to explain to me what happens in embryonic development where
you actually go very slowly and and and um gradually from a single cell into
whatever it is that that we are and again there is no magic lightning flash that converts the chemistry of the oite
into the mind of of of the of the of the adult human so this continuity you you
can't escape it what we owe is not a story about magic bright lines we owe a story about scaling and the other the
other uh thing that I think is is really curious and um it's kind of um I don't know if it's my if it's my upbringing uh
with with too much science fiction or what but I I find it really amazing there was a there was a great scene in um there's a movie called exmachina you
know uh yeah and and there's a great scene in that movie where the protagonist is is now so confused by
this by this AI that he's been dealing with that he's standing there in front of a mirror and he starts cutting his hand because his arm because he wants to
see if he is a robot too right and it's very important to him it's this is this is this is critical to you know to him
he's you know it's very stressful um and I get emails all the time also from people who say I I've I've I've read
your paper I understand now that I'm I'm a walking bag of cells now I'm depressed I don't know what to do with myself this
is this is terrible right and and then mean just let's let's just unpack this this cutting your arm thing so what that
means is if you were to find you so so you cut open your arm and you find a bunch of cogs and gears you've had you
know I don't know 40 50 however many years of experience in your own skin be being an agent exerting effort towards
uh various outcomes and having moral quandaries and and and having you know qua and all these things and when you
see those cogs and gears what you're going to decide is none of that was real
because I am committed to the idea that cogs and gears can't support it this is this is so bizarre to me and it's
bizarre because we don't know what cogs and gears can and can't support you know why why are you so so attached to uh
protoplasm and proteins and whatever else uh you know is inside you over over what something else that you might find
what do you think you know about those things that overrides your primary experience as a human it's just it's
it's amazing to me that that what people naturally tend to say is okay well then
I guess I'm not real I'm not important I can't do all of the amazing things I was going to do versus wow I guess I just
learned something great about cogs and gears look at that uh you know I guess cogs and gears can do it not not too
much more shocking than finding out that proteins and you know and and and carbohydrates and whatever else is in our bodies can do it yeah and neurons
firing it's like yeah yeah but but but but people are so committed to to simple
to well to two things to to to first of all to the idea that if you if your
parts obey the laws of physics then then you are somehow reduced which I think you know this this allegiance to the to
a low level of description I think it's completely arbitrary Dennis Noble does a really nice job um in his work on uh
against privileged levels of causation and things like that uh and and then the idea that uh that we know what various
kinds of materials and architectures can do we have we have absolutely no idea you know we need this this this actual
field is at a despite the rest of science is at a very um stage we we do not know there are
emerging not just emerging complexity so so so everybody studies emerging complexity that's been around for a long time it's not emerging complexity here
it's it's emergent goal directedness and emerging cognition and that happens in even in very simple systems it surprises
us constantly we are not good at predicting it we are not good at creating it yet uh well I should say we
may create it un unwittingly all the time and so people who say you know I know what this is because I made it I I
I think that's a that's a really dangerous idea because because you don't know what something is just because you made it or because um people say this a
general language models or whatever just because you know the parts that went into it we do not yet know what it is
what it can do and and how important is the inner perspective and what kind of inner perspective it has so um yeah I
think I I think a lot of a lot of humility here is needed and a letting go of this idea that the right level of
description is chemistry and you know I think it's it's it's fine that that's there it does not tell the whole story
in any practical way yeah thank you you need to understand these things run and operate at different levels and
interlocking levels yeah well well just just you know very specifically uh the
business of uh the business of physics and determinism right one of the key issues here is that determinism is well
and good if what you're interested in doing is looking backwards so something has happened and you're going to tell a
mechanistic story of why it happened and you can always do that that's always on the table so you zoom down and you say look this person did that because these
neurotransmitters zigged and zagged and and they did that because of the electron forces and and all of this this
stuff right you you can always tell a story going backwards but that isn't what we're interested in both as as
humans and scientists we're interested in going forwards as in what can and should I do next and what can I invent
or how can I um increase my understanding next and that is a completely different kind of task so so
here's here's one of my favorite examples um uh the game of life cellular automatone right so you've got three
simple rules that dictate uh how each the state of each cell is going to be on or off based on what its neighbors do
okay so just a simple two-dimensional grid isn't it with completely simple Y super simple two two-dimensional grid
the cells are on or off uh and and it's it's fully deterministic okay there's not even any stochasticity here so so so
every cell in every tick of the clock each each cell becomes you know on or off based on how many neighbors it has
that's it now now now we know and if you if anybody in the audience hasn't seen it look it up um and and you can see
these amazing things that happen right so emerging complexity is very strong here and if anyone hasn't played with it I'd recommend go and find some of the
online tools because you can play with this stuff yourself yeah it's mindblowing yeah ABS absolutely absolutely amazing and and and so now so
now look you can imagine being a a reductionist determinist about this world and saying so so for example one
of the things that happens in this world is there are things called gliders so gliders are patterns that are a
particular shape and the shape moves across now to be clear nothing actually moves across the cells are just turning
on and off but the pattern itself it's like a wave in you know the pattern itself moves and those those are called
gliders so now you could be a reductionist about this and you can say look there are no gliders all there is
are the individual cells and I can tell you precisely which cells are going to come on and off and the fact that you think you see gliders is an epip
phenomenon it it does nothing in the system there are no gliders all it is is is the rules and that isn't exactly
wrong because the physics of the world are quite clear but it's absolutely limiting in the following way if you
don't believe in gliders you can you can predict the next state of whatever state
I set up in the game you can tell me exactly what's going to happen next there's no escape from that level of determinism but here's what you won't
ever do you won't ever build a touring machine made out of gliders as somebody did somebody designed a pattern that
does computations by sending gliders back and forth if you don't believe in gliders you're not going to do that it
closes off that level of inventiveness so looking so so so a key thing about
these these higher levels is that they enable you to have a more a richer richer relationship with the system going forward not just explain what
happens backwards after somebody's done the interesting work of preparing a system for you yeah it's fascinating and
and the idea of a universal touring machine is is a essentially a computer
that can carry out any computation you know given enough time and enough resources so and this is from Individual
sales blinking on and off based on a super simple rule set clicking for time
and and the other and and I don't know if this is right but I like the difference between this idea of
determinism looking backwards and looking forwards because in a sense it's the same deterministic mechanism going
forwards yeah but for it to be useful we need to actually short cut whatever that deterministic computation is going to be
for us to be able to predict and to do that we need to understand pans at different levels and sometimes we can't
do it um you know sometimes the thing is computationally IR reducible such that
the only way of finding out what's going to happen is to let the process run or to create a simulation that's so perfect
you basically just duplicated reality right so so so even if it's conceptually deterministic in the future that doesn't
necessarily help you anticipate and and the idea of these high level Concepts as you said give you useful tools in your
relation to these phenomena to you know anticipate maybe the future and understand the past yeah yeah and and
and control what happens next so so as a simple and some of these systems the cool thing about living and other kinds
of systems of this type is that they offer this kind of shortcut so so here's
a simple example imagine that you had a rat and you wanted him to do a simple circus trick you know I don't know sit
on a little bicycle or something one thing that you might do from the level of chemistry and physics is you might say okay so I want the muscles to move
in this particular way I need to calculate which neuronal impulses are going to move exactly these muscles to do it I need to trace it back into the
brain figure out all the circuits how how everything is um propagate through the brain and figure out which pixels on
the retina I need to stimulate with various images you know shown to the r to get him to get on the little bicycle
okay if you try to actually Cal so so that's completely computationally intractable if you try to do that the
you know the sun will burn out long before you actually get it done but but but there's an amazing thing here which
is that you can just train the rat and that's because the rat has a particular cognitive causal architecture that hides
all that stuff and it takes on all the complexity of figuring out how should my internal parts be uh uh arranged in
order for meaning meaning all the different neurotransmitters and everything else how should that all be arranged in order to achieve a
particular goal so the way you do this is you get the buyin of the Rat you make your goal the rat's goal and then the
rat does all the uh the hard work for you you don't have to calculate all this stuff forward so one of the things that
understanding these um the large scale capabilities of your of your system is critical in having a productive uh
interaction a predictive powerful productive interaction going forward and this is something that I think is the
rate limiting step right now for regenerative medicine because in in biology and and and and biomedicine the
standard operating assumption is that cells are mechanical agents all the excitement is about the hardware so so
crisper genomic re you know genomic editing pathway rewiring everything is down to the level of hardware and that
closes off a huge number of potentially really powerful interventions like which
things that we're doing in our lab like cellular training um exploiting cellular problem solving because if you insist on
uh viewing systems from that low-level perspective not not that it's wrong it's I mean that perspective is there it's
there for you to take but it limits you you know reductionism is well named it reduces what you can do it reduces your
ability to really exploit what's what's what's what's powerful about these systems and we are leaving so much on
the table by uh refusing to test out the tools uh the interaction tools that we
have and and that have been used for you know this this is why humans trained at dogs and horses for thousands of years
knowing zero Neuroscience right it's because it's because it's because these systems make it uh accessible make make
that that whole process you know the goal rewriting process so accessible they offer that beautiful interface that
learning interface so cells and tissues do this too and and if you refuse to to test those hypotheses you leave a lot on
the table yeah thank you so these ideas of sentience and Consciousness are very
important to you still they're not things you discard but you refuse to say they're binary they're not on or off
switches if there are boundaries they're fuzzy and in your sense they may not even be a boundary at all ultimately may
just be a question of degree across every possible system but that doesn't destroy their meaningfulness because
there's a sense I think with some people who have a very expansive view of Consciousness that they either
rify it in some sense you know they again they pull it away from the physical and you know that can lead
people into again back into some sort of mystical or soul-based ways of thinking about it or they declare it
Universal as some might say you're do because you're saying well it's it's a spectrum and there's no real end to the
Spectrum so in a sense maybe everything shares in these characteristics to some degree um but by declaring it Universal
they almost destroy what's meaningful about the concept yeah and it sort of flattens
flattens out and I don't think you're doing either because you're you're recognizing that while you don't want it to make it binary there's still
something distinctive that you can describe in terms of how how we relate to these entities and and what these
these Concepts can help us understand about these entities so it retains their meaning yeah it it doesn't just it
doesn't just it's not just for explaining it is essential for it is essential and useful my my claim is that
I ideas about uh cognitive capacities in unfamiliar contexts and unfamiliar
embodiments are essential they're practical and they're essential this is this is uh this is not um philosophy
it's not um you know some kind of feel-good mysticism my my claim is and it's it's a testable claim that we've
been testing for now for for 20 years successfully is that uh it it helps you
do better in in the empirical world I mean my the the best thing I hope my lab
does is uh what what what I you know on on their best day what I think we're doing is taking these ideas from Deep
philosophy that people have argued about for thousands of years and bringing them to the bedside to the clinic and and and
these things these ideas are empirically essential to get the kind of outcomes that you want so so that's you I don't
know what more what more um we can say about why these why these ideas are real because by taking that inner perspective
by asking what do cells remember what do they care about what what is their the size of their goals what are their goals
these are questions that lead directly to Therapeutics they lead to work in regenerative medicine in cancer um I
don't I you know I don't know what more evidence we could have that these are that these things are critical and the other issue is that this this idea that
if we if we let if if we start to apply the tools that we use with cognitive
systems we try to apply them elsewhere that that that that kind of leads to some sort of sliding creep that um
devalues our own uh cognition and and our own Majesty uh that that's a weird
um Zero Sum game that I don't buy into I I am in no way diminished by I don't
feel in any way diminished by the idea that there are uh basically an
infinitude of other Minds highly diverse Minds um endless sensient forms throughout the Universe I think but
certainly here on Earth that are also having experiences that that that strive and suffer and to to various degrees I
don't think that diminishes us at all it's it's to to me it it seems childish to me to to to somehow pin pin our um
the quality of what we have on the fact that no one else has it that that just seems I I don't know why we need to make
that move I think I think I I think what we have is essential I think understanding it is essential so that we
can scale it up I would like to scale my cognitive capacity I would like Humanity to scale its cognitive capacity more
specifically not just the intelligence but the um but the the radius of concern of care you know um and of of compassion
I think we need to scale that up and you only do that if you understand what it is that you're scaling you've done the perfect segue into our second big
What and Who Matters?
question about the ethics and what I might do is collapse these questions of what matters and who matters just into
one because in the big questions of Ethics in a sense there are there are a bunch of different choices you could you
take a nihilist route where you sort of give up on the idea you could take a relativist approach where you think
about ethics as just uh set rules that groups have negotiated in a more
transactional relational sense but there's no real truth of the matter about whether those rules do good or bad
you could follow a Divine command Theory going back to our early conversation where you could turn to the the Bible or
the Quran or some other source of Supernatural Authority and go basically following those rules or being obedient
to that deity is the ultimate harbit of what's good or bad but if we put those aside and personally I think we should
whatever sort of moral philosophy we have whether it's about rights and day
onology or whether it's about consequences on utilitarianism whether it's about feminist care ethic where we
have relations of care whether it's about virtues you know whatever the system is they do all seem to share a
sort of Common Sense ethical core which is that somehow morality is about whether and how we care about others
and the obvious question then is okay well who gets to count as other that's really our who matters question um and
again I and this podcast have a bias because we tend to focus on this idea of sentience as being the qualifier in that
for an entity to count as another they need to have their own
perspective within which they value their own experiences States interests
uh and lives I guess and because they value those things themselves that's the
rationale for us also caring about them because in a way if morality is about caring about others let's care about all
of the others that have their own perspective and so qualify as others so it's almost a little bit circular but
anyway that's that's I guess this the starting point from a Centric ethic is to care about all of those others but
I'd be really interested in your own thinking about either the the sort of foundations of Ethics right wrong and
good and bad but also given what we've talked about so far how you think about
moral scope and who gets to count and what are the implications of that and what what Journey have you gone on
through your life so far and thinking about those big questions yeah well uh you know it's
it's somewhat beyond my pig rade to try to lay out a global uh theory of of
ethics for everybody else and so on that's I won't try to do that but but I will I will give you some thoughts and and and how I think about um these
things uh couple things first first I think it's it's important to um not
pretend that once we understand how sensient something is we are
automatically good at treating it ethically okay so so we know that's not the case we you know fact factory
farming you we all know we all know pigs are are um pigs value their own their
experience that they feel pain all that and yet here we are so so so I think what we know and and how we treat them
are not unfortunately the same thing but but but certainly um we should we should
have a a principled way of um apportioning uh our relationships with
with other with other beings of all different kinds I think that uh moving
forward in in uh in assuming assuming we all you know survive the next few
decades I think moving forward for for the flourishing of humanity of ecosystems of other beings on Earth
really requires uh the Deep lessons of diverse intelligence I think we need to
understand that there is no such thing as a magical standard human that is the
the the subject of all these you know philosophical arguments F first of all because because evolutionarily we have a
lineage going back to single cells so anything that you think about human UH
responsibilities whatever well how about a human of 200,000 years ago how about 500,000 years ago you know where where
was it right where how did it get here and so on uh so all of those things are uh continua the same thing is true of
embryonic development you can ask how these things showed up from in your journey from from an oite to to a being
and uh all of the um uh the current discussions of neuroatypical humans and
uh you know the bodily modifications that some people do these things are going to be laughable to the to the
humans of the next couple Generations in their in their minor sort of um degree
this their timid degree I mean you're you're going to have humans that are so modified in body in mind you know
cyborgs hbrs with various biological and technological changes that it's going to
be completely obvious you know right now we're we're we're kind of lulled into a well we have been for for for centuries
lulled into a false sense of security in the sense that it was easy you know before you could say does it speak if it
speaks then it's it's like us and even and even that Humanity failed you know we we've we we were really terrible to
each other for for much more much smaller differences but but but you could you know you could say um where
did you come from meaning were you evolved or did you come from a factory and you could sort of knock on something and if you hear a metallic clanging
sound you say okay now we we know we know how we're going to deal with this and if and if you heard that know some kind of soft um kind of thud than that's
something else that those categories were never any good but they served us kind of okay for a long time those are
gone those are those are gone now they're going to be left in the Dust by the next couple of a couple of decades
it's going to be essential that we learn to have an ethical um I call it synbiosis with other beings that are
nowhere with us on the tree of life they are modified in body and mind and what you look like and where you come from
simply cannot be the foundation for how we're going to relate to each other and again science fiction dealt with this a
long time ago um uh but but but somehow uh people today um have have lost sight
of some of those things you know again the current debates over AI it's very easy to say that language models aren't
this and aren't that and and I'm not a defender of any particular view of sentients and language models although
more generally I don't believe we really know what we have once we've made it but but but but the thing is those kind of
language models they're so different from us that it's very easy for people to say Ah that's not that's that's
that's not the things we want to care about what are you going to do when you're confronted with humans that have you know 51% of their brain replaced by
by various silicon appliances and uh and and and you know they're they're linked together with other people and also a
few a few AIS and some things like that so all of this is coming uh it is um we
we we are going to have to develop um a more better better more principled ethical Frameworks for for dealing with
it with with beings that are just very alien uh you know in in their construction and so that means that you
need Frameworks to understand what's in what what do all these beings have in common and this is something that a few
years ago I I developed this notion of a cognitive lonee to try to get away from
the idea of of what kind of material embodiment you're in and instead focus on what are the things you care about
what's the what is the size of the biggest goals you can um you can uh you
can pursue and regardless of your of your embodiment or implementation or origin story and that kind of a thing at
least begins to uh give us a a way to to apportion uh our degree of moral concern
to beings that are capable of um pursuing goals and uh and and having you
know various kinds of uh competen of navigating um problem spaces and and and suffering when those goals are not are
not made are not are not reached so that that for for for that reason uh I think
um you know I I think I think the the diversity of what we who and what we think counts is going to be enormous and
and this business of language models and and so on it's just it's a distraction from a much much deeper puzzle yeah
thank you and one of my previous guests Josh gallis has done quite a lot of work in that space about think about
potential artificial intelligences and sentien and so on and actually he's quite challenging about the idea of
sentience because he's worried that it's seen too much as a sort of easily isolatable property that we will then
deny to for example artificial intelligence and robots and so on and he prefers a much more relational approach
which we can go back and forward about the risks and the challenges of that but one thing I do agree with him and I
think you is that we're going to be forced into working this stuff out whether we like it or or up and it I
think it will open up and radicalize the way we think about what it is to be other and and and that need to
appreciate radically different perspective from different beings but but I'm I was really glad you mentioned
animal agriculture because one of the frustrations with many people who are involved in sentientism or a worldview
is that there's a frustration in the current Z guys that people seem really excited about talking about artificial
intelligences an artificial sentien and whether robots could ever feel something and become moral patience but people
seem to conveniently skip over the hundreds of billions if not trillions if we include aquatic non-human sentient
beings will be brutally exploit today and it's and it's a really interesting case study
because I think when you take a naturalistic epistemology and you
understand the facts of what farming and fishing are like not just factory farming but all of it and you take the
ethical perspective of the beings that are going through those processes it quite easily leads you to a point of a
quite extreme ethical condemnation of what's going on in those situations but our society has trained us to think
they're so normal that there's a a brutal clash between you know if you
like the epistemology and the Centric ethic and today's social norms I was I was thank you for for mentioning that I
I mean a so so a couple a couple of things there one is that um yeah I mean you're absolutely right of course uh in
in uh uh in talking about um these AIS uh and instead of the problems with the
with the existing life forms is is is a huge issue it also comes up when people say oh wow we're you know we're going to
make these highlevel intelligences and who knows how they'll be raised and what they're going to do in the future I mean
you've heard of having kids right like like I'm I'm just you know we do this all the time we we have an enormous
amount of guaranteed highlevel intelligences that are created all the time in a huge diversity of of good and
and bad um environments that there raised in we have a very limited um ability to make sure that they they have
a good embodied experience and are aligned with our values and some of them go on to do wonderful things and some of
them go on to you know to to do horrible things that's already an issue we we we already have that the thing with um so
so these in many in many ways these problems are not new problems brought on by AI they're perennial um existential
problems that Humanity has F has faced forever you know in terms of being supplanted by the Next Generation that
finds your value you know relevant and how much control do you want over how your neighbor is
raising their kids and all these kinds of things this is this is um this has been with us with us for the longest
time the one the one unique thing about uh about um AI intelligence is though is
that they can be copied in a much easier fashion they can be reproduced and copied in a much easier fashion than
than real animals and I think that um now now while there are some good uh I
the debates about whether something that actually can be copied even counts in this case so you know um there's there's
a few arguments that that that's not an issue but but but but I'm not sure yet and I think that for that for that
reason because there's just going to be such an uncountable number of intelligences uh of the software variety
whether embodied or not it's something that we need to we need to consider you know and and I'm hopeful that uh with
the Advent of different different ways to grow um food proteins and so on we're going to eventually completely just you
know do away with with animal farming and so on but the creation of Novel um
synthetic organisms is is only going to increase and I mean you know digital or embodied or not so so that's you know I
I I think we need to we need to focus on both sides of both sides of that equation yeah I agree agree um and I
don't know if you've your thinking on that has led you down the path of boycotting animal Agriculture and its product so far or whether I can help you
offline on that path but yeah yes why why don't we why don't we talk offline sounds good sounds good so the other
ethical question I wanted to touch on with you is how that bears on your own work in the lab because you do work with
a variety of different entities animal and non how does that play in because you're into your choices because you're
working with some very simple organisms and you're working with more complex organisms as well that would have richer experiences how how do you think about
that again I won't take you through it in depth but I'm interested in sort of simple perspective you take they come
animals in research yeah yeah um well uh first just to say that animal use and
research is incredibly uh stringently regulated so so so in order to do the things that somebody would do when they
go fishing for an afternoon we have three months of paperwork and and oversight by by veterinarians and
ethicists and all that so so so there is there's a huge amount of oversight as there you know as there should be I'm I'm in full favor of that um but this is
this is something I think that's that's really important and it gets to this issue of of of what matters um a lot of
folks see scientific ethics in the following way everything's great and you
scientists better not screw it up right so so so here's a long list of things we don't want you to do uh we don't want
this we don't want that uh don't make things worse now that could I suppose
could have been a viable worldview when people believe that our current world is
in some way set up uh in the right way for us in other words it is the best possible world everything is great now
now don't screw it up what we now know is that that that that's not the world
we live in we we we are the process of a Meandering evolutionary uh path
Evolution does as far as I can tell does not optimize for any of our values it doesn't optimize for happiness for
intelligence for any of that stuff no we are where Evolution dumped us with all of our ridiculous susceptibilities to
bacteria viruses lower back pain you know stray cosmic rays that might have hit a DNA molecule um during development
and now you know your potential is radically limited when you broaden that Scout scope out to all of the potentially sentient beings that it just
becomes even stalker right if there is some t- Los to this universe it's a pretty brutal one yeah it it it is it is
there's no doubt and so I I'm not even a clinician but the amount of emails I get every day from people with the most
unbelievable examples of of biomedical suffering is just is just incredible so
I think it is utter moral cowardice to focus on what we shouldn't do um and uh
and as as opposed to our duty now that we have for the first time I guess on Earth we have the um the ability to
actually rationally approach these matters to try to uh to try to guarantee
a better uh embodiment for for essenti and beings on Earth um the you know the
number of people that are suffering because of our ignorance because we don't know what to do and also because of our um our timidity and our and our
um um our unwillingness to take responsibility for we are the ones that
are now uh it is on us now to uh to to improve this for people um and and and
not just people for ecosystems for for other beings for uh just just the the amount of the amount of ignorance and
inaction that are that is letting uh sensient being suffer worldwide is is incredible and so I think that uh I I
take I take animal use ethics extremely seriously but I think to the extent that it is our responsibility to relieve the
suffering worldwide science has to go on and we have to do experiments that are going to enable us to improve embodied
exp experience for for for all um this is uh just uh you
know the Buddhists have this have this concept of an inauspicious birth and it's this idea that that in one of your
many lifetimes you're born in a body during which you just can't make progress towards you know towards
Enlightenment I I think at this point I know this is this is a a controversial view but I think basically right now
every birth is an inauspicious birth all of us are are limited by the vagaries of
of random mutation and selection and all these dumb things and viruses all these dumb things that have no one's best
interest and I think in the future I I I sort of sometimes I sort of imagine this dialogue that uh you know uh children uh
in the future are going to have with their teachers you know you know the kind of thing where where you tell the kids yeah we wrote on chalkboards know
and we didn't have uh cell phones and like what you know and and so so they're going to say you you're telling me you
would just have to stay in whatever body you randomly got and if you had some sort of defect you just have to live
that way and if you're you know and and if and if the IQ and the lifespan that you were born with wasn't enough to fulfill your goals that that's it you
just had to you know that was your bad luck that's that will be Unthinkable to to a modern uh you know modern uh humans
going forward and in a way that's that's a beautiful link into the final question which is how do we make a better future
Follow Michael
which is what you know what are the promises of these types of research and and thinking but yeah I mean I I think
uh ultimately from the kind of the bigger picture for me is is freedom of embodiment I think that every sensan
being should have the and and we need to we we should we should offer assistance in the same way that we offer assistance
to beings via education via uh you know support of every every of of every kind
we should be in a position to offer the ability for tion beings to have better
uh embodiments to fulfill their their potential their goals and so on practically speaking what that uh
requires is um complete control over growth and form it means that we need to
really be able to uh direct what it is that cells build now right now that just
looks like regenerative medicine in the sense that if we knew how to get cells to build specific anatomical structures
then birth defects traumatic injuries cancer aging degenerative disease these things would would would go away if we
could communicate our goals to groups of cells and and this is something that we and some other labs are working on now
is is this kind of you know this this idea of an anatomical compiler where you can just specify the shape of the of the
structure that you want and it gives stimuli to cells to to make them grow exactly that and again linking Ling to
what you said before this is different from the classical ideas of genetic engineering or you know what you do with
chrisopher and S and this is a different mode of Engagement with a a system yeah
the go the goal is is similar because because certainly people uh you know uh at the time that genetics was getting
off the ground this is a vision that people had then too that if we understood the genetics we could control the shape I I I think we have a much
more um practical path to it because I think the genetics specifies the hardware that every cell gets to have so
the the proteins but uh as we know from from the Advan advances of computer
science and information technology programming at the level of Hardware while possible it's really hard and if
you have good Hardware that's actually reprogrammable and offers high level interfaces you know you might say apis
which I think is exactly what what it offers then then you can do this in a much better way specifically by uh
honoring uh the agency of the cells and tissues and being a collaborator with them we we we don't we don't micromanage
our cells and tissues here um in my group we we basically collaborate with them and and and modulate their goals
and take advantage of their competency their problem solving capacities their memories and so on so I think I think
that's that is a way uh to move the field forward much faster I think that crisper and those kinds of things are
going to flatten out soon because because after you've picked the lwh hanging fruit of single Gene diseases
the next question is going to be well what genes do you edit to make the changes the anatomical changes you want and it's and development is not
reversible in that way you can't just you can't just figure out what uh any easy way what what to edit so uh I I
think uh taking advantage of the of the um interfaces that cells use to hack each other is is is critical but
initially that just looks like reprogramming tumors and regrowing Limbs and um growing new organs and so on all
of which by the way we've done here in in various model model systems but ultimately it leads to freedom of
embodiment it means that if you want to have a different embodiment you can and if you decide you want to change it you
should be able to do that too there is there is no reason any of us should be stuck in uh in the embodiment that we
that we got including including IQ and lifespan and all those all those things uh because those things were not chosen
with your welfare in mind they were they were the a long process shaped by forces that don't
honor any of our values yeah thank you it's quite quite a vision and we link to
some of the themes I've touched on with some of the um people who are interested in the transhumanist space like David Pierce and so on as well and again it's
that freedom of embodiment for human and nonhumans sentent beings that is to put
it a different way shaped by their own values and aspirations and experiences
rather than constrained by inherited biology and and freeing from some of
those constraints but some of my audience will love that sort of vision
and see the potential others will be nervous about classic problem of human
huis and intervening where we're not really ready to intervene what do you think of the risk profile of the approach you're taking are are there
risks we need to watch out for the we need to build in for sure there are
going to be risks but but I'm pushing in the very opposite direction of of the of
the huis I my argument isn't that uh everything is great and then in an
effort to um make it even better we're going to screw things up and and we may
screw some things up it's pretty pretty inevitable my my argument is that things are so bad right now for so many that it
is a moral uh imperative we we do not have the luxxury of saying
don't do this uh wait action is a choice too right yeah exactly right the the
opportunity cost of doing nothing is is is massive um it's absolutely massive
and you know uh this this this idea that uh that that you know we don't have to
do anything because we can let let things go um how how they are now that that's that's simply not acceptable that
that that that that opportunity cost is is is too huge so so yes we're going to make um we're going to make mistakes but
anybody who uh you know we know from our personal lives if if if if the thing that you are most optimizing is to never
make a mistake what what's going to be the value of of of your life and all the you know all the the huffing and puffing
you know that we do during our life our our brief time here uh what What's the goal you know if if that's I mean
obviously you want to minimize making mistakes but but there should be a constructive I I believe there should be a constructive element to this where you
have a you have a purpose to elevate uh and and help others and that is not going to happen by focusing on the um on
the things we shouldn't do and just just just more broadly I I I ask you know people who focus on this like negative
uh kind of risk risk-based perspective what what does Humanity look like a hundred years from now are we still are
we still getting lower back pain and bad knees and and dying into our 80s once we've gotten this you know a little bit
of wisdom under our belts like that's it and and you know and and if you happen to uh you know some some some cosmic ray
or something hits hits one of your chromosomes then are we still living like that I mean I can't imagine I I
just that that that would seem such like such a waste of this Incredible Gift of of intelligence and compassion that we
have that uh it seems ludicrous to me but but anybody I I think I think people should spend time painting the future
that they do want you know um everybody's already P you know written down all the things they don't want that's fine now now paint me a picture
of what what do you want what where should we be 100 years from now yeah thank you I'm a sucker for a bit of utopian thinking I know you're a fellow
sci-fi fan as well and some people will use that as a way of discarding some of the ideas you're working on and saying
it's just sci-fi but I think sci-fi's got a lot to teach us I often find better philosophy in in sci-fi than I do
in actual philosophy and one of the things about sci-fi is it's very good at sort of intuitive sentien starts because
it's so common and just natural and even unthinking and most science fiction stories to recognize the salience of
sentient beings that are radically different from ourselves and I think there's a lesson there we can take too so yeah for sure and you know sci-fi to
me if if somebody says uh this is just sci-fi my question is very simple are you saying it's impossible or are you
just saying it's going to take a while like that's there are certain things that may be I don't know what those would be but there are certain things that may be physically impossible fine
everything else is just a Time T then we're just quibbling over a timetable every everything that's possible is
going to be done and there's dystopia in sci-fi but there's also utopian sci-fi so yeah like I say paint paint those
pictures well it's been an inspirational conversation thank you so much for talking to me today Mike what's the best
way of people following you finding out more about your work I'll include links in the show notes of course but where would you where's the main place you
point people yeah the official uh Lab website that has all of the kind of peer-reviewed um hard stuff is Dr
mel.org one word drmike 11.org the more speculative uh you know the photography
the pros and all that stuff and so just some thoughts that I wouldn't you know I wouldn't put in a scientific paper is at
um thoughts. lifee it's a Blog called thought life and I'm on Twitter at drr1
yeah that's awesome thank you and I'll follow up with some vegan tips offline so cool that would be great I appreciate
it all right well thank you so much for being a guest on sentientism it's been a pleasure Mike take care enjoy the rest of your day appreciate it thank you you
too please stay in touch
