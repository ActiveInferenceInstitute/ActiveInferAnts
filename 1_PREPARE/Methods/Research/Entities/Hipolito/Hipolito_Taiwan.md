Inês Hipólito on Cognition under the Free Energy Principle at the University of Taiwan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aS5rXFs6Hw

after I have it includes another layer or another level if you will
um to understand the mind so it includes uh the environment the frequency
principle talks about uh or invites in a coupling between an organism and an
environment and I'm gonna of course talk about this in more detail uh because the talk is about the free energy principle
not about these are the two uh theories but so that we do a little bit of tidying up the house and layer of the
land it is important to see where the furniture principle differs from these other two uh theories so there's this
quite recent book for everyone that is not acquainted with the free energy principle is quite accessible and I
would recommend it and the view it's precisely that there are more layers uh that the financial principle allows
because it takes um the organism to be coupled with the environment and because
of another reason that I'm going to mention which is that it applies a skill free
um tool which is Mark of blankets which allows us to Define um or to ask which
um level of scientific interest we want to study or module or predict and then
it allows us to apply that Markov blanket either in the brain in relation to the body or the body in relation to
the environment okay so having um set that literature uh and situated
the 300 principle in the philosophy of Mind contemporary literature now I
wanted to take you into the two roads um there are slightly different because
they start from two very different premises and um you can choose uh a little bit like
as we say uh pick your poison kind of uh kind of thing you can choose which one you think that makes most sense
um to understand the mind and cognition but there are these two different ways um that I wanted to take you take you on
so it really comes down to these um graph and I'm really happy that the
authors in this book included this graph I find it extremely uh useful to understand what Carl had in mind when he
talked about these two rows the high road and the low road so I'm gonna just I'm going to be taking
you um over this graph from one way and from the other way
um so I'm going to start with the low roads to active inference and
the low road which I'm just gonna go back to show you the low roads starts
from the bottom left corner and that's where we're going to be starting and it
starts right here and it would go the argument to take this road would go
something like this if brains do not have access to the world they must infer
it brains do not have access to the world brains are then predictive machines they
must infer it so you see here the similar similarity um where we are in the literature we are
very much siding and starting off with helmholes the predictive machine
so here we are in a low row to active inference and the idea is that of course we start
with the base theorem and we start with a very known framework
to study the brain that we know of which is predictive coding so we do that in order to then go up the
road through generative models predictive coding is used and then we
arrive at a conclusion that leads us to think or defend that the brain is
literally a predictive machine the brain is a Bayesian brain so that would be the
low row to active inference and this is very much developed in papers such as
does predictive coding have a future that would be taking the low road to active inference or for example the
neural coding framework for learning generative models that would be another example of the low row to active
inference recent advances in application of predictive coding and active inference models within clinical
neuroscience so this would be one way of doing it and note that this kind of literature that
takes uh this road is usually um the one that is conducted in
Neuroscience especially by using and employing Bayesian predictive toolkits
and models in order to understand the brain network activity
and then we arrive at the high road to active inference which if I may say it's
a tiny bit more philosophical and might be
um more interesting for philosophers to think about and discuss
so the high road to active inference is an argument that it's slightly different and fourth was first this can also be
very interesting how you have a road map that allows you to arrive at exactly the
same uh place but coming from different arguments so I found that quite interesting for flows first to think
about so the high road to active inference argument the way that I laid it out would go something like this if
organisms do not want to dissipate they must engage in active inference
organisms do not want to dissipate therefore organisms engage or can be
described as if they were engaging in active inference so this is the simplest
form of putting um the the high road to active inference
the way that I see it so this means that
um not only this argument is quite different has got it starts with a completely different premise from the
low row to active inference but um interestingly it tells us something
it tells us that starting off with the free energy Principle as opposed to
starting off with predictive coding or base inference
um it's it means that this road uh is taking a first principles approach so
what it is doing is um it is looking at the world observing the natural world and
um and identifying a pattern and this is what I find interesting philosophically
from the point of view of the high road it starts by identifying a pattern in
the natural world and what is that pattern well when we observe um agents or organisms behaving in the
environment there's one pattern that is common to all of them however we find them whatever they might be doing they
will be engaging it's very likely that they will be engaging in activities that
will be conducive to them maintaining their existence so they will be engaging
in activities that are seeking um states that are preferable to their
own Survival and adaptation so what you get here is you start off
with the observation of the natural world and you create a principle with the low road on the other hand you
start off with computational models applying those computational models to the brain and then making an ontological
Claim about the brain on the basis of the model so the structures of thinking
are quite different and I just wanted to highlight here how different they are
okay so it's a first principle approach um to understanding cognition and the
engagement and adaptation of organisms to their specific environments
um the free energy principle states that organisms must maintain their existence so this is the observation is that they
must maintain their existence and here is where things start becoming quite interesting engaging
um and uh inspiring I I would say so the idea is that to survive any
living organism has to maintain itself in a suitable set of preferred States
while avoiding other these preferred states of the environment and this is
right here what makes the 300 principle a first principles approach because it
starts off with the an observation that becomes a principle right because of the
observation of a pattern in the environment so then we need to do the final k for
each particular individual each particular organism we needs to Define okay it's very nice and well to say that
they must maintain themselves in a suitable set of preferred States and avoiding these preferred States right
but then how do we Define those for each particular individual what are going to be the preferred States for a particular
organism who are going to be this preferred States for uh that particular individual as well all right so then we
need to do a little bit of a theory building precisely for that so preferred States interestingly are going to be
defined by Niche specific evolutionary adaptations so
um that means that there is one side of it um that is going to that's going to
genetically and evolutionary processes uh thrown in the mix are going to Define
what is going to be preferred for a specific individual for example uh a
preferred state for fish that is defined by Niche specific evolutionary
adaptations is that it would prefer to be in water
they'll be preferred state then uh what is interesting um from the free energy principle is
that it not only defines preferred States from evolutionary adaptations but also allows for extending those
preferred states to learn cognitive goals so also to untogeny and also to
the developmental side of the interaction with the environment this means that the the more organisms are
going to interact with the environment the more they're going to learn how to interact with the environment and what
states are going to be preferable to their specific existence and existence
within a specific State of Affairs now we'll add this preferred States well
this preferred States in here is where everything starts coming becoming super interesting that this preferred states
are the states are surprising to that particular individual right and the the
the the the most extreme form of surprising to that particular individual
is the one or that state that translates into a phase transition that is death
for the organism so again um however we find in the organisms in
the environment behaving and engaging with the environment we know at least
these two things that they will be seeking preferred States and they will
be avoiding these preferred States the avoidance of these these preferred States is the avoidance of states that
are or that come with high surprise or high uncertainty to the organism
so they must avoid these surprising states which means that
um the way that they behave in the environment is going to be striking that
balance between preferred and non-preferred states and that is going
to be where the minimization of free energy becomes quite useful uh from a
computational perspective because the minimization of the free energy allows precisely to computationally
solve that problem as we study a specific level of of um of um of life
um that is interesting for us to understand
in these hard roads onto active info
and that and and note how we are doing this only by simply observing the
natural world right uh so the unique imperative is that minimizing the
surprise uh is that living beings are minimizing the surprise of their sensory observations however we find them they
are minimizing the surprise of their sensory observations and here it's
important to note that surprise is taken in the technical uh sense uh what is
surprise is uh for a fish uh being outside of the water that is a very
surprising state for for for a system uh that is a fish because that will
eventually mean that the fish will eventually dissipate right so then
behavior in living beings is going to be precisely these striking this balance
between preferred sensory observations and the current sensory observations and
then of course acting upon the world to make this uh um compatible
or match okay so then let's talk about what is this minimizing of surprise right
um this minimizing of surprise is not something that can be done passively
right as we observe the environment so let's say that a certain living system
finds itself in a very surprising situation so one situation that puts
their um existence at risk right they cannot
um uh minimize the surprise of that particular State simply by passively
observing the environment but they must adaptively control their
action perception Loops in order to seek those preferred States
and this is precisely where the active bit from active inference comes from
right and I thought that these um this quote here it's an interview that Carl
gave a little while ago and I thought it was quite interesting to illustrate precisely what he has in mind with his
High Roads to um active inference it says in this interview you thought I'm
going to read it in in full because it's quite quite interesting if you subscribe to the premise that creatures like you
and me act to minimize their expected free energy then we act to reduce
expected surprise or more simply resolve uncertainty so what's the first thing
that we would do on entering a dark room we would turn on the lights
why because this action has epistemic affordance you know in other words it
resolves uncertainty or expected free energy the simple argument generalizes our
inferences about heathen or latent states of of the world that the
contingencies that underwrite those State of Affairs and the contingencies
that underwrite those states of Affairs and what strikes me as most interesting thing in this passage is the notion of
epistemic affordance right we navigate the world precisely behaving in ways
that are epistemic affordances such that we minimize surprise so states that are
very um harming or not suitable to our particular goals and existence
um and that means that those are that behavior is behavior there is resolving
uncertainty right and bringing out more clarity
okay so then that means that we are now um in um the particular blue road to
active inference we are now talking about the surprise minimization right
we already talked about uh living systems and how uh they interact and
engage with the environment uh in ways that they want to or they seek to minimize uh surprise now we're going to
move into uh uh the what what I already introduced introduced as a very
important um tool in the financial principle which is the notion of Marco blankets which I
take that um everybody is very much familiarized with um active inference offers uh also it
claims that it offers a solution to precisely understand how the organisms
are behaving in the world as as minimizing of a surprise or a surprise
minimizers right so this way the mark of blanket will
come very very handy because the question then is okay I'll buy into it uh I will buy this idea that
our living beings are behaving in the environment such that they are minimizing surprise such that they
maintain their existence but then how do we delineate the dependencies between
the adoptive system itself and an environment that is continuously
changing so in other words the question is how do we delineate the statistical
dependencies within this coupling that is this
organism and the Very Niche that it is engaging with so how do we delineate
that coupling such that we can understand the reciprocal influences between one another as free energy
minimization so um the idea starts off with the view
that these organisms are that are adaptive systems that are adapting to a
continuously changing environments these organisms are on the one hand they are autonomous
right and what that means is that they self-organize in ways that they can be
differentiated from um their environment in a certain way so
even though they are interacting with the environment it is possible to statistically uh differentiate uh what
is organism and what is environment okay that's what being autonomous but also
being in a precarious situation means and here this is quite developed in
um the autopries theory by uh Varela and matrana if you want to have a check on
that if you have not done so so without this autonomy uh um without which it
would simply dissipate so if there was not at least some form of boundary in or
within the organism that is the that is defined by the the rules of self-organization then the system would
simply dissolve and simply do not exist right
uh it would be continuous entirely continuous with um
environmental Dynamics in the absence of this separation there would be absolutely no surprise to
minimize because there would be no system that is trying to engage with the
environment in a certain way and that certain way is precisely remain alive so
there would be no need for surprises for minimizing surprise so because that's not the case the case
is that we do have a precariously autonomous system that is interacting with the environment precisely to
maintain itself alive to if you will to defy the second law of Thermodynamics
that open systems are should tend towards chaos or increase of entropy
leaving the system self-organized precisely by engaging with the environment to defy that law so then um
Marco blankets are going to be very a very important tool to precisely understand the boundary around those
systems and how um the boundary is set up in relation to
the reciprocal influences between internal States and external States so the mark of linkage set the conditions
for the present event or the present State or the present State of Affairs and they also allow us to predict a
future State given the present conditions given what we know about present conditions so the markup
blankets are this formal way to express a separation and the coupling both a
separation and the coupling between the system and the environment that the
system is situated at which is what makes it so interesting is that this is
a boundary that this should be seen as an epistemic boundary as opposed to an ontological boundary but if you want to
say anything about ontology you can you can say that well this is a boundary
that is set up and flexible um towards um the relation or by the relations
between the influence the reciprocal influences between internal and external
States okay so then uh the free energy principle uh minimization as well as
this tool as a mark of blankets like I said it is skill free which means that it can be applied
um to um any level of self-organization and it's quite relevant because it for
for for for a system to be autonomous precariously precariously autonomous it is a system that's self-organizes so to
have a level of self-organization it is possible to apply these kind of tool and I'm not going to go in detail in any of
that but I am but I do want to at least gesture to the applications where it has
been developed so for example my colleagues and I we have um applied Markov like blankets to different scales
of the brain such that we applied it to understand um the Dynamics and reciprocal
influences of synaptic um Dynamics um such as uh what this graph that you
can see on the left side um um synaptic Dynamics as well as cortical
micro circuitry uh we also applied it there to understand if it would make
sense to explain it in these particular ways and we also applied it to
um networks of regions within the brain it was very very simple the question was
if we apply this sort of understanding of Markov blankets to different levels
of the brain given the data that we have will we find the brain following such
rules and is it possible to explain it through these mathematical formulation and what we found was that it was
possible to explain it in different levels of the brain it then was um developed in these other
people paper parcels and particles um it's quite interesting but it is a
very um linked a long paper and I'll just gesture to it um we also applied it uh in a more
philosophical way to uh this other work where we think about
um phenotypic representations uh in organisms
okay so then um it is also possible to apply this particular formalism to
cognitive processes and in here you can find work for example in social cognition applying uh
this particular markovlinket style to a social cognition
um and an Adaptive agent Behavior as well uh where of how this kind of work
for example in applying it to a preventive mental health care
there you go as the influences between the organism and an organism that is situated in a smart environment
also it has been applied to understand plant cognition which is a form of
minimal cognition where you have precisely the same kind of formulation where
um here what happens is the plant is seen as internal States and the environment is seen as external States
and then because internal and external states are conditionally independent
that means that reciprocal influences between the plant and the environment are
occurring at the exchange hopefully a balanced exchange between sensory States
and active States if during the Q a you would like me to go over
um the explanation of this particular formulation graph I'm I'm happy to
so then we arrive at predictive processing and we are most there um in active inference right so then uh what
we have here is um a formulation of um active inference sorry a formulation
of um what I've just uh mentioned uh with all of these studies
um in a way that you can um now think about the free energy principle and organism self-organizing
in the environment um uh that with in in the formulation of
a principle that they do not want to perish they want to maintain their own existence and for that reason you apply
a Markov blanket and now you can start understanding the behavior from a
mathematical perspective as predictive processing so as as we are now arriving
in our hybrid to active inference so then what you think it well the way
that you you look at it is that you have um this um this graph which is very well
known to anybody that is working in active inference or the free energy principle but for those who are not very
acquainted with it uh I'll just very very briefly uh go over it so what you
have is uh as a scientist you define your level of scientific interest or your object of a scientific interest and
once you define that um you will see you'll Define uh that particular object as the internal States and then because
you are after understanding what are the reciprocal reciprocal influences between
that particular object of scientific or state of scientific interest and the
environment because remember that state or object is what it is in relation and
because it is situated in an environment it is not encapsulated from the environment right so if you want to do
any ontology that would be the direction for the ontology um for for philosophy of Mind people in
the room um so um then you define that phenomenon of scientific interest as internal
States and then of course uh external states are going to be the local Niche
that immediately from a statistical point of view influences whatever the
state the internal state is going to be at right but because they are
conditionally independent that means that internal States and external states do not directly influence one another
mathematically stipulated they will indirectly influence one
another by virtue of the mark of blankets and what is inside the markup
blanket is sensory States and active States and internal States so it is uh
actually the activity between these three states sensory active and internal
states that is going to influence that is going to make this reciprocal
influences between external and internal States which I put in another way internal
states are going to depend on sensory States and active States
so this is the sort of the active inference graph that everybody in the
literature is very much acquainted with um I could unfold a little bit more but
I don't think it's necessary because now I just want to now add the predictive processing layer and explain the the
same graph in terms of arriving now to predictive processing so in very uh simple terms this simply means that
sensory states are going to correspond to predicted prediction error and active states are going to correspond to
prediction so the internal states of a system um are going to issue a prediction in
the form of active States and then those active states are going to be updated or
the prediction is going to be updated by the sensory States or by the prediction
era so that would be the mapping of the active inference and
um reading of predictive processing um in active in front in an active
inference kind of like scheme okay and then we arrive at self-evidencing
um and here what um we arrived at is uh precisely
um the the argument that we have already mentioned which is if organisms do not
want to dissipate they must engage in active inference organisms do not want
to dissipate organisms engage or can be described as if they would be engaging
in active inference depending on whether you take a realist or an instrumentalist approach to active inference and
financial principle right and self-evidencing it's
um a concept that of course has been around and it can be seen in different ways depending on which field or which
uh system of thing of thought you are most familiarized or indoors or defend right so it can be seen
um as reinforcement learning uh or it can be seen for example as a minimum redundancy free energy principle can be
seen as self-organization or it can be seen an as Bayesian brain so what the point is that there is a translational
way of understanding this software or evidencing uh thing that um of systems
and organisms in different um mathematical languages
um or even theoretical approaches okay so self-efficiency means that organisms
that finding a particle or a creature that we will be likely to find a creature in a particular state that is
minimizing surprise and that corresponds to the maximum rising of the value of
the particle or the creature state and these states have highly uh that have
high probability and are by definition attracting States and this would then connect to complexity or dynamical
systems theory and this is consistent then with the Bayesian brain hypothesis and predictive
coding by helmholtz which then allows us to arrive closer to the Bayesian brain
right you see the trajectory that we are doing here but it also allows us to engage with uh right here with
autopriesis and Niche construction that I have mentioned have been developed by matarana and varel and many other people
now today mostly known as inactivism um so what you get from taking the high
roads to to the to active inference is that precisely that it allows you to
um it's philosophically more interesting but it also allows you to then engage
either two words the patient brain or more towards more autopreezes more
complexity oriented Theory um or partnership with the free energy principle
okay so recap uh what we did was uh we looked at uh we did a little bit of like
literature review understanding the State of Affairs about predictive processing theories of cognition and it
happens many times that they come very conflated and they seem that they're uh very much pretty much the same or saying
the same um well while there is Nuance most of them would agree with the idea that
which is conclusion to the argument that I laid out for you cognition or knowledge is inference
and then we looked at the two roads to active inference the low road from the
low road you start off with a premise that brains are predictive machines in
the high road you start off with the premise that organisms engage or can be
described as active inference conclusion okay so as to conclusion you
have you can choose to take either way right depending on which one you think it's most reasonable or most useful for
a particular scientific problem or for the answer a particularly a particular philosophical puzzle right so once you
take um the low row to active inference you take cognition as neural activity right so it's most likely that you are
closer to the view of applying predictive coding to uh neurodynamics to
understand causal relations um so it's most likely that you are in
that particular field and it is very much compatible with computationalism in
philosophy of mind and it is also very much compatible with scientific realism so the literal sense in which the brain
is literally a predictive machine it's not the view that uh there is a model
and the model allows us by using the model to say some things about how or to
understand some causalities in the brain here um taking the low road it is most likely in the literature that people are
aligned with scientific realism if you take the hydro then you have different possibilities so um
the high road takes a broader account of cognition so cognition is taken as cognitive adaptation to the environment
so the philosophical question is how do living systems adapt to the environments
how do living systems seemingly defy the second law of Thermodynamics for example
and these particular Road would allow you to be more compatible or closer to
either so here you can develop either two theories uh from the philosophical point of view you can either take a
theory that takes computationalism and realism so to say that living beings
adapt to the environment by literally engaging with or applying or employing
active inference so that's computationalism unrealism that's a possibility another possibility is one
that is much closer to contemporary e-cognitive science so embodied in
active ecological cognition um and that is the view that not uh
organisms are not computers they are biologic biological systems right and
um in this particular way then you would take a it's much much more likely that
you would take an instrumentalist view by saying that um free energy principle and active
inference models are extremely useful to understand the observed behavior of
living systems as cognitive but that does not necessarily is the case that
while they are adjusting the organism or adjusting to the environment that they are themselves employing and applying uh
equations of free energy principle or active inference so these are the
different options in the philosophy of mind field and this is this is me thank
you so much for your attention and I'm very much looking forward to your thoughts
can you turn off your mic yes
yeah thank you so much for the presentation and um I actually came across some materials on the free energy
principle but this talk is still very helpful and it fits all those pieces in a very nice way and help me it's very
helpful to me so Tom Yin Can you please give your comments and I will ring the
bell when eight minutes has passed because you only have 10 minutes okay okay thank you so much can I share my
screen hello I know maybe in this you have to stop
sharing your screen thank you okay one moment
okay can you see my PowerPoints right now yes fantastic okay so let me begin uh
uh sorry I actually can't Okay so
let me see uh hold on hold on I can see it in this you can't see it right
I cannot see it I think on the right hand right hand side the upper corner
you you can see a few modes of viewing
um Skype and I think you have to choose the right modes of viewing Skype in order to see the shared power points can
you see it it's a on your top right hand corner there are a few choices and you
have to choose the right choice which one is it because I've got I've got a view or or change scene
actually I'm not sure if I'm not using the English version okay I I have it now I'm so sorry go on
please okay you you have seen it right okay yes okay oh wonderful uh fantastic uh uh
yeah uh let me begin with uh in traditional introduction to myself uh my name is Tong Ying I'm from uh Institute
of philosophy Chinese Academy of Sciences um uh thank you for inviting me for this
commentary and uh any thanks to uh Dr hippolito this is
a wonderful talk I learned a lot um so uh I have been working on free
energy principle for a while but not like privately and secretly but I have
been thinking this about this issue for a while and so it's uh I really like how Dr
hippolito uh qualifies what those two rules to it to active influence mean
because when I read the chapter uh from the book to uh there is
um about two different the high road and low water acting inference we discussed
how what makes the difference between these two rules alas
so this talk really clarifies a lot and still I have several questions uh I'm
pretty sure everyone will be very interested in how there
could be two different I mean high and low roles to active influence and I'm pretty sure a lot of participants would
like to ask questions of how active influence can explain mental activities and how or how biological systems
interact with the environments but what really catches my attention
um lies in these two words as if because
this is from because this is more generally about the debate between realism and anti-realism
so uh one conclusion from uh data hippolytosis slides is the organisms
engage or can be described as if in an active influence and an instrumentalist reading suggests
that the free energy principle or fep along with active influence do not describe an actual mechanisms or
processes that implements active influence to minimize free energy instead they are useful tools
that it can be used to explain understand or model the internal activities of organisms and their
interactions with the world and I also consult a data ipolito's
recent Publications I found that she seems to suggest this reading her recent works if I'm correct
okay now this really reminds me of one
philosophical Topic in my research this is vnm representational theorem ensures
that the theorem says that if an agent is preference to satisfy certain structural accidents she can be
mathematically described as as if again maximizing expected utility well in addition a linear strategist
theorem proves that the agent's decision can be represented as if using a unique probability function these theorems
provide a mathematical framework that can explain prediction agent's decision future actions
and because it really strikes me a resemblance I suspect that fep and and
active influence are similar in the same way they are complex mathematical and
formal models that describe living organisms or agents as if inactive
influence so I I found this resemblances to be very interesting
okay and what's more these theorems do not make any clients about how the mind
works it is possible very possible that agents do not use utility or probability
functions at all in their decision-making processes rather these are just simple these are just models
or tools that we can use to Modern agent's belief and preferences based on
their uh publicly observable behaviors so also results
some philosophers argue that this theorems representational theorems do
not explain how agents actually reason it's not about their how their mental uh
how they uh uh go how they go through when they make
decisions but what's normative rationality requires so some argue that
well actually the these formal models they're just they are actually trying to
model an ideal rational agents not actual agents okay so the target is
different and in addition the explanatory power of the ethereum lies
in their front work because it is just a formal results or mathematical results that we can represent the agents as
maximizing expect utility with a unique probability function so here's my question there's a concern
that fep and active influence aim to explain how the mind actually works not an ideal agent works so greater than
mathematically proving what organisms should normally normatively do
so if we interpret fap in active influence of mathematical instruments how can we generalize from what
organisms should theoretically do like representational theorems to what their
empiricals are like what agents actually going through in their plan or I don't
know biological within their biological systems okay so this is my first questions
my second question is how successful because traditionally instrumentalists
interpret descriptions of unobservables and theories are merely instruments for predicting observables okay so it's
there's a requirements behind instrumentalism that those theories there are instruments because they can
be used or employed to predict future observations of empirical phenomena for
instance Newton's prediction of title phenomenon marked his theories empirically successful because at the
time no other Theory predicted it so there's a novel prediction is uh at a
time while fep and uh with active influence provide unified and useful framework for
explaining life or biological systems or company science it is unclear whether
there is any empirical evidence confirming that they successfully predict the activity I mean future
activity of living organisms I mean they their theories fep and a and active
influence I believe that they do quite amazing working explaining a lot of mental
phenomenons but I'm not sure about whether they make any future or predicts any future activities or of living
organisms so here's question it might be argued as
a VP with Equity influence currently lack predictive power necessary to be
considered instrumental tools in the same sense as Newton Theory okay and
this is my final question so let's take a step back okay the debates between scientific
realism and anti-realism traditionally focus on the Natural Sciences in general not not about the
specific science just in general okay so this tend to be a very general question so the question is debates revolve
around no mirror for example numerical arguments the pessimistic induction on
infrasal basis explanation and other relative issues so
sometimes I'm wondering what's the motivation for adopting a realist or instrumentalist interpretation of AVP
and active influence because they seem to be questions for philosophy science
in general not a question for specific spatial science okay so what's the
benefit and what we can learn from this does this resolve any issue or fix any problems in any contribution any
progress does it bring about any epistemic significance could this just be a merely a
metaphysical question so maybe so just wondering what can we learn and what's
the motivation so if we want to interpret or classify
fvp with active influence as realism or instrumentalism okay I think these are
just three of my questions thanks
um thank you so much for the very interesting question so uh it stimulates
my Force too so inex can you give some quick response in three minutes so we
have again we have a restrict time limit so can you give some quick response in three minutes
because you've made such good points uh there can be uh there will be the Q a
time and you can discuss further okay okay good um so I I try to take notes
but of course um it is it is uh difficult to keep up with such Rich uh three questions
um so from memory uh I'll just say that it's important to keep in mind uh scales
right I saw that there was a very quick step which we usually do um in philosophy of mine I think which
is um the step of we are talking about um uh organismal systems say like cells
or neurons or brains like organs and then all of a sudden we immediately start talking about the level of agency
right so we need to differentiate these levels and that's what makes it so relevant to whether or not you're that's
what's going to be the differential in how whether whether you should take instrumentalism or realism because you
can say well um scientists or even uh fully formed agents like us schooled and educated
with mathematics can engage in model based reasoning to deliberate about a
decision that they want to make in the future right and not necessarily using
Bayesian inference but you can use a certain kind of like inference to reason about um something in the future uh real
estate would say that well uh neurons literally do that as well because what
you're doing is by um by by virtue of employing these scientific realism move
then what you're doing is attributing full agent capacities to neurons that
are connecting to one another so that's one differential just to think and be alert and think about whether we want to
go one path or another whether we want to pursue one argument as opposed to another one why is philosophy why is RVP
relevant uh to this discussion or why should we be discussing that uh within philosophy of science that's a very
simple reason it's because the fvp can and has been mostly applied to cognition
but not only that you as you very well noticed these relation and I really
appreciate the first relation point that you made with Von Von Neumann who by the way I really really like his work
um and as you very well see um the fep doesn't apply uh to cognition
uh the fep applies to anything that is a self-organizing system so anything that is a complex system you can apply so
anything that is an open system that is exchanging information or energy or matter with the environment you can
apply the free energy principle I am not saying that you should I am not saying that this is the theory that is going to
uh be the unifying Theory I did not make that argument I am just simply saying
that that is why fep can be relevant within also philosophy of science not
only philosophy of mine and this is what I would say for now as with my three minutes
what okay okay thank you continue
okay yeah
you should stop sharing your screen again okay
confirm and we have Lee Chen Cho from Shanghai
University yeah uh could you see my sorry
no I want to share my screen also has the
same problem I have seen your screen but there's nothing on your screen
yeah maybe the Sims I just I'm just seeing your desktop here
oh maybe I just uh uh let me do this
could you see it's a slice just a desktop no slide
just an empty desktop with some flowers
and tree a tree yes it is beautiful
now it's a black screen yeah
are you still here
B10 yeah come hear me I I can see you and
hear you now but I I there's just a black screen here
the really weird it's yeah apart your desktop again
okay let me see how to do that
um
sheer
uh maybe you could ask things this life to you and help me share the screen
yes peace students yeah yeah I send you through the email
right
but it depends on the size of the attachment it might take a while oh yeah
yeah yeah oh sorry really sorry okay I just don't know I
cannot see actually I cannot see where my slice when I try to share
can you try to shade in the chat box
yeah yeah sure
[Music]
okay let me do it
oh really sorry
how you say it uh in the chat box or yeah in the chat
box not yet and I I still haven't received your email
oh okay sorry
so do you have co-ops on your PowerPoints I use the Keynote
do you have squats on your in your PowerPoint uh no
if you don't have graphs so maybe you can just copy your text into the text box and do your presentation first
so yeah yeah sure and now I think I should could just
oh I could just use
the the chat books you know I I just begin my comments yeah
okay okay sorry for for the technical problem and thank you very much for this very
clear and insightful lecture on active inference actually I read this active
influence book uh with doing maybe twice I can't remember that and my comments
will focus on this unification part you know the the free energy
principle excise us it is provides with a promising picture one simple rule to
roll them all in all I mean all the phenomena of live cognition mind and the
image of meta a sentence from the active offices of
behavior and recognition in living organisms follow a unique imperative
minimizing the surprise of their sensory observations
so it it seems that suppose we call strong continuity between life and the
mind uh I found actually I found the two papers work on this part so what is
um a continuity since it's strong continuity between life and mind
the things is uh the the synthesis of a strong continuity it was first proposed
by Peter got the first Miss in 1995 it is present life and mind have a common
abstract pattern or set of organizational properties the functional
properties characteristic of Mind are enriched version of functional properties send a fundamental to life in
general mind is literally life like
so uh I I think uh the fep means suppose
is a continuity since it's strong Community senses uh here I adjusted
formulated this simple argument
so we have promised why if there is a common pattern between life and mind and
the painting is fundamental to both life and mind then life is strongly
continuous with mind promise to F fep is
a common pattern between life and mind a promise 3 at
sorry fep is fundamental property characteristic of both life and mind
therefore life is strongly continuous with mind so here I will focus on what's
in common what what is SCP so I think there are two ways we can
challenge this strong continuity by fep
the the first we we challenge is a strong continuity by SB isn't life and
mind do not have any common pattern despite of some superficial similarities
uh the second way is that the current pattern is fundamental to life but not
to mind all the common painting is fundamental to mind but not to life my
comment will focus on uh uh the first week so what's in common
so it seems that it is possible to use the same set of
formula to characterize activities of life and or bring the set of formula has
same meaning no matter where it is applied to therefore the set of formulas
stands for common patterns life and bring have a common pattern so I will
argue that in the premise too may not be true therefore the argument for
I will use examples from information Theory uh as we know that Shannon's
mathematical theory of information has the same form
uh have has the same form with the birdsman's formulation of the second law
of uh thermodynamics I I just sent the two formula to the
chat box this is for information entropy and this is for some more Dynamic
entropy they do have the same form there's two formulas
so also information entropy and the simple dynamic intravision as common
formula they are different actually they're different
so I I just uh uh cite a sentence from Terence Deacons work
is a deacon says consent the analog to the simodynamic entropy breaks down however
when we consider the additional entropy does not generally increase
spontaneously in most communication systems and there is no equivalent to
the second law of Thermodynamics when it comes to the entropy of information
so I tried to show that maybe the same formula when we applied it to different
fields it may have different meanings so here
I'm not seeing that I'm not seeing then there's no connection between
information and simultaneous entropy actually I believe that there are some
deep connection but not in this superficial way
two minutes left okay just uh I will finish it yeah at
the same thing also having in fvp a set of formula may have different meanings when applied to different phenomena
I if I can see fep relies heavily on
informational a concept of entropy Kristen argument
the first Formula is expressed free energy as energy minus entropy it
connects the concept of free energy as used in information Theory with Concepts used in statistics thermodynamics
just use two entropies with different meanings as concepts with same meaning
so a uh would you like to clarify this concept if I just misunderstand the
concepts uh also I have three further questions that may not
connect with the main commentary first the autonomy is crucial for fvp what
about living systems lack of obvious individuality like Aspen or coral reef
and the same question when you apply micro blanket to different levels of neural system
if they have their own autonomy we are the boundaries between different levels
the third question is Simpson fet takes Max Zoya as example action perception
Arc is a basic so what about plants which lack of obvious perception and
action how could we apply the free energy principle to plants two or other uh uh
unicellular living systems okay thank you uh thank you Ali Chen for the
interesting question and I think in this you have three minutes I think you should focus on the chance main question
and for the three minor question I think we should discuss that in the Q a Time
okay thank you so much um brilliant um um uh thoughts um I'm
really I'm happy to uh with both of them and I really want to address both of them I'm gonna first focus on the first
one which um I really really uh appreciate the way that you bring out the different formulations between um
thermodynamics entropy and information entropy this is a an issue that I I have an issue with myself so um I I
completely agree with you and I would love for us to further discuss this um eventually but there was one thing that
I wanted to just some clarification on because it seems that you start off by wanting to say um that mind and life are
not continuous precisely because of the difference between thermodynamics entropy and information entropy and I
might be completely on board with you I just needed some more clarification as per when you say that the same formula
applies to different fields I was a bit confused if you were referring these two Fields as one being the mind and the
other one being life yeah sorry I I I I I forget to clarify I
just focused one small part uh one for uh not living and the one for living
this is the part also there's a part of our living systems and uh spring sorry I
just give example yeah yeah like I was yeah yes clear so then um because
you have to I state that I understand your the the
the problem that you raised I I I am almost on board with it it's just the
link that you make with uh mind and life that I am probably uh going to dispute
because it seems that one on the one side you could have mind in life as
being continuous and then on the other side you might say well but there is all of these other things that are part of
natural world that uh could have their own Marco blankets could be seen a self-organizing systems but they differ
because they do they're not alive and there I would be completely on board with you right so to dispute that mind
is continuous with life I would not um uh be on board with that but I would
totally be on board that there is a difference that should be made between uh systems that are alive and systems
that are not alive and the difference uh there they both share features of being open systems right uh they will share
the feature but there is one differential which is what is living and the other one is not living and then you can say well we can the fep is unifying
because we can apply the fpp to any system that is an open system we could say that but there is a
differential to be made between a life and non-alife systems so there is a difference between moduling a pendulum
and moduling human behavior for example so that would be uh my initial thoughts
the the other comment that you have I think it's very important to address because it comes up many times so I
wanted to say that inactive inference when we refer to or when active inference researchers refer to active
States and sensory States they are not necessarily referring to them as sensory information or the senses right it's the
state's of a certain system so let's say that I want to uh apply active inference to understand
the reciprocal influence influences between coral reef and the environment
that the coral reef is at that is possible even if the coral reef doesn't have sensory organs like we do because
it's about the statistical states that the coral reef is at given the environment that it is situated at so
that's how you can do that because sensory does not necessarily map on to the sensory organs that a human would
have so a plant can be mapped or can be understood under active inference precisely because it's the sensory
States is just the states of the external system or the external States uh data system is coupled with which is
why when you raise the point of autonomy autonomy should be understood as a self-organizing system it doesn't matter
if it has a brain it doesn't matter if it has sensory organs it's just autonomous system is an organism that
self-organizes that's the idea okay thank you thank you
um I think we should start the discussion um open discussion um are there any people who wants to
waste your hand foreign
quiz please hi yeah can you hear me
yeah thanks so much for the the great talk uh it is and then and the great comments as well
um so I thought this was really interesting I like this discussion about the kind of life-mind continuity hypothesis
um so questions kind of on that but I think they're mostly covered but aside the questions
when someone is asking the question can you so
I'm not you know entirely familiar with this literature I kind of know the basics and I like Lok chi I kind of
learned a lot from it from your talk and I thought it was really helpful and but I was wondering so we you know in your
talk and also in the discussion kind of we're talking about cognition in general or Brilliance in general but I was
wondering what what kind of story people say about development and this kind of framework and it seems like that you
know that the minds of kind of young children are very very different to the minds of kind of adult humans with
language Etc and and so I was wondering is it just the exact same you know is it
kind of minimization of free energy and minimizing kind of prediction errors or
or is there a kind of Developmental kind of a learning story to be told as well and how does that affect this kind of
understanding of the free energy principle
Chris thank you so much for flagging that um that's that will allow me to now
to my research and where the fep comes into my research but also where the fpp where I then leave the fep
so that's quite quite thank you for that so there is a moment at which you cannot generalize anymore
right so the fpp might be extremely useful to understand in general
how systems are behaving so it's a
just interact with the environment it allows you some teleology for life right
for Behavior which is quite interesting um and then it allows you to model
um the understanding of phenotypes and um certain systems behaving so that's
what you gain with the fep but I think that generalizations must stop somewhere
and the the where they stop is with the raising or the augmentation of
complexity right so and um there is nothing there is more complex than human
behavior human behavior is highly complex in the sense that it's not that it's just difficult to understand
complexity is precisely defined to um a system is more complex the more it
is the more difficult it is to model or predict the system and I don't it's really hard to think of anything that is
more complex than human behavior it's extremely hard to predict a social
interaction for example right so here where Com when complexity starts
raising right that's where I find um my way into complex systems theory
and what I gained from complex systems theory is that it allows me to have an understanding of
um an individual as an individual trajectory and I'm I'm slowly going into your point your your question about
development it allows me to understand development not in a group level way
which is the tradition in cognitive psychology that's the mainstream approach in cognitive psychology it's
that development house these stages that are very generalizable with complex systems theory it offers you a complete
full-on mathematical toolkit that allows you to map a trajectory of an individual
personal development and why is this important this is important especially when we come up with uh mental health
problems and we want to help that particular individual in their particular individual developmental
trajectory so then with these particular mathematical Network mathematical
toolkit and something called network analysis we can develop intervention
plans for that particular development development trajectory alone so that's
what I find extremely useful is when we start raising up the complexity of
things and there's especially important in of course human behavior then I start abandoning the free energy principle I
think it is so I'm a pluralist I think that different tools are useful for different ends depending on the task the
scientific task that we are the philosophical puzzle that we have at end then tools are going to be useful I
don't think that the free energy principle is going to unify um and to the extent that it is going to
explain a developmental trajectory and mental health if if if if if you
understand what I mean but I do think it gives us a very um interesting and plausible way of
explaining how in general organisms adapt to their environment and have this
tendency to adapt to the environment then explaining how in particular each one does that then I turn into complex
systems theory thank you any next question
anyone who wants to raise your hand
I actually have some questions so one of my question is related to Tong Ying's
commentary so I I wonder if you have heard of
um in the metaphysics of mind they have the term Blockhead the fourth experiments which is a response to the
functionalist uh wheel so uh uh Blockhead is the idea I think
it's proposed by block so Network responsible says that if you have the
appropriate input and outputs then you have the function you have the functional State and you have the relevance mental States
and the idea of a blockhead system is that it has
the same inputs and outputs but it doesn't have those functional States because
um there's a very complex script within that machine in case if you give it um
input one then it will provide some sorts of outputs according to a scripts
and there's the script says that when you are faced with these inputs and you will provide these output but um it's
not that the system is doing any calculation or computation it says it says that the scripts are so complex
regarding those all possible counter factual situations which would happen
within this universe so for Blockheads human being it just acts like normal and
even responds to the same way but it's just that God has written a very complex within the the human headset so that it
reacts always reacts in the appropriate way but actually the system doesn't do
any calculation or computation computation or at most it's just recognized inputs and then it reacts
according to the scripts so my question is about um
creatures some simple creatures so maybe they have some scripts that were given
by Evolution but it's not that they are doing any sorts of computation of course
um as evolutionary tree is getting more complex and for the system to do more
work and to be more adaptive than it should be able to do some calculations
but I mean for some very simple organism maybe like the virus maybe it's just a
very simple block has system so it has some script inside when faced with um
input a then it gives um um outputs be it if when faced with input X
then it faces it gives some sort of outputs y then um in in some sorts of
ordinary General environments that uh it it lives in then it can always give some
sort of appropriate outputs that fits with the some somehow fits with the kinds of of active influence description
but still it says a broadcast system I think furthermore it can't be it can't
be really sad that is like doing active influence because once you take it away
from the sort of ordinary environments that it lives in then it just get mad
because it there's no it's it's face some inputs then uh is not within the
script and it can it just cannot react so I wonder if that's possible so I
wonder what you think about this possible scenario oh thank you so much for that
um so it is thank you for bringing up the notion of script because um since the computer revolution in the
50s um the whole philosophy of mine has been setting to uh with the Endeavor or the
goal of finding what those scripts are or defining what those scripts are I
don't want to take a realist assumption unnecessarily so just Define at least
what those scripts are and um what you have is um with um traditional computationalism
you have well those scripts are symbolic and the leveraging of those scripts is because the system understands uh
symbols and contentful uh and semantic symbols and that's what's Levering the mental representation that's what you
get with uh the modularity of the mind and uh traditional um traditional computationalism right
and then um uh later on you have uh the the questioning of this which is where
netblock comes in the questioning that because he's of course extremely um is
of course extremely uh motivated by uh the argument made by Sarah by the Chinese room that it is possible that
um rightly so that um that there is a computer just like these computers that we are using to communicate here today
that are following rules without understanding semantics so then we have the new era which is scripts that do not
understand semantics they just rule followers right and then you have the now you are in you've entered now the
all the brand new world of connection has been parallel distributed processing and thinking of the Mind still as
um inputs and outputs that aim to eventually output a mental representation that the agent can do
something with and can use except that that competition happens between the input and the output is not following
symbolic content but it's following hardwired rules and that's the script
that's the new script right so the question here and then you have these two options in the game right either you
are a traditional you are aligning with traditional computationalism symbols are understood by the Machine by the modules
or symbols are not understood by the modules and it's just a script still we need to lay out what this script is so
Francis Egan recently with the deflationary account of content she
tries to precisely say exactly that so she jumps on that bandwagon and she rightly so says well there's no content
it's just mathematics it's just mathematical rules uh in this in between these input and output this script is
made of mathematical rules it is quite interesting that this notion of script it plays such a
fundamental role there's a defining fundamental role in philosophy of Mind ever since the computer Revolution
because we are all after defining what this script is now how this relates to
fep it's quite interesting because if we think that the script is active
inference let's say that we want to say that the
what happens the competition that happens between the input and output takes the form literally of minimizing
free energy and active inference then we are taking realism about active
inference and we are saying that this script takes the form of the rules of active inverse that's it and we've
solved it and we can all go home because we now know how the brain works we can continue to develop all mathematical
models but we know now that the script is of the fep kind this is being realist about fep and of
course we have been in the past realist about many other computational languages
right so before the script was of the Turing kind was symbolic with Fodor and
then you have the script being of the syntactic kind like neural networks or parallel distributed processing this is
all us taking realism about different kinds of computational Power
right so that's how this uh script question has been permeating everything
that we do in philosophy of Mind including in the fep if we take the the realism
um path then we are saying that okay we found it the script is fep if we say
well there is rules that are followed by the brain for the brain to conduct its
work and by the way depending on how we Define cognition it's important for any
of us in the room to Define cognition for ourselves is condition reducible to the brain we tend to talk about the
brain but is cognition reducible to the brain but let's just stick with the brain um depending on how the brain follows
rules to um to conduct the uh there it's
excitatory um activity uh we don't know but do does a certain
model a computational model a mathematical model gives us certain predictive power yes or no yes it does
actually we were able to predict how the brain would behave given certain circumstances by virtue of using this
model and we are happy we are happy with this epistemic game
that's instrumentalism or no we are not happy because until we
Define what the script is we are not happy we we have to find that model that
is going to precisely match and tell us what kind the script is is it symbolic
is it syntactic is it Feb so this is for us as philosophers the
questions that we are dealing with and we need to answer for ourselves right or at least that's the ones that I find
interesting and how that would relate with the fep in this literature I think
um actually I have a follow-up I would see if this there are any other questions for now first
if not yet then I would ask my follow-up I think it's a very helpful answer but I
think my answer focused more on for a simple organism like virus just maybe
it's not this the uh the biologists say it might not be an organism or in my
it's a half organism or something like that but it still should be a self-organizing system so it matches
with that kinds of definition of uh are used in the um fpp discussion so I just
wonder if if it's possible that that thing doesn't do
any calculation or computation or not even influence it's just wired by the by
by its genes that um may be faced with um 10 possible
um stimul stimulus that will provide every time it provides uh the correct uh
response but it doesn't do any calculation it's quiet in these genes and I think one
um um feature of this kind of system is that is response its kinds of uh
response pattern of response does not generalize so once you give it the 11th
um stimulus then it turns response because it's not riot in his genes and maybe uh
for a plane like us then we can do some sort of computation and so and therefore
we can face with many different situations or some sorts of situations
not written in the genes we can still do some sorts of computation and give some sorts of very general patterns of
response but maybe for a while you just can't do so once you take it the 11th um
stimulus then it can't be spawns but still it's it can still maybe it can act
in a way that is somehow you can uh uh uh uh
somehow it can be described using your framework as long as it's within the
the 10 stimulus because it acts as if it's doing some sorts of active
influence because um the genes um uh maybe it's not some sort of RNA things
that encoded so uh so is uh so it's adapted
to its environments but it's it's not really calculating or or doing any influence so I wonder what you think
uh thank you so much um I actually I'm uh very I tend to avoid
um using the brain as an example because we tend to anthropomorphize the work
that the brain does and I do not agree with that um we tend to
um overstate uh the way that the brain works I think
um or the its influence um I think that the difference between
um simpler forms of life like bacteria or virus um all the way up to a human being the
difference is in complexity so we have very minimal complex systems and highly complex systems right and I think that
you can apply the the principle that none of them wants to die
right none of them so the principle is that however you find virus behaving
they are fighting for their life so that's the principle right and then
what you can do is you can use mathematical tools to predict a future
state of the system if the system is presently in a certain State given what
you know about this present state of the system you can calculate what the future state is going to look like what the
world is going to look like for that particular system right this has nothing to do on about the phenomenology of the
system what the system feels like none of that this is the bird's eye view of a scientist that is just predicting a
future State of Affairs in the same way that a weather scientist is predicting a future State of Affairs so it has
nothing to do with whether it is um bacteria or a human being the only
thing that really changes is that it is way easier to to predict a future state
for virus than it is to a human being because the levels of complexity augment
to a human being right but that is it right so that's why of course you can
apply the same reasoning across life regardless of complexity but then the
your computational power to predict a future state is going to diminish as complexity augments
right because the system itself has way more degrees of freedom so it's going to be way more difficult for us as
scientists to predict the future state of the system right so that's that's the idea so I
don't think that the free energy principle does not apply to minimal forms of cognition I think it does
actually really well there is no need for a brain unless unless you start with
the low road that's why I finished with that PowerPoint with like if you go this way
then this is a literature you go this way this is the literature if you start with the low road then you're starting
by the brain because you're centering cognition in the brain so then the bacteria becomes a little bit like how
do I now put this low road understanding to fit bacteria they don't have brains
then you're stuck you can only fit the bacteria story if you come through the hybrid
and that's where more mind life continuity is going to be happening if
you go to the low road the object of study is the brain and the scope is the brain so then you lose all of other
organisms that although alive might not be cognitive because they're brainless
I hope that this uh I will let Tom Ying ask this question
first yeah uh thanks for letting me to ask a
follow-up question yeah like uh I'd like to continue my my questions uh in my
comments because I I still found a um your answer very interesting
I really I'm really sympathetic with you with the uh the instrumental reading uh
we we scientists that we use the mathematical toolkits to model um biological systems uh
future States uh yes or no it really depends on future research maybe it was
success of successful critics uh biological systems future actions or behaviors or phenomenons without it
still depends okay it just if we it's like
I have a sense of voidance it's like we are living the most important question behind this what's
the nature of cognition what's the nature human Minds it's just and maybe just not
human Minds it's just how mental works for how living organisms work because it looks like
instrumental reading will keep will that keep that question aside and just focus on okay we have this wonderful complex
model that can successfully explain everything really literally everything and I mean about living organisms and
it just but whether the systems those systems are really minimizing free
energy it's not a question we are going to answer we don't know okay let's just set a question with that we are happy
with our instruments okay I mean yeah it's just it looks like I mean my the reason why I
bring an eyebrow about New England's representation theorem is that this will
eventually we are going to encounter a question is how what how and when
can we generalize the question about I mean fvp and active influence to
what living organisms actually do and actually are I mean it's just
okay so this is and furthermore he said I'm worried another word is that
I'm the instrumental reading might be in danger of you know I mean Miss uh misidentified
the targets because it looks like what you're trying to do is to model
a living organism that minimize free energy but not actually living organisms
okay just like just it's like a representation theorem in this theory is aims to model an idea original agents
rather than actual agents okay so I'm looking forward to how you
respond to these questions thanks yeah thank you so much for that um it's
interesting um the points that you make are quite relevant and interesting why is it relevant to instrumentalism uh to
model organisms note that I've said earlier I've mentioned this that
um the fep as a tool can be applied to anything that self-organizes
so what that means is that what it would Target is behavioral patterns
I didn't mention life or organisms I didn't make a differentiation I said it
can model pattern behavior so if you would not apply this tool what you would
have would be stuff confusion you would not understand a particular phenomenon
in front of you by virtue of putting the goggles so to speak of this particular
tool or any other scientific tool for a particular scientific problem or
epistemic gain then what you get is patterns understanding of a certain
particular Behavior right and it can be fep it can be a different it can be complexity complexity you can apply
attractors and repellers to explain so the behavior or pattern behavior of any
open system so that's what I said open systems right and most of what we find
in the natural world are open systems very rarely we would have closed systems
so then fep applies to all of that and then one has to be careful because you
might take me to be saying that oh then we have found the unifying theory that is going to explain everything
absolutely not that is not what I'm saying I say that we can apply the fep
to all self-organizing systems such that we gain an epistemic understanding of
how they are behaving but then we need to continue our research Endeavor to
explain and ask other further questions the task is not over so then you refer to the question of oh
I think we are not um we are not focusing on the most fundamental questions and your most fun and the one
that you identified as the fundamental question is the question in philosophy of mine which is what is the mind
and we are not focusing on that I understand you're worried that's the worry and philosophy of mine that is the
whole object and then of course we can deconstruct into other different problems and arguments but that's the
the question that has has been um the the the the philosophical puzzle
that we want to understand in philosophy of mind is what is the mind now the one I'm gonna make one fit Consignment point
and I'm gonna say that not all questions are empirical questions some questions
are philosophical questions what is the mind is a philosophical question I would say we can use our empirical
Tools in order to gain more understanding about the behavioral or
phenomena that we observe as agents engage and interact with the environment and that includes as well minimal
cognitive systems such as plants and bacteria that is all very important information but is that going to answer
the question of what is the Mind probably not why is that because that's an empirical setting or or a
computational modeling so I usually say that if everybody is making is making
computational models or if everybody is gathering data is collecting data then
there is nobody left to do the thinking and this was by the way a Von Neumann quote he's saying everybody makes models
everybody makes models but no one is left theorizing and this question that
you're asking is a very Newman Warrior as well who is left theorizing when everybody is worried in collecting data
and modeling potentially that is not where the answer is but we as
philosophers need to engage with all of that knowledge and be completely aware of all where of all the knowledge that
is coming from the scientific Enterprise in order to inform us to think and
reason and come up with a characterization of the phenomenon of
what is the phenomenon the mind what is the mind right of course there was an impasse uh we were worried about
defining what is the mind until functionalism came up that was the question pop excellence in
philosophy of mine was what is the mind and then because we became a little bit frustrated because we at least in the
west we became a little bit frustrated that we could not find any answers for what is the mind then functionalism
comes up as let's change the question and let's ask instead what is the function of the mind and ever since we
are asking in the west what is the function of the mind right so if we have
science and scientific models and scientific um um empirical studies trying to
understand how the mind works by and by virtue of reducing the mind to the brain then we have Western philosophy of mind
asking what is the function of the mind and we left what is the mind as an
unanswered question so that would be my take on it so I basically I'm agreeing with you
yeah thanks for the collaboration thanks
um and the next question I actually have a question um uh because you in your presentation
you mentioned there are three kinds of theories of cognition in um the the more
General under the fep label the pmlp and ffdp so we have the plain Theory the
brain body Theory and the theory that includes the environments so I wonder if we are we we
are forced to choose between these theories and you seem to hint that you you
seem to hint that you you you like the high road which uh comes from the more
embodied uh path but I wonder if um so it's a really we are really forced to
make choices between them because I can Wonder uh within a system there are there are
minor subsystems and those subsystems are also self-organizing systems for example we can imagine a cell in my body
that also operates um according to fep so we this means that we can we can
imagine that even from a high roads way of thinking I can imagine that my brain
or or or some sort of my qualitative system is some sort of self-organizing
system and but within here but there's there's one big
self-organizing system which includes my body and maybe some big self-organizing
system so in your presentation you mentioned some empirical findings which
some some favors the more embodied um um way of thinking in some favors that
the real that the brain is already A self-organizing system that uh maybe the
the mark of blankets applies so I wonder if we are
forced to make a choice or or if they're just different um layers of self-organizing system
which of uh and all of them follows the energy principle yeah
now thanks so much for for letting me expand a little bit on on the differences between those series and
whether or not we could be um we can endorse uh the three of them or do we
have to make a choice I think we do um so as as in everything that we do in
science uh science is fundamentally um philosophically motivated so even if
scientists have no idea um because they haven't thought about it there is always philosophical assumptions
um underlying the initial design of a an experiment or the initial design of a
model or the interpretation of results both in models and in um in empirical
settings um so you will see that the prediction error minimization by virtue of reducing
cognition to the brain is taking a philosophical stand
so the Bayesian brain hypothesis takes a philosophical stand because it takes as
the underlying of it the definition of cognition is it reduces to the brain
so then anyone that is working in the Bayesian brain so to put it like that
anyone that is working in the vision brain by applying predictive coding to uh brain data analysis so to understand
the neurodynamics of neural activity
um is taking a stand when they um describe uh the use of predictive coding
in explaining these neural Dynamics if they attribute the case that they
believe that the brain believes exactly with a cell making a prediction to
another cell and then receiving a prediction error updating a model and all of that happening in neurodynamics
then they're being realist about predictive coding even if they don't
know that um they are being realist about so there
is when you see predictive coding in this particular way you realize how much
or how many philosophical assumptions are underlying that particular scientific practice that was chosen to
be done in that way right so then you have you turn it to philosophy and then you have philosophy
instead of critically analyzing that scientific practice stands
adopting it and borrowing it to further develop a theory of mind but note how it
started as a reduction of cognition to the brain and then it's peaked out to philosophy
to develop a theory of mind there's something that doesn't really work here because look at all the levels of
obstruction that we are jumping around and completely confused right so then we have Jacob who he's saying
um well uh the mind is the brain at work so literally it's an application of predictive coding as a mathematical tool
to understand brain data analysis so to start making the end of the sense of the the data that is coming from brain scans
so we pick up that package and we apply that in philosophy of mind to say that
well predictive coding is exactly what cognition is and it's in the brain and
you can now throw away the body the world and other people they play absolutely no role cognition and the
mind is the brain cells making predictions and receiving prediction errors that's mind
and that is Jacob Hui prediction error minimization so then you take a step further and then
Annie Clark comes in with something innovative and says well actually Jacob it's not
really like that reductionist because the body actually plays a role the body is this medium between the brain and the
world right but note that the body in this particular
um radical predictive processing that Annie Clark advocates for the body is
just more computation there is nothing phenomenological about it in the
phenomenological tradition of merlopunty of a body being that I can go to the
world nothing like that so when Annie Clark talks about embodiment that is not the embodiment he's talking about
the body is just more computer it's an extension of the computer
so Andy Clark becomes a little bit radical because only in respect to jakub
who is cognition reduces to predictive processes in the brain that's the only radical bit about predictive processing
because the body is just more computation right now when is step two
active inference and free energy principle if you take the low road then it's very much siding with both
prediction error minimization and radical predictive processing because all there is is mind reduced to
computation either in the brain or in the brain problems you impose the body with motor control system Theory and
that's done and we can all go home or you go you take the high road and
then it's a much more biologically biological uh motivated kind of theory
because it tries to um say that whatever the organism
whatever the organism is a cell a brain it doesn't matter whatever the state the organism is at is a consequence of the
relational influences between the organism and the environment and here
you can if you want you can understand this a little bit more in terms of
phenomenology the relational aspects between the subject and the object so
one state only is what it is because there is this state and this state only is what it is because there is this
state and this is basics in phenomenology so then you can it allows you to
um interpret or it allows you to interpret or to bring in or expand this
understanding of the behavior of our systems interact with the environment and expand that philosophically in a way
that is richer I would say I would argue as opposed to comparing the cognitive
the all the diversity and richness of cognitive behavior that all organisms
interact with or engage with but especially human beings because they have more sophisticated ways or and more
or higher degrees of freedom to interact with the world there are so so so rich that I think it's extremely reductive to
think about it as reducing to an analogy with a computer with inputs and outputs
so particularly I find much more appealing to take a biology inspired
approach and understand their limits such as the free energy principle and active inference as opposed to
taking a literal sense of predictive coding as a computational tool to make
sense of the data that you collect from a scanner and just say that that's mind
that I find extremely reduction okay um I I can see that you are not
accepting the lower your going the high road or along then I can see that uh
we have to make a choice but even if we are going from the high road is it possible that the plane is is already a
self-organizing system and the board is a bigger self-organizing system and the
cell is a smaller one or or maybe it seems that there's an empirical question and that's possible it's still possible
that the pain is a self-organizing system absolutely anything there is an open system and Beyond open system is
something that is exchanging energy or matter information with an environment
so that's an open system anything that is an open system is a self-organizing system so it is in this condition that
it is autonomous because it self-organizes so the boundary is
defined by the self-organizing uh processes that are taking place meaning that what is a self-organizing system is
a system that doesn't need an external intervention that commands how they are going to behave they know they they in
within the interactions that occur within the system they self-organize into us in a certain way so that's a
self-organizing system and yes so the the the the the the the quicker way to
answer that is that any system that self-organizes can be explained with the Markov blankets in these structures
precisely because it is a system that is sufficiently autonomous but it's precarious in the sense that it needs to
interact with the environment to maintain its existence okay thank you Christian do you have any
question you have me turning on your video camera or no
I have been listening I'm content with listening thank you
okay uh we are running out of time so uh
um I wonder if uh Innes if you still want to answer the 10 question or uh we
should just finish because he has three questions more questions in the chat box right
oh let me open the chat um let me see uh I think we already
covered the coral reef because the coral reef is a self-organizing system it doesn't mean it doesn't matter if it has
a brain or not and we already covered that sensory states do not necessarily mean that we need sensory systems like
sensory organs um and then two entropies we also
already covered that I would definitely like to follow up on this with you maybe like by email or something because I
think that you are on to something that is really really cool even though I do think that there is continuity between
my life and mind but I think you are on to something to make a differentiation between self-organizing systems that
have life and self-organizing systems that do not have life I think that's really really cool
um and I think that we covered the other ones unless you want to flag something
out for me that I might be uh that I might have not addressed
your system is lacking right but anyway so I hope that um Ethan's
questions have all been answered and we thank you very much uh uh we thank Ennis
very much for uh giving the very interesting talk and um I really enjoyed to talk and I think
um most of us have learned a lot from Innis talk and I I should admit that
they are not there are not a lot of people asking questions but I'm sure that that's because that's a very that's
a very special topic so some people I'm sure a lot of people I see that a lot of
people getting online and listening but I think to get adapts to these kinds of
very special topic might just take some time but I hope I'm sure that there
there was some very interesting there were some very interesting exchange between us uh uh especially uh I think
there were some questions being asked and there is some very interesting responses from Innis so um
uh please join me in thanking um Innes in any way possible online
so I hope that there will be opportunities for some further exchange maybe in Taiwan or maybe in mainland
China since our two commentators are working in mainland China or maybe we
could have opportunities to have field Exchange in anywhere in this world so um thank
