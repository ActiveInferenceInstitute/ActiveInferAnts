#### Program Requirements
The Division of Physics (PHY) supports a wide range of physics research and the training of future scientists across various disciplines. The solicitation encourages proposals that enhance diversity and broaden participation in STEM fields. It emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary research and collaboration across scientific domains.

#### Award Information
- **Type of Award**: Standard Grant, Continuing Grant, or Cooperative Agreement
- **Estimated Number of Awards**: Approximately 300
- **Anticipated Funding Amount**: $120 million annually, subject to availability.

#### Eligibility
Proposals may be submitted by:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- For-profit organizations with capabilities in scientific research or education.
- State and local governments, tribal governments, and foreign organizations (for U.S. portions only).
- There are no restrictions on the number of proposals per organization or PI.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Key points include:
- No letters of intent or preliminary proposals are required.
- Full proposals must include a detailed project description, budget, and justification.
- Letters of collaboration are permitted but must follow a specific format.

#### Review Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process based on two primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Additional criteria may apply for proposals involving large investments or long-duration efforts, including scientific and technical feasibility assessments.

#### Award Administration
Awards will include specific conditions and reporting requirements. PIs must submit annual project reports and a final project report upon completion. The NSF emphasizes the importance of compliance with reporting timelines to ensure future funding opportunities.

#### Additional Information
The solicitation highlights the NSF's commitment to fostering a diverse workforce in physics and encourages proposals that address this goal. It also outlines specific requirements for proposals that involve Antarctic or Arctic logistics support, mid-scale research infrastructure, and long-duration efforts.

#### Conclusion
NSF 23-615 provides a structured framework for submitting proposals for physics research projects, emphasizing the importance of scientific innovation, collaboration, and diversity in the field. Researchers are encouraged to consult with program officers for guidance on proposal suitability and funding opportunities. The solicitation aims to advance the frontiers of physics while contributing to societal goals through impactful research and education initiatives.
