### Summary of IARPA Broad Agency Announcement: IARPA-BAA-24-02

#### Introduction
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments" (SoURCE CODE), aimed at developing innovative technologies to assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks based on coding styles. This initiative is critical in enhancing national security by improving the attribution of cyber threats and attacks.

#### Key Dates and Amendments
- **Release Date:** November 15, 2023
- **Amendment 001:** December 13, 2023
- **Amendment 002:** January 19, 2024

#### Program Overview
The SoURCE CODE program addresses the increasing complexity and volume of cyberattacks, which pose significant threats to national security. The program aims to automate and assist forensic experts in attributing these attacks by analyzing coding styles and similarities in binary and source code files. The goal is to develop technologies that can provide insights into the likely origins of attacks, enhancing the response capabilities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

#### Funding Opportunity Description
The BAA outlines a 30-month program divided into two phases:
- **Phase 1 (18 months):** Focuses on developing methods for feature extraction and similarity analysis between source code and binary representations.
- **Phase 2 (12 months):** Extends capabilities to include cross-representation matching (source code to binary and vice versa).

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives
Offerors are required to propose solutions addressing three focus areas:
1. **Feature Space Generation and Extraction:** Develop encoding schemes that optimize the representation of source code and binaries.
2. **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms:** Create systems to identify similar binaries and infer demographic information about authors.
3. **System Explainability:** Ensure that the systems provide interpretable feedback to forensic experts.

#### Team Expertise and Collaboration
The program encourages multidisciplinary collaboration among offerors, emphasizing the inclusion of experts in fields such as binary analysis, software engineering, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Teams are expected to demonstrate a mix of skills necessary to achieve the program's objectives.

#### Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals must adhere to specific guidelines, including:
- Strong theoretical foundations for proposed strategies.
- Identification of technical risks and mitigation strategies.
- Exclusion of approaches relying solely on existing cybersecurity solutions without innovation.

#### Program Data
The program will utilize both development and evaluation datasets, with a focus on creating a robust data collection initiative to support research and development. The Test and Evaluation (T&E) team will curate datasets to fill existing gaps in academic datasets, ensuring a diverse representation of coding styles and demographics.

#### Testing and Evaluation
The T&E process will be rigorous, involving independent evaluations of performer deliverables against defined metrics. The program aims to ensure that research outcomes are well-characterized and aligned with program objectives.

#### Proposal Submission Information
Offerors must submit proposals that comply with the specified format and content requirements. The submission includes:
- **Volume 1:** Technical and Management Proposal (limited to 25 pages for TA1).
- **Volume 2:** Cost Proposal (submitted only upon request).

#### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on:
1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**
2. **Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan**
3. **Contribution and Relevance to IARPA Mission**
4. **Relevant Experience and Expertise**
5. **Resource Realism**

#### Award Information
The government anticipates multiple awards based on the quality of proposals and available funding. The selection process will be competitive, with the government reserving the right to negotiate terms and conditions.

#### Eligibility Information
All responsible sources are eligible to submit proposals, including small businesses and academic institutions. However, foreign entities may only participate as part of a U.S.-based team.

#### Conclusion
The SoURCE CODE program represents a significant opportunity for innovative research in the field of cybersecurity and forensic analysis. By leveraging advanced technologies and collaborative efforts, the program aims to enhance the capabilities of forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks, ultimately contributing to national security.
