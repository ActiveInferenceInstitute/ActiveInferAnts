Dr Chris Fields interviewed by Matt Gray

hi Chris hello Matt thank you thanks for joining us um just give a bit of an
intro and then um sort of you could take over from a bit um so since 2010 you you've published a ton of papers I've
worked out that it's roughly sort seven and a half papers a year um so it's kind of like a paper every 50 days right um
on physics the free energy principle biology philosophy cognition Math free will autism um so it's you know if if
the word polymath is is to be used anywhere it's right here um you've also published with Levin friston Hoffman
some of my previous guests so be looking to get some views on some of those fields and some of their theories
um I promised um my viewership that I would finish your physics information processing um course online which is
fantastic by the way I didn't finish that um apologies um but I do have some questions about that specifically as
well um so yeah fantastic um also I noticed that you do some art and it
might be interesting to understand and I think some of that visual art is perhaps you're suggesting it captures some of
the ideas we're working with more technically and that's that's fascinating so perhap something about that as well so um Chris how did you get
into this stuff um you know tell a bit about your background you got a PhD in philosophy of science so kind of how did
you get into it and and and why philosophy of science uh well I I started out as an
experimental physicist as um certainly some
philosophers of science too and uh I
moved from there to uh teaching logic in the philosophy Department
as a graduate student and uh started working in philosophy of science because
that was kind of a natural thing for me to do given my background and was simultaneously
becoming interested in biology so for a while I was uh a
student in both philosophy and biology but um after I got my degree I ended up
with a small AI company that fairly quickly went belly up but then
working in an AI lab in in New Mexico and from there moved into the Human
Genome Project um because I'd been working in
bioinformatics and so my career was kind of an odd mix of
Academia and uh the not for-profit sector and then the private sector
so um I don't know my background is kind of a random walk through academic
disciplines so so do you think in some sense that diversity of kind of experience and and thinking I guess um
is that what leads to your sort of quite holistic approach to to science and so on well it it must have something to do
with it I you know I'm very broadly interested in things and and um that led
to a certain lack of focus shall we say yeah I think I can relate to this
and there's something you said on this area this this idea of the convergence of the disciplines and I think if I may
I think you're quoted as saying that in some sense there should be no distinction between sort of physics
philosophy biology is that is that fair did you really say that well yeah I
think that is fair you know a few hundred years ago there wasn't
and then with the rise of the University as an institutionalized
system um and its departure from um being primarily a religious
system uh we got this diversification of disciplines which were were natural when
they happened but I think what we started to
see in the 20th century and certainly you're seeing now is that um this old
idea of cutting nature at the joints really doesn't make so much sense anymore
and people talk about theories of everything what they typically mean is some sort of reductionist
physics but uh an alternative is
this idea that there may be scale free descriptions mathematical
descriptions such as prison's free energy principle that apply at many
scales and maybe apply at all scales and if that turns out to be a
productive way to think then I think we will see a real uh
convergence of people who started out working in different
disciplines but who end up working in much the same way on problems at
different scales uh with a lot of ability to exchange ideas and techniques
and methodology maybe not experimental methodology but theoretical methodology
between disciplines so I do I I do think that's happening now and that we'll see
more of it over the next decade or so so could I just ask I mean do you
think philosophy belongs in science in terms of theory practice and so
on well in a sense I think science can't escape philosophy
and philosophy can't escape science so um a good friend of mine uh is a
philosopher named Eric Dietrich currently of Bingington he's actually one of my oldest friends and he wrote a
paper years ago called there is no progress in philosophy and uh he he started this paper out
imagining that uh Aristotle appeared in a modern
University and wandered around to the physics department and the biology department and the geology department
and so on and sat in on lectures and was completely baffled and very embarrassed
because it seemed like you know everything that he'd said was wrong but then he wandered over to the philosophy
department and found that he understood everything and the questions being talked about were exactly the same as the questions he'd written about and
that his ideas were completely current so uh I we do have this background if
you will of um kinds of concerns that haven't really changed in
Millennia yeah and um science doesn't
make those concerns go away right yeah can it though do you
think is it possible to peel back some layers and say yes we can claim some
metaphysical knowledge is that possible well I think
we I think we get clearer the more science we do about what in fact we
don't know or can't know so if you look at things like
Hoffman's interface theory of perception or the notion of a mark on blanket in um
statistical analysis for example that underlies the free energy
principle um these are kind of formal ways of saying what Hume was saying very
informally so we we develop these formalisms that make it very clear
that certain kinds of knowledge when you talk
about knowledge in some strong sense or unattainable and you know the the great
profit of all of this is girdle and I I think we see um Echoes of girdle's work
now increasingly throughout the Sciences uh certainly in physics uh in
areas like game Theory uh in in in all areas of science
where math is is playing a major role that's interesting so so do you
think girdle's Theory potentially applicable to language as well is there a sense in which language can never fully describe itself and this kind of
thing um yeah well I think in a sense that's what gle's theory the says that
languages can't completely describe eles and
[Music] um the 1950s
cyberneticists figured out that uh individual systems can't completely
describe themselves so the idea of a self model
for any system is is necessarily very limited and it's always a model
constructed by part of the system of the rest of the system and it it can't fail to be
heuristic right there not enough degrees of freedom for it not to be heuristic so uh and that cybernetic
tradition uh builds directly on early computer science which built directly on
girdle so there's a real lineage of ideas there that
um are now pervading more and more of science just I just Chris you want to go back to
that idea of convergence across disciplines right so that I think the narrative is that that seems to be where
the fruit is born you know when we abandon those kind of old par you know sort of Divisions if you like now is
that because the models that we're putting forward that do um transcend the disciplines is that because they're
closer to reality or yeah are they more you know
are they are we getting closer to to to a reliable description of of fundamental reality if I could put it
the way at least the way I see this uh transition toward more scale-free
descriptions and certainly the way I see say the free energy principle is
as an approach to doing science or thinking about science that takes the
idea of observation serious iously and
that um applies scientific thinking to
the process of observation and hence to the notion of an
observer so as we start to model ourselves as
observers in this abstract way as as systems that are interacting with some
other systems some environment and uh thus exchanging
information with it uh we we suddenly gain a whole set of
formal tools that we didn't have before or or
we had them we just didn't think to to apply them to the idea of what we were
doing to to science itself and
so this starts to look like a Gillian situation
right science itself becoming in a sense self-referential and indeed uh when we
apply these these tools of of basically the physics of interaction or the
cybernetics of information exchange or whatever to the activity of doing
science we start to call into question ideas like
replicability uh things start to look Observer relative and so forth so a
whole raft of um what used to be thought of as ontological questions get heavily
reformulated if not abandoned altogether so notion of an observer independent
onology kind of turns into the notion of a a
pragmatic ontology that a bunch of observers agree about yeah so um if if I may I I just
want to sort of um take the path into the sort of physics as information processing here because some of what you're saying reminds me of I got up to
S of lecture four I think and I had a quick look at the SpaceTime one um and it's just it's it's so beautifully
elegant because it does away with all of the presuppositions doesn't it in the kind of physicalist account does away
with the assumption that there's any kind of distance between interacting you know agents and it it says this is about
communication right so could you could you talk a little bit about that and why is that why why is it useful to sort of
sort of redraft the free energy principle in that sort of physics context and and and what can be done with it that it'd be great to hear your
thoughts on this well I I would say that
um in a sense in thinking about the free energy princi through um the lens of physics I'm I'm
I'm following in a sense in Carl friston's footsteps and that he
started um long before I did uh re reformulating what had originally been
ideas about Neuroscience in a much more General language uh and he was using uh
a classical statistical language but many of the ideas carry over into quantum theory beautifully and
and quantum theory really just removes another couple of assumptions so I think the the the argument for thinking in
Quantum information terms is that it allows you to make as few assumptions as
possible and one of the assumptions that you don't have to
make is the Assumption of embedding SpaceTime A Spacetime background and it
that forces you think about what SpaceTime is for what's what role is spacetime actually playing in this
Theory and one of the roles that SpaceTime plays in the classical free
energy principle or In classical thinking about communication is a role of keeping the
communicating Partners distinct by keeping them in different
places and so by by imposing this notion of spatial
coordinates uh embedding the the the interacting systems and some fixed
coordinate system how you can make the difference between their state
spaces obvious by putting those State spaces in different Geographic
places distinct they're distinct because of that that distinct locations yeah yeah right
so one can then ask okay well what does that have to do with the idea in the
free energy principle that's really playing a key theoretical role which is the idea of of mutual conditional
statistical Independence well in a sense if they're in different
places then you get that for free uh you get it from
relativity right you get it from this notion that uh communicating across some
distance requires time and so uh the interaction is forced to be causal in in
the relativistic sense of of information traveling a finite velocity so uh you you get this idea of
independence from the idea of spatial separation and actually there's
a a a quotation that I've used in papers from Einstein that I am not going to be
able to remember correctly but uh it it basically comes down to look this is
just what statistical Independence means uh they're they're separated in a
way or this is just what separation means that they're statistically
independent so let's remove that assumption okay of of this embedding
SpaceTime and think of these systems as just
occupying um parts of some big joint State
space and call that the state space of the universe or whatever you know assume that this state space is isolated
there's nothing outside of it it includes everything that's of interest does does this
sorry then we can think about cutting this state space of the boundary any place we want in any arbitrary
way and we can ask suppose I slice the state space in this
way um do I get systems on the two sides of this
boundary that are conditionally statistically independent and it turns out that
whether I get independent systems depends on how I described the state space in the first place right um the
was beautiful work uh by uh Zanardi and other people in the early 2000s showing
that um whether a system is entangled in the
quantum theoretic sense whether it's separable depends on how it's
described so this notion of of separateness uh isn't ontological in
some sense it's description dependent and doesn't in some sense come with the issue of sort of action action
at a distance doesn't it if if you say that there is some spatial distance that needs to be traversed in order for objects have an effect on each other in
some sense that sounds crazier than there being um sort of just instant
connections between communicating agents or something you know that it sort of actually sounds crazy when you crazier when you look at it but intuitively we
think in terms of a space-time realm don't we we we it looks like we live in one and that's what 90% of the sort of
lay public would say that they're inside the cosmos right um would you but would
you fundamentally disagree with that then well it's it's what I I think at
least 90% of the scientific Community would say to yeah yeah true and
philosophical and philosophical as well you know right this idea of emergent SpaceTime is a
fairly new idea that I think is really limited to
people who work in gravity right uh and you know even there
uh they're advocates for the idea that SpaceTime is fundamental U but I think there's a
growing movement uh of of theories in which SpaceTime isn't fundamental in
which it's emergent from something or other and the most obvious something or
other is information exchange of some kind right and this idea you know
historically goes back to John archal Wheeler papers that he wrote in the 70s
so it's at this point a 50-year old idea at any
rate so NE have you heard of narakam Med the high energy physicist I mean he's talking about these ampl Deedra which
are kind of spa a a spatial or a spao temporal and they're projecting into um
space time and they do better maths with scattering amplitudes and things like that so have you have you come across that work and is that in the space is
that in the space you're talking about right yeah and they they're I mean his
his Focus has been on scattering uh and most of the work on emergent SpaceTime
is just focused on making some set of assumptions from which one can replicate
general relativity you know get some space that satisfies Einstein's
equations so that's in a sense the other um
big component of this kind of theoretical work so
um I think I think it's interesting when starting to think about this
to to keep asking this question what's SpaceTime for and uh to also think about in our
own experience where does SpaceTime come from and uh that latter question is a
question that I think we can answer from a developmental biology and developmental psychology point of view
uh certainly infant humans uh you can watch kind of learning about SpaceTime
by by doing motor babbling you know lying on their backs and waving their arms around waving their feet around
and um what's going on is the their
brains are starting to encode a representation of the relationship
between muscular effort and visual feedback and propri acceptive
feedback so they're they're constructing a representation of
space by using a a resource that they have
which is um a set of muscles and the ability to detect
effort so you don't in a sense have to be born with this idea of of 3D space
you can build it and things like object permanence as well you know these are things that are learned aren't they yeah
yeah these they develop very early and and we're
we clearly have some prenatal pre sensory predilection to build this
notion of object permanence uh but it it is a computation
it is something that we have to learn to develop and I mean that brings up the
whole idea question of what's identity through time you know what's what's time
uh why do we make this assumption that there's a past that you know we have access to it
through memory Etc and these are all just experiences that are happening right now but we layer all of this
meaning onto them which is very useful
and so uh we we see objects as existing
independently of us uh even though every time we open our
eyes we're expending massive cognitive effort effort to figure out what's right in front of our
faces and um the the free energy principle is basically a theory of how
we do that right do we have to do it entirely bottom up like a lot of old theories
suggested or do we do it in this basian way where we have a a model that we just
test for violations of which is in a sense very efficient
do you believe in free will Chris if I could just ask that direct straight question or is or is that a bad question
uh no I think it's a good question and you know I'll refer back here to
U the a theum that was published a couple of decades ago by Conway and coken with the title The Free Will
theorem and they they later published a paper called the strong Free Will
theorem and the uh the latter paper I think in the bulletin of the American
mathematical Society I can't remember where the first paper came out um but Conway is is Conway of of
Conway's Game of Life and and cooken is Koken of
the cocen Spectre theorem which was one of the fundamental theorems in quantum theory so what they
showed was in in the first theorem they they mainly used reasoning
from uh relativity Theory to show that if you have a situation with an observer
and some system that's being observe then if the Observer is regarded
as having free will in a very specific sense uh they Define Free Will as
uh your be if you have free will your behavior is not determined by
the what what went on in your past light cone so uh your past light cone is what
can causally affect you in uh relativity
Theory so if your behavior is not determined by what can causally affect you I.E um you're not subject to local
determinism then um everything you're observing has the same property that its
behavior is not determined by its past like come
so that first version was basically the claim that or
the demonstration that if there's something in the universe that is not subject to local
determinism then everything in the else in the universe isn't subject to it either and the stronger version of the
theorem uh took away some of this Observer
relativity um and or it really abstracted it uh and it uses more more
of quantum theory and it basically says that under
kind of any reasonable reading of what the notion of observation
means uh nothing observable is subject to local
determinism so this this is this is again a very specific uh meaning of Free
Will and it's in a sense just the
opposite of what is sometimes meant by Free Will right sometimes when people
think about Free Will what they mean is that if I have free will I can execute
local determinism yes right so I can determine this is yeah I can yeah
if if if you've seen Talks by John surl for example he he was fine of saying you
know I have free will if I if I think I want my hand to go up then my hand goes
up and um that actually is contradicted by the
free will the the free will the says no you're not subject to local determinism
but you can't execute local determinism either because nothing else is subject to local
determinism so um what I think the Free Will theorem does is at a deep level is
point out the contradiction between the notion of local
determinism and the notion of global determinism so the the old kind of laian
notion of global determinism which is also evident in for example the the short
equation um or the notion of unitarity in quantum theory is the notion that
that everything evolves together right that the universe is one
big system and it's undergoing some sort of evolution foliation kind of yeah and
you know what one part of it does affects what every other part of it does
and that's really kind of a misstatement because in a pure Quantum State there
aren't any parts so there's just one state and it's rotating around in its Hilbert space and
that's that is that is that the wave function is one one universal wave function right so if you think that way
that's a very globally determinist way to think but it's completely inconsistent with local
determinism uh so I I think that's really what this notion of of
Freedom that Conway and Cen are pointing to uh is is indicating now there's
another way to look at that which is a very common way to think about it in
physics which is freedom means the freedom if you're a
system to choose a set of basis vectors with which to describe your
observations so if I'm an observer and I have some
apparatus then uh for example I can choose whether to uh set the magnets on
my apparatus to observe spins in the vertical
direction or or spands in the horizontal Direction so uh a a clean example is if
I have a polarizing filter I can Orient it this way right or that way that's my
choice I can do that um and if you think about this idea
of choice of basis um it really corresponds to
choosing what I'm going to be able to do with my measurements
H and um if you then think in kind of
um Gregory bateson's terms about differences that make a difference uh the idea that meaning has
to do with what I can do with some information that meaning has something
to do with action ability then essentially by Choosing My
measurement basis I'm I'm choosing what I can do with the information that I
get so effectively what I'm choosing is my semantics my way of interpreting the
world so this way of thinking about freedom of choice is uh I as an observer
or I as a system am free to choose the
kind of computations I do with the information that I get so I'm free to choose the the meaning that I assign to
some information that's flowing in from my environment and I'm also free to
choose the the measurement basis when you say you're free to choose
Chris these things are still just happening automatically right you're not talking about conscious sort of choice here are you you're just talking about
the the emerging model right
maybe yeah you've you've introduce the notion of Consciousness um which is itself a very
problematic notion yeah so uh let's let's stick to
the to the language of choice now and maybe talk about Consciousness later but
uh in in this sense of of choice I I can choose how to interact with my
environment so I can choose my meaning of the information
that I give my environment yeah now my environment has exactly the same
freedom of choice that I have and again that's the Conway cocen
theorem um and it's my to the extent that my environment is conditionally
independent of me to the extent that it's separable from me not entangled with me it has
free choice of B too so my environment can pick whatever
meaning it wants to give to my actions on it which are just its
perceptions and that brings in the the idea of the mar maroven boundaries doesn't it and so this right right right
could you perhaps talk a little bit about that and and the idea of you know more more fundamentally what a what is a
thing you know and um it would be because you know I mean one of the things that KL said to me when I I spoke
to recently that you know in some sense the um Act of inference and so on is more fundamental than any physics
because in order to describe a thing you need to understand what a thing is right so if you you're going on to do the
Dynamics of things you need to what do we mean by things so is that is that true yeah I I think that's that's um
that's a very good way to put it uh I I'm not sure that I would say that active inference is more fundamental
than physics I I think I would say that active in a sense is fundamental physics right
yeah yeah yeah so again think of of some giant State
space just some bunch of degrees of freedom that uh is the state space of
what we want to call our universe of interest uh everything that's relevant
everything that that is going on and we we SL that state space
someplace and if we've sliced it in in kind of an appropriate
way then U we're going to find that the the systems on the two sides of the
slices have internal states that are not really uh involved in the interaction so
if the boundaries the boundar is fairly small compared to the size of the
systems uh The interaction's Fairly weak okay uh so in Carl's language the two
are sparsely coupled uh and again in his language uh
flows of information that start on one side generally stay on that side and only a little bit of information pass
back and forth across the boundary but the amount of information pass back and forth isn't trivial so we
don't think of two gazillion degrees of Freedom systems that are interacting with a one bit wide
Channel can't learn much about each other that way yeah but suppose they're interacting via a reasonable Channel
with you know a few million bits or something like that then then they can talk back
and forth they can really exchange some information um
but they still have lots of lots of degrees of freedom with which they can
play right they're they're behavior is not determined by the behavior on the boundary that's what conditional
Independence means right yeah so so we haven't talked about things
yet before we get to things Chris could I just want could I just ask is there some sort of convergence there with some
of Donald Hoffman's thinking there um around what you were just
saying well um yes there is you know I
Don's uh notion of an of an interface the interface theory of
perception just is this notion of a boundary yeah yeah and I think what I was yeah what I was trying to say the
information that that can be passed between systems just that yeah I reminded myself now so what it was is
because he he he uses um game evolutionary Game Theory to demonstrate or formally demonstrate that agents
don't receive full information about their environment in fact it would it would kill them if if they did right um
so they we only receive what's useful to our survival and so on and so forth um and that just seemed to remind me of
what you were saying about the you know the The Exchange transfer across that boundary it's a kind
of yes is there a parallel there am I just imagining things yeah no there there is a parallel there
and uh I actually have a slide and oh
fantastic really a talk that let let me just see if I
have this uh that'd be awesome handy enough to to show it to you in a
sensible way
um yeah here we go um let me just share this slide on the screen
awesome there can you see that right do I need to blow it up to
full screen or let's have a look uh that looks that no that's perfect absolutely perfect thank you okay so so let's think
about this idea of dividing a universe into two pieces with a
boundary and um this this slide shows three ways of doing
it and uh the way on the left is this idea of two really big systems that are
communicating via a tiny channel so they can't learn very much about each other that could be me and
you right or you and well we're we're communicating by by a a small Channel
but uh we can still exchange language for example and video so you know
there's there a few million bits being being involved here
um the the example I gave here was was John Wheeler's notion of a a black hole
that has a huge volume but a very small Horizon he called it a bag of gold and
there's there's almost no information flowing in or out of this black hole so another extreme
possibility is that um the boundar is
very large so and this is on the far right
um so that the system on the the left side here almost all of its degrees of
freedom are very close to the boundary and what that means is that it
doesn't have very many many internal States right and in the limit it doesn't
have any internal States all of its states are so close to the boundary that uh its state is completely
determined by what's going on in its boundary and that just just means that it's no longer a distinct system right
it's no it's no longer conditionally independent of its environment it's being completely controlled by its
environment what kind of an example in the real world you like a grain of sand or something like that or well the the
example I used here u in this talk which was a a talk for physicists was a boltzman brain which is this idea of a
statistical fluctuation somewhere in the universe that has exactly the s ations
and memories of a human being but it's just a statistical fluctuation that lasts for an NC or something so it's uh
its state is completely determined by uh just this momentary encoding on an
Environ on a boundary and then it goes away it doesn't have any actual degrees
of freedom that are its so um somewhere in the middle are are
boundaries that are just right they they separate systems that are that are both
big and they give them enough of an Communication channel that they can exchange a fair amount of
information so I'll throw in something here uh which is the the holographic
principle from physics and what the holographic principle says is that the total
observable classical entropy of a system is proportional to the size of its
boundary and uh one can infer from
that that the strength of the interaction between
the system and the environment is proportional to the size of its
boundary and the the the technical version is that the bits on the boundary
so the bits that encode the entropy um there're exactly enough bits
on the boundary to encode the largest igen value of the hamiltonian operator
that describes the interaction this a finite it's a finite kind of um discreet it's finite discreet
isn't it the geometry or the yeah right it's interesting the fundamental idea of
the holographic principle is that information exchange is always finite M
between between finid systems so if we if we now think of of
this picture in terms of interaction strength over on the left where the
communication channel is Tiny the interaction's extremely
weak and over on the right where the communication channel is enormous the
interaction is very strong and because the interaction is very strong
it it directly affects all of the degrees of freedom of the smaller
system and uh that's actually a condition that we call death yeah it I
was it crushes it essentially doesn't it yeah right yeah I mean the the environment literally invades your body
and interacts with all parts of it simultaneously and that's not good for you well can I have a quick question on
that Chris you mentioned bodies I mean do you regard the is is our body part of the environment
you know where is our where is our boundary truly is it the limits of our nervous system is it is it our mind or is it our you know because it feels like
bits of our body or at least part of the environment fingernails and so on you know they
well this this boundary is something that we have as theorists have
stipulated right so so if I if I think about me what I call me whatever that
thing is uh I can I can actually in theory at
least draw the boundary any place I want to And depending on where I draw the
boundary uh or where I draw a boundary I'm going to get different to
directions so if I draw a boundary that's
located 3 meters from the center of my head then most of that boundary is a
boundary between you know some air molecules and some other air molecules and there's not much going on there at
all so if I say that I am everything within that
boundary then my interaction with my environment is pretty
minimal uh you know I could also draw that boundary around you know decart's
favorite organ I could draw it around my pineal gland and my pineal gland is busy interacting
with my brain for the most part and it's exchanging molecules and and electric
fields and stuff like that with everything around it so its interaction is pretty strong uh it's not strong
enough to destroy the pineal gland thankfully um but he regarded that as
the the interaction seat between mind and matter didn't he that was the Locust of that intersection if you like yeah
right um and or I could draw it roughly at my skin you know I I can it's the boundary
is arbitrary in a sense okay the question is how useful is that boundary
yeah for for for describing in since the boundary fixes an interaction the
question is how useful is that boundary for fixing an interaction that's of interest for some
purpose for some explanatory purpose so if I'm doing cell biology I draw
boundaries around cells and I ask how each cell communicates with its
environment and if I'm interested in some functional Network in my brain
then I draw a boundary around you know the Salan Network or the default Network or some other network I say how does
that Network communicate with its environment or I can draw a boundary
around my brain or my liver or whatever yeah and say what's that what's that
interaction what's that interaction like could you do it with with say personality could you stick a boundary
around your personality um maybe you know I I if I think of it
as um some kind of interaction pattern some
sort of dynamical uh pattern that's implemented over time by
some collection of degrees of freedom in some abstract space then yes I can draw
a boundary around that pattern in that abstract space and say how does that
pattern interact with the other degrees of freedom whatever they are in that
abstract space and in the case of Personality I'm not really sure what
that relevant space is U you know you've talked with Mike
Levens so he's probably talked a lot about this notion of of multiple spaces
that one can be one can use to describe organisms yeah you know transcriptome
space or morphogenetic space or whatever and those are all interesting constructs
that we've come up with conceptually uh and there are probably lots and lots of
others but uh our our ability to to
probe these things and really understand what they're like is very limited yeah and that reminds me again
of the scale Independence thing you were talking about and also another question I had which I sort of put to Carl and I
think in some sense he said that the you know is almost um by definition but I wanted to ask you about the
applicability of some of the um sort of physics is information processing and the testability of these models you know
um and you can we use this stuff to do predictive uh modeling of of the world
yeah um you know Carl Carl has talked about
the f as a as a mathematical principle and uh I I like to formulate
the Fe as the claim that any system that persists through time will act in a way
that enables it to persist through time yeah yeah so it's it's obviously a
topology formulate it that way but it's undeniable right right yeah so so it's
it's just a matter of of of what these words mean words like boundary and
conditionally statistically independent and so forth once you once you explore
the meaning of those words then then the FP is obviously a good thinking
tool and I I would say the same is true for the interface theory of perception right if you think about what
does it mean to interact within an environment while remaining distinct from that
environment then the interaction has to pass through some sort of boundary yeah
and yes what the information that passes through the in that boundary is the
information you get and if there's information that you know is swirling around outside that
boundary you don't have access to it well that just is the interface theory of perception I think that's what Chris
if I may say I think that's why find so beautiful and elegant about this stuff is that it's it's like you're chiseling away all of the assumptions and getting
down to the absolute nuts and bolts and and you presumably are saying something
about the world with that yeah I I think what
On's what one's saying about the world is this is the situation in which
observers find [Music] themselves and
and to go back to the to one of one of your very first questions that really is a philosophical
question what what is the condition that we're in as cognitive
systems and I think that's that's the question that these kinds of formal
tools um is answering are are answering
yeah cool we um we we we sorry do you have something else I was going to ask go ahead what do you think about
Consciousness just ask the straight question um you know what have you got
on that uh I suppose I would characterize myself as a fairly inveterate pan
psychist right okay
and because when I think of a system
myself included which is interacting with some other system and
environment uh what's happening you know it's acting on me it's it's giving me
information uh it's it's writing some some data on my Markov blanket that I
assigned some semantics to yeah and uh
then I do some processing and I and I write some stuff on the marov blanket
myself and and that's the information that I'm sending to it to my
communication partner out there that's the rest of the universe and it does with that
information whatever it wants you know I don't control what it does with that information in the same way that it
doesn't control what I do with the information it gives me and again that's just what condition
statistical um Independence means which is the assumption that we've
made about this boundary being kind of a Goldilocks boundary that leaves us some
some internal degrees of freedom so what's my relationship
to the data that's written on my markof blanket which from a physics point of
view is just a bunch of bits what's my relationship to those
bits and I think the most natural word to use to describe that relationship is
awareness I aware of those bits right they're doing something to me Mark s
says you feel them you know right I yes I feel them they're a difference that
makes a difference to me yeah and that's that's it isn't it yeah that that's
beautiful actually a difference that makes a difference I've just wrapped my head around that now yeah that's really cool oh and
and some of those are are are bits that I have to have I can't live without
right some of them are the actual thermodynamic energy that I use to to
operate my body to to run whatever cognitive processing I
do and I have to have that right or or I fall apart yeah even perceiving cost
energy doesn't it right right absolutely so and all of this action that I do on
my environment I mean a lot of the action that I'm doing on my environment is just dissipating
heat that's that's action of me on my environment too so
um the way I would respond to your question about Consciousness is at the
most fundamental level uh it is just the feeling of receiving
information from the environment and the complimentary feeling of giving information to the
environment right we feel actions and
so that leads me to this is action or information sorry Chris well
uh I would say those are are almost the same idea right in in physics action is
a defined term and it's the product of energy and time so if I expense of
energy over finite time I've made an action yeah and if I if I'm writing a
bit on my boundary you know think of picking up a pen and writing a bit on a
piece of paper you're expending some energy in finite time m
and the the fundamental limit of how much energy I'm expending to to write a
bit in a way that for me is irreversible is given by landow's principle it's log 2
KT uh and I have to spin some time to do
that right it's a process that has a beginning and has an end yeah and in
fact it's it's that requirement of writing on the
environment that forces me to implement my own internal
clock forces me to have some experience of time that's I'm using the word
experience here fairly Loosely but it forces me to uh
be able in a sense to record the passage of time in my own structure so so what what would you say
so there's have you heard you've come across the term specious present so the kind of almost like a length of a moment
for us you know right um I just wonder what are your thoughts on that is that something to do with um you know is that
is that a measure of the volume of information that we're receiving or you know the density of information or something like that yeah I I I would say
at some fundamental scale it's the um
the length of the minimal time window in which we can act right yeah because
everything's an interaction isn't it actually again yeah yeah yeah information is interact it's it points
to what you were saying earlier about fundamentally it's about communication right yeah between agency
presumably and there that that reminds me of a question for you actually Chris because um there was I've seen quite a
few of your talks online um and in one of them I think somebody asked you could you have a a Cosmos or a cosmos without
agency and you said yes it's conceivable but nothing would ever happen right right I love that and in a
way I think in some sense that points towards perhaps sort of talks to the pany panych this idea that there has to
be some kind of agency in order for anything to happen have happened at all right right is that do you stand by that
I mean have I understood it first of all and do you I I I I probably actually quoted the Talking Heads right in in
that great band there's that wonderful song yeah yeah yeah love them
so think about what it means for something to happen if we think
about an isolated system in quantum theory and we view it as an isolated
system so we don't we don't try to draw any boundaries in it or anything else then it just sits
there and it has some State Vector in its Hilbert's B
and the state Vector just sort of roams around the Hur space right it rotates the only thing that changes it's
its phase uh and its phase isn't an observable and since we're talking about
an isolated system there's no one around to observe it so so this is a situation where um
one can say nothing is happening and it's certainly the case that nothing observable is
happening so now suppose I I now theoretically right I'm stipulating
something here we have this system that's isolated and we think about slicing it
with a boundary right now we've created two sides that can
interact and if the boundary is such that the two sides are conditionally
statistically inde dependent then this interaction be can be characterized in in terms of
information exchange now something's happening right now we have two
observers and they're looking at each other so they see a lot of information
flowing in and they say wow I'm getting information from someplace some
something must be sending me information so um this idea of
conditional Independence the idea of a boundary or a markof blanket or an interface or whatever you want to call
it uh and the idea of interaction uh as information and
exchange all go together they're all essentially the same idea and it's it's
that idea that expresses something happening something observable by
something and that reminds me actually um Chris if I may um I saw a talk with you and um josa back and Mike L I think
it was a few days ago so um you know right go guys go and watch that it's fantastic but Jo josa said um SpaceTime
is when you squint at autometer I thought that was a really
really cool sort of CH crystallization I think of his thinking but could you maybe unpack that a little bit for us and I I think you I think you um bought
that I think you're on you're on board with that um so could you talk a bit about why you're on board with that what it actually really means and yeah just
exing your thoughts on that okay well let's let's go back half an hour ago you you you asked something
about objects and we never actually got to answering that question what's a thing what's a thing yeah so suppose I'm
an observer I I've got this boundary and I have this environment and the
environment is constantly writing stuff on my boundary and it's the stuff that it writes on my boundary that I can see
I I can't see its internal states by definition that's what it means for them to be internal yeah and I can't control them
but I do have this constant play of data on my
interface and so suppose that um that
data is not just noise suppose that I have sufficient
processing power to say oh the value of this bits correlated the value of that
bit over there and so if I can identify some
islands of of coordination that are reasonably
stable and I have the processing capability
to uh lock in on that and and give that island of stability and name
basically then I can keep track of the history of that island of
stability and I can try to build a theory about how maybe that island of
stability interacts with some other island of stability are they are they correlated some of the time and
anti-correlated some of the time and um does it look to me like changes in the
thing I'll call a u have some effect later on on the thing I'll call B and
vice versa so can I can I see them talking to each other even though
they're just bit patterns on my boundary so if I can do all of
that I can say oh those are two things in my environment yeah and um I can
describe them by markof chains right they're just bit patterns yeah so the so
matrices sets of numbers right right right um so that's that's why I responded uh
positively to to that remark
that what my physics my theory of the world ends up
being about uh is well let's go back to
the fvp for a second what's my job as a as an active inference agent it's to predict what my environment's going to
do to me next and that just means to predict what I'm going to see next on my
boundary um so if I have a bunch of of
patterns that I call Objects then predicting what I see next
on my boundary is predicting what those objects are going to do next well that's what physics as
four right so physics and and Science in general
becomes an attempt to describe what I see happening on my
boundary and the objects that it describes
are the patterns that have some
stability yeah uh on my boundary and some of those patterns are other people
right yeah and some of those patterns are tables
and chairs what I call tables and chairs etc etc so Don Hoffman makes this very
provocative remark that neurons don't have any causal power because neurons
are just you know things encoded on my interface and um he's he's making this
same kind of remark that you know my my job as an active inference agent uh
isn't to know what my environment's doing yeah it's to know what my environment's doing to me yeah
yeah and again just I I can't help but be reminded of his conscious agent Theory um that seems similar to some of
your position in that it presupposes no manifold in which the agents exist it's
just you could imagine it as kind of like a Twitter verse almost um sort of interconnecting agents that and um yeah
yeah s yeah yeah I I think
um I mean I think one of the hardest things to wrap my head around there is the idea of a Timeless realm and
obviously Donald talks about these non- entropic Dynamics I I can't wrap my head around that to be honest Chris but and
also um KL suggested that you I think You' suggested that time is emergent as well so there isn't even a an underlying
chronology underneath um you know to space and time or emergent phenomena is
that is that is that fair yeah I think that's fair I the the
notion of emergence however is is different in the two cases okay or the
or shall we say the the the formal mechanism of of emergence is
different in the two cases so we talked a moment ago about action and about writing bits on the boundary and about
the fact that that doing that uh or having any memory of doing
that being able to to write on my environment right on my boundary and and
go back to that place and have some reasonable
uh assurance that what I wrote is still going to be there right it's like writing in my lab notebook I I expect
that what I write there is going to be there tomorrow and that the world hasn't come and changed it while I wasn't looking we
we all make that assumption um
if I'm able to do that then I I have to implement this clock and the writing
process gives me the ticks of the clock right every time I write a bit there's a clock tick yeah say I did that now I did
that now I did that so I as an agent acting on the
environment uh have to implement a clock I have to be a clock
in part and the clock that I am defines a
time errow for me and my my time Arrow points through
my boundary because I'm acting on it so
there's this directionality and we can view time is running in either direction we can review view time as
moving from me into my environment or I can think of time as moving from my
environment into me because I you know it's writing on my boundary also and I
see those bits as perception so that's kind of arbitrary you know which which way is Future and which way is past uh
doesn't matter but once we fix a direction then
um the the past is the previous Tex and
they're recorded by writing on my environment and a way that I can read and uh the future is where
information is coming from so you saying that we're not really in a temporal sort of domain it is just
almost as a manual caner gested like a kind of mode of human perception essentially yeah I think it's more
General than than human perception I think that every every piece of the
universe implements a clock yeah you know its own clock that's that's
relative to it it defines its own time era so what would you say just more
generally then what is a mind Chris
oh oh I
think in some sense you've kind of implicitly you've already kind of implicitly answered it in some ways haven't you but I just wondered if stay
clear yeah I'll be I'll be a bit provocative here I I think a mind is a story that we tell
ourselves my my mind
is a representation that I construct of and identity and a set of
processing capabilities and a set of past experiences and all of that yeah
and I construct all of that when I need
to not not necessarily all the time
uh you know I'm very interested in these flow States and meditative States and
and other states which are not self-conscious where this this story
about personal identity is not being told so in a sense this this notion of a
mind is not being constructed m but if you stop and think about
um me as as an agent and having done this and and you know having to ask
these questions and uh investigate these things Etc then one is telling the story
of of a mind yeah and that's oh what I
think a mind is a story that's really interesting because that reminds me of something Mike Levan said about this is
well I I kind of asked the question slightly differently I said what you know what is a human identity and um he
I can't remember the name of the thinker but he quoted some guy who said that thoughts are thinkers right so James yes
that's it brilliant thank you yeah the guy who offered up a kind of definition of intelligence as well which sort of my seem to subscribe to but um you know but
actually that that got kind of creepy for me in a way I thought that you know so people that have perhaps unwanted thoughts and sort of uh you know certain
mental health conditions and so on and so forth that there's a sense in which those are competing agents actually
within this you know within our minds if you can put it that way um and and I
said so what's the identity and he said well you know what the homonculus I said well that's just another one of these
stories that kind of anchors all of the other stories together somehow um am I
making any sense yeah yeah right yeah I I think you're you're both capturing his
thinking correctly and making sense wow that doesn't happen very
often thanks Chris but yeah I mean what are your thoughts on that you know because that's obviously got massive
implications for the an understanding of of human personal identity you know big area in
philosophy right right um well I I basically think Mike's right about
that that um you know we
we can have and there are people who who
have a very detailed notion of of who they are and what they are and and what
their past is all of that and uh people
who don't have a very detailed notion of it and uh people who perhaps have
multiple Notions of it you know I I have a colleague who says that she lives kind
of multiple timelines simultaneously and I can't really make sense of that but w
you know that's her report of her experience um so there's some dissociation within her own mind if you
like they different identities essentially uh yeah probably um you know she seems perfectly
happy with that way of being so
uh so you know I think there's a vast range of possible experiences
here and some of them are are deeply U disturbing to some
[Music] people and and this is a real question that I have is uh what's
the what's the range of what we could call neurodiversity or cognitive
diversity and how do these various conditions
um relate to function and what's how do they relate
to uh the emotional experience of of people who are who are having
them you know and I I suspect that
um there are experiences that make some people extremely
uncomfortable and that other people view as an achievement
[Music] yeah depending on your point of view um could I ask sort of just popped into my
head actually what are hallucinations and you know given what we're saying about our sort of apprehension of the
external World we're saying that it's kind of like a negotiated impression right essentially on sort of um sort of
screen of perception should we say um so hallucination in some sense is still
just that right and so you know if we're going through if we you know
so basically if I if I see lepre corn in some sense that's still real isn't it it's yeah if if I have let's let's
yeah break that down that's you yeah uh reformulate this and maybe less uh or in
more neutral language um suppose I'm kind of rolling along
and I suddenly have an experience that's completely unlike the experiences I've
had for the last few minutes M and then my next experiences are rather like the
experiences that I had in the last few minutes except for this
one then I'm gonna say well that was odd you know this is a a a massive spike in
my variational free energy um what's going
on and so I can look around the world and there may be some reason that I had
some that odd experience um but maybe I can't find
one so it's just an unexplained odd experience so I tell myself some story
about it you know uh the environment did this to me for
some reason or something along those lines um you know I I I dropped a bit
somewhere in some computation things went things wenty wire for a couple of
minutes but um the bottom line is I don't know what
happened right there was some big violation of my predictive model and then it
stopped uh touchwood and I don't know
why so I suspect think in some sense I'm sorry annal Seth the the S of British
neuroscientist says that everything's hallucination and you know he says that what we're just the whole thing is
hallucination what do what do you think about that um well it may be that the mechanism of
hallucination and the mechanism of perception are the same I think
what what causes us to say oh that was a Hallucination is that it's not
expected and once it's happened it isn't explainable
or the details weren't explainable so you know we go to sleep at night we have
some dreams and we sort of expect to have dreams when we go to sleep we sort of expect to
weird um and it may be that we have a certain amount of difficulty sometimes saying
you know did this happen or did it or did I dream it um but we're not all that shocked
by this fairly regular nighttime experience of having greens but if they
uh if stuff like that happens while I'm you know driving home
sometime then that's kind of disturbing and I say oh what was
that and it's it's then that we use words like hallucination and I think we use them
to indicate our
surprise and our ability to our inability to come up with an explanation
right cool um could I ask what you think about did I um Mark SS told me a little
story the other day he said that Thomas Nagel um declared that um Mark s's
Theory Of Consciousness was probably on the on the on on the right track or at least one of the best attempts at it so
far and I just wonder what do you think about the Mark s's theory of the reticular activating system being the
seat of of Consciousness I mean how what are your thoughts on that if I
may well I certainly find his um data about lesions in that area
inducing irreparable coma and his his um experiences with
uh uh what would it be a corticate uh infants very compelling yeah uh I saw one of his
talks about a year ago and just why you can interact with them but they've got no uh cortex is
that is that right right you know they they basically have a brain stem yeah and a little bit of of midbrain I I
think you know enough to have an igula that sort of thing so they can experience
emotions effective it's effective isn't it so no higher cognition they they feel
you know right and uh that's I find all of that very
interesting I mean it's it's it seems completely clear to me
that in those individuals something's going on right there's some awareness
something is being felt yeah um even though there's there's none
of what we would call cognition going on uh let alone what we would call
metacognition so there's not a mind right there's there's not this this
constant story about them they're not telling a constant story about themselves right they don't have um
memories they can't they they they by definition I mean that that equipment is
missing so there's no directing sort of we might say homonculus perhaps but and
and of course I think Mark SS likes that in a sense he says that you know because perception itself isn't aware is it
right you know that they are kind of Sy they Information Systems right it's the thing that looks at the screen of
perception that is have you know is that you know and um so that that's kind of his answer for the homonculus problem
isn't it say well the homonculus is this affective State that's um that's brought
about by the reticular activating system I mean that that's that's phenomenal in a way isn't do you feel like he's sort
of gone some way to solving the hard problem though and then he surprised me actually by saying that he was very sympathetic to some of the idealists
thinking he was actually quite sympathetic to the likes of castr and Hoffman as well because I thought well hang on if he's located a seat of
Consciousness doesn't that make him a physicalist but of course not he says he's a jaspic monist you know so um I'm
bloodly confused Chris I think what are your thoughts on that
well that's that's a very complic multi-dimensional question you got 10 minutes right I me I
think Mark has very carefully
localized a region of the nervous
system that is essential
for what we call awareness at the
or what we call human awareness right
um there's there's some system
in say those even in a coma patient that we could draw a boundary
around and say that system is quite
aware of the heart rhythm and it's actually monitoring the heart rhythm and
respond into changes in the heart rhythm but that's not human awareness that's
that's not what we regard as our awareness it's the awareness of some you know gangling in the in the brain
stem so Mark has very carefully
circumscribed a part of the nervous system that's that's a necessary condition for what we regard as human
awareness and
the word Consciousness is very often employed to indicate much more
than that basic state of of of emotional
arousal you know it's it's often used to indicate um narrative metacognition for
examp example yeah so the the field of Consciousness studies is full
of uh ambiguity and
um conversations going out at Cross purposes because the basic words mean mean different
things uh to different
users so setting that kind of of linguistic confusion
aside if we ask about the hard problem in the formulation
of is this system aware of anything at all is there anything going on
experientially then I think we have to say that um
Marx uh aortica patients are aware of something or
other okay yeah uh even if they have none of what we would call
intentions yeah he said you could tickle them and they'll respond you know there an effective B yeah right
there's an effective response yeah and we can certainly do that sort of
experiment with many many organisms and get some kind of response
and that's why I'm very sympathetic to this New York declaration about Consciousness for
example uh that if we think in these very
Stark uh is is there any experience at all
terms then I think we have to go very deep and once we go very deep in in that
way which is kind of a
oh an empathetic or or kind of compassionate
way uh then the theory that we use to describe these systems tends to force us
to go even deeper know um people like gayen strawson
followed that path I think very eloquently 20 years ago so I don't think any of what I've
said about radical pans sism is it all
new whether that has anything at all to do with uh the sort of materialist
idealist debate isn't clear to me I mean it seems to me that when one thinks in
terms of things like uh objects are emerging uh SpaceTime is
emergent uh semantics and all of this stuff is Observer
relative then the materialist idealist debate is sort of dissolved
anyway and I not clear how how that debate gets any traction with that that
Observer relative kind of view of things and you know even without a sort
of substance Claim about you the nature of reality you can crack on and do the science and you know free energy
principle anyway can't you you know it's almost to to some degree perhaps doesn't matter um yeah maybe maybe um yeah
that's really interesting um I had another question not sure how we're doing for time uh few minutes are you
you good for a few more minutes or sure sure sure okay I was going to um just sort of perhaps go even more sort of
abstract and fundamental and say what do you think mathematics are and why do we
have this thing that gives us this means of identifying regularities in the
world what you know what you know the Mike Levan example of the normal distribution that emerges from dropping the balls and where is that stuff why do
we get it as a free gift that's a that's a very good question and and
yeah that that is a question
that I wonder about out oh
I'm 30 years ago maybe uh Lake off and Nunes published a
wonderful book called where does mathematics come from
and in it they outlaw outlined um a theory of
mathematics that was is U very much based on metaphors of
motion and if you think about uh abstract
mathematics things like category Theory or even abstract algebra you express
many of these relationships by diagrams that with you know circles and arrows notation yeah
you prove theorems by by taking your finger and moving along the diagram
seeing if everything works so um you're kind of enacting this kind of metaphor
of motion as as mathematical relationships as metaphors of motion so
I I found this very compelling this idea and if one looks at what's uh lit up in
an fmri scanner when people are doing mathematics you see a lot of activity in the motor
system and the motor planning system okay so that's interesting seems
to be some um sense
to the notion that when we're doing mathematics uh we're
actually doing it as a metaphor for motion or a metaphor for
manipulation uh so we're moving through space we're moving through space in some mad sense while we're doing it and we're
and we're moving objects from one place to another you know we're saying you know what's the relationship of this set
to that set well there's some arrows and I can think about you know moving this little ball over here and this over here
and putting it next to that one and you know it's it it all seems very
performative uh very kind of motion oriented and
so when you ask what is mathematics it seems to me like it could
really be an abstract encoding of our Notions of space and
object hood and identity and all that stuff
and at the same time it looks like it's this gift we get for free well some
sense you're saying it's about walking and running and jumping right yeah yeah that's F that's fascinating yeah I think
that's certainly what l n would because the human body has to do a sh a shedload of mathematics to be able to propel a
ball you know through Stadium sort of things so is it a glimpse into that in some sense you know I at least I don't
find that um what's the right
word I don't find that imp plausible I think it it could very well
be that we get this for free because we are you know embodied agents and we do
have this kind of inactive form of cognition I mean this whole story about
uh objects being uh patterns of correlation that we see
on our on our interfaces is not a million miles from things that you know
machon and verela were saying in the 70s or 80s
so um there are a lot of threads leading into this way of thinking from various
historical ineds and as you said earlier some of these problems go back as far as ancient
Greece you know right so you and and was it um who was the guy that said that everything we're doing now is just
footnotes to Plato was that a whitehead wasn't it it was whad but um Chris
appreciate with the the end of the 90 minutes there so do you want to keep to time should we should we stop it there
uh yeah it's probably a good place to stop actually um it's I mean I've a lot of fun thank you very much this was I
really enjoyed this Chris and um yeah I got tons more questions for you so maybe you can come back one day in the future and um thank you so much for spending
the time with us okay well thank you cheers Chris take care yes cheers bye-bye
