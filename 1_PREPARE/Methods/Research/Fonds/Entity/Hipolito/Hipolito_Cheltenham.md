Asst Professor Inês Hipólito interviewed by Matt Gray


hi inz hi Matt thanks for joining us um got
quite a long and complicated introduction for you because you're sort of very very accomplished um so if I may
um so you're assistant professor at Mercury University so philosopher of mind and AI which is just infinitely
cool um you're the first proper sort of professional philosopher that we've had so um we've had you're our seventh guest
and we call ourselves philosophers but you're like the first kind of proper professional one that we've had I mean I know the other guys are capable
philosophically but you're a proper paid philosopher so that's really awesome um you've got so many letters after your
name it must take up the whole envelope for your mail right so you you've got B Phill Mill MSC and Dill so you got ba in
philosophy in 2010 um MSC in philosophy 2012 and MC in cognitive science in 2015
and that was at Kings College London is that right yes yeah was was KL friston
there where during that no no Carl is in uh UCL oh that's right yeah yeah yeah
thank you yeah yeah um I I worked at Kings College London with the NHS a few years later um but yeah um you've got a PhD in
philosophy 2020 um so you're you're a real expert of this stuff right um you've got 19 research Awards including
prestigious Talent Grant from the University of Amsterdam co-founder and vice president of the international Society the philosophy of Sciences of
the mind and that must take up tons of your time you're an elected member of the women in philosophy committee and
the committee in diversity inclusivity at the austral Asian Association of philosophy how did I do so um that's
that's that's fantastic sort of list of accolades um but could we sort of go all the way back and so so how did you kind
of get into philosophy in the first place why was philosophy important to you and why did you pursue it with with such um
rer right so I have to say that I was um I grew up in Portugal and uh Portugal
has got this quite uh peculiar uh one of the best things I would say about Portugal is that uh philosophy is
actually a a mandatory subject in high school right so all yeah so all students
stents um will graduate with three years of of philosophy uh regardless of what
areas of study they're at um so during those three years things changed a
little bit for me because I always thought that I was going to do something either in the Arts or I was going to do
something in Psychology and and and then during those three years in philosophy uh that's when
I realized with the help of my very good uh teachers at the time they were mentoring me uh that uh philosophy was
actually more in line with the questions that I was asking and I was interested so that's how I eventually moved from
Clinical Psychology which is what I thought I was always going to be uh to uh philosophy and then not really
knowing how things were going to go just taking one step at a time really and at
a time I had very little very few people around me that were philosophers so I was really going blind in this journey
and uh looking back I'm really happy that I did so um could I ask if I may
what what were some of those philosophical questions that you had that weren't being answered by the Arts and perhaps by sort of Clinical
Psychology what was it that was kind of giving you the philosophical itch yeah so of course uh there are many questions
I remember that the first book that I read was uh also spoke zaratustra by n
so that was my very first introduction that's one to start with isn't it I know isn't it and and uh that was my
introduction to Western philosophy actually I was reading simultaneously Buddhist philosophy and Western
philosophy starting with uh also Spokes atra and I remember at the time being so
excited about it that I was just like right so then now what I'm going to do is I'm going to gift to all my friends a
copy of this book because they need to to read it so this was con them yeah convert
them yeah exactly I just like no one can go through life without reading this book that was my that was my take from
Al spokes atra um so then I was reading this um boast Western and Eastern
philosophy at the age of 13 or 14 and trying to like sort of like do already something that I didn't know at the time
what it was but it was something like comparative analysis comparative dialogue uh between these eastern and
western and I was finding some some cues um especially with with with nature um
and budhist philosophy of mind so it's really fascinated about it all and then I I just this is the age of 13 14 and
then by the age of like 16 17 I land into philosophy as like a subject a
serious subject um and I get educated in philosophy so I already was coming in
with like some questions of my own and some interests of my own and one of them
that I remember vividly is uh was the question of uh whether or not one could
have an objective perspective of the world so it is a quite fundamental question in philosophy especially
philosophy of Mind philosophy of perception epistemology but of course I didn't know any of that at the time but
but that's what was intriguing me was whether we could have an objective perspective and then I would come to my
philosophy teachers and they'll be like that is not a Clinical Psychology question that's a philosophy question
does the patient exist you know but uh so what what did you what were your
views at that time so when you I mean that's crazy that at the age of 13 or 14 you were looking into the intersection between East and West I mean did you get
into Alan Watts or or any anybody like that or did you of course I mean he's what he like yeah he's a hero of Mine
He's just freaking awesome isn't he I love Alan Watts right yeah what were your what were your yeah sorry did you
what were your views at that time did you have any met metaphysical sort of suspicions about you know the nature of reality and what were they very
rudimentary I still I still think that I have very entary I'm I'm I'm always very
cautious and humble to go and step into that territory um but um I suspected at
the time as I suspect now is just that now I have uh a more robust toolkit to
navigate these things that I didn't have at the time but at the time I suspected
that it wasn't possible to have that kind of like uh objective perspective of
the world it was quite humbling and still is right um it's it's it's it's
quite important to I think to realize that once you realize that then humility
comes with it because then you realize that your own perspective comes uh with
limits right very viin steinan limits of your world right so uh once you realize
that then you realize that all of the problems that come with understanding other the people
miscommunication communicating uh yourself right uh your identity your
thoughts right so once you understand that perspective that is limited and it's not objective then even our
scientific practices might or should become more humble because we understand
there is no U direct access or grasp of um uh an objective reality even though
ideally U science Endeavors and scientific ERS would would would really like it can the world be intelligible
without this objective perspective you mentioned I think so uh I thank God for
that I think that it can I think that it can and um it's important to notice that
when I say that we have a limited perspective to the world I am by no
means saying that this perspective is indirect right so this is important
right I'm by no means saying the perspective is indirect I am saying that my perspective is direct is just that it
is limited by the limits of my world in a very fit consent sense but I'm not
saying that I don't have a direct perspective to the world so that's my perspective it's it's my point of view
towards the world right so then how are we going to build um an
understanding of the world right and what's the world well the world is these things that everybody from their own
perspective is going to look at and realize patterns right that's what we do
we kind of like realize these patterns from our own perspectives of the world and I think that we should talk more
about perspectives rather than perspective we should talk more about knowledges rather than knowledge because
there are different ways in which we build knowledge depending on the stances and the perspectives that we come from
and this comes in layers and that's what's so interesting about it is that there an individual kind of like layer
of a perspective that you can look at the world and build you know your understanding of the world right which
is distinct from you know your peers around you right but then there's another very interesting layer and that
other very interesting layer is the community level layer right so the inculturation right so the ways in which
my perspective is not just mine and my own it is fully permeated by the my own
inculturation right so the kind of like fully per fully permeated absolutely and
we have I've found a paper with Sean Giga and Daniel Hutto in case we want to
you know know more about like that perspective on that which is precisely about um uh uh
enculturation and um how how cognition is permeated by inculturation right so
that's the thought it's just that not only there are the limits your perspective is limited by your own world
which is the conjunction of all of the past experiences that you had but then
with this added layer that those past experiences that you had plus this present that you're having is not
encapsulated of or a view from nowhere right it is profoundly situated in a
social cultur community that you've been um navigating
uh and being educated and contributing to as well through the cultural
practices contributing to the cultural narratives or maybe challenging them so either reinforcing challenging them so
that's the thought is that there are these multiple nested multiscale lay layers um that would really put you
precisely situate you um in a specific stance of your own perspec perspective
and that's the beauty of it because you give that contribution to the world because only you can have that stance
and that perspective only you can and at the same time it is limited because we need other people's perspectives and we
need to communicate these perspectives and see whether or not we can reach something that is a description of uh of
a phenomenon of of common interest is um I'd like to think in some way philosophy
is about that isn't philosophy about sort of trying to transcend that inculturation and say
something that we can agree upon that that can actually be demonstrated using logic and reason and so on and so forth
and you know that's something I've always trusted in you know I believe in reason reason has the power to deliver some sort of truth right and um so is
that what philosophy is about in a way do you think yes so there's so much to say on that uh that I'm jumping out of
my seat um what to say first yes uh absolutely so philosophy is about
critical thinking and it let me just at this point it has always been important
for us to be extremely strong in critical thinking but I suppose that uh
in today's um in today's world of AI even more than so but I'll just at that
side comment and uh go to yes philosophy is indeed about uh critical thinking so
reasoning reasons for acting reasons for thinking that something is the case
that's critical thinking and the there are a set of conditions for critical
thinking to be really successful or more to deliver a more robust kind of like
outcome and one of them um that kind of like relates directly to what we were
just talking about stances and perspectives being limited right one of them
is that um one should uh sort of somewhat U Get rid of our self right
somewhat set aside as much as possible our own
personal agendas right such that we can think critically uh without uh those set
of perspectival biases that we bring to the table so that's something that we
should um that we should try to put ourselves in that kind of position to think critically um such that we are not
serving um our own um perspective and biases so critical thinking is important
to achieve something that and now here I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to talk about
philosophy in the same ways that wienstein understood Philosophy for those that are listening to us and and
are um also um into fitan science philosophy then there's some map uh that
we can relate to what I'm saying so philosophy's goal is not to offer
explanation of the world because that's a scientific goal um and the thought
here is quite interesting because it's just this quote by vonstein which is
just not everything that can be known will be known through the through
the through the the scientific method right so knowledge does not come down to
the method of the scientific method there are other important techniques for
us to um to elucidate States of Affairs for us to understand states of Affairs
what does this mean these means that some questions we may have right some
questions we may have one cannot go around and set up an experiment to find
the answer for it right it's just not possible right and I I would I would
just like bring up the one of the most philosophical questions of uh The Human
Condition which is like question about like for example the the existentialist Human Condition and those kinds of
things we really cannot get just go and set up up uh an experiment in order to
you know answer those questions this just means that there are certain questions that are profoundly
philosophical and we cannot answer them through the scientific method we need to use reason right we need to use critical
thinking right so that's philosophy that's where philosophy lies because because sometimes it's hard to let at
where philosophy stands uh in comparison to science and it's really easy when we
don't understand the role of philosophy and the importance of philosophy it's really easy to downgrade it and to think
well it's not really scientific is it it's just ideas isn't it what we forget
is that if everyone is running experiments and models then there's no one else left to do the thinking and
here I am borrowing this perspective from from uh from Von nman who was a
computationalist and a mathematician right and he had exactly that thought if everybody's just doing experiments or
model or computational models there's no one left to do the thinking so this is what we need right this is the gift of
philosophies to provide those kinds of like pristine clear descriptions of
phenomena that then scientists can work with and go oh okay all right we can
pick up this and pristine that's clear we can pick up this and it's going to be very helpful to to inform the design of
certain experiments or to interpret the data that we collect and you know surely
a good scientific theory Sure should give you its ontology as well so it should tell you what it's about and and
in order to do that it needs a kind of metaphysical description doesn't it so so again and also Mike Levan said that
philosophy was important so so there you know but but no um the other day he was um he was saying that look you know they
have kind of Workshop philosophical workshops in their Labs where they just they ask the Deep questions and say well
you know let's test whether this system has cognition or not like you know and so philosophy does have a place in
science doesn't it and it's it's crazy to think otherwise um I believe so yeah yeah on board with that um
so that's really interesting thank you um could you talk a little bit about the free energy principle why it's important
to philosophers and why it's important to scientists and could you kind of Rend
in such a way as to make it easy for some of our um viewers to to really get their heads around it finally I think I
have now I reckon but don't test me on it but yeah if you could give us a just give an overarching view of um frist's
free energy principle why it's why it's interesting and useful and um yeah over the
end right okay so there are there are different ways to go into the free
energy principle and understand it um I prefer One Way rather than the
other right is that the for the high road yeah yes yes I prefer
the high road uh hugely uh by comparison to the low road
and I'm really glad that um that the free energy principal Community uh has
uh sort of like conceptualized or given these two parts to understand the free energy principle uh they are extremely
useful right and I encourage everyone to understand them because really really is
going to allow you once you understand these two parts this is really going to allow you to then understand much of the
literature in free energy principle in philosophy of mind so I want to preface
by saying that understanding the free energy principle in itself even if one is coming from physics from mathematics
it's hard um and then coming from philosophy it's going to be hard again
uh one needs to really Master many different fields at the same
time to understand uh the free energy principle and there's so much there that
can be unpacked I find the free energy principle and this is just a preface to
it um I find the free energy principle to be really interesting in the sense
that it really genuinely organically invites all the different scientific
areas plus philosophy to come together and think about this thing whether one
is on board with the with the free principle or not it's not the relevant point that I'm making the relevant point
that I'm making is that it organically invites Explorations that necessitate
this inter disciplinarity to come together in dialogue and I really really enjoy when I work in free energy
principal papers where it is genuinely a a an interdisciplinary team where
everybody's got a role and it's really important that everybody's there so that's what I enjoy the most I think
it's that human factor of like discovering and creating and co- constructing knowledge that really
requires this interdisciplinary uh coming together to really uh do something and take the theory forward or
the framework that's that's better I put uh forward right so this is to say that
um there are I find again to go pick up on our conceptual toolkit from from
critical think from philosophy that philosophy is critical thinking what it's about well it's about giving
reasons for why I think that something is likely to be the case so there's
something is stronger or some theory is stronger than another to explain a certain kind um so what I find in the
free energy principle is that there are reasons that lead me to think that it is
a strong framework to understand certain uh phenomena in the world right so what
do I mean by this I mean that I find that it is is it is a robust um
computational model it's a robust uh uh uh systems biology
neurobiology uh framework to understand um systems
biology and and I will say how what I mean by that I I don't think that and
sometimes I'm asked well if if the free energy principle is a theory of everything I don't like like I said I
think that there's a scientific um there's a scientific Endeavor that is going to give us so much and there's a
philosophical one that is going to give us so much the outcomes of these two are different so we're going to have a
description going to have explanations right so this is what we get when we apply the free energy principle to
understand some phenomena in the world like it can be cognition it can be a
biological system it can can be a a social system it can be an ecosystem so
I can apply that framework to understand or to
generate um uh um epistemic virtue in terms of pattern of dynamics that exist
in the world right so things that exist in the world and I can map them down and
Trace them down or track them down with this uh framework that is going to in
the end give me an outcome that is epistemic virtues and uh hopefully it
will allow me to also predict future states of the thing right it allows me
to do other other other things but I'm just going to stick with this for the moment and then philosophically speaking
uh what the ways in which philosophy would come into this story is that it
would provide me a description of the phenomenon let's say that I want to use in a very practical sense because I am
very practical about science I think about science as a scientific practice right so in a very practical sense I
want to design a model to understand a certain cognitive phenomenon right um so
what philosophy is going to give me is it's going to give me a pristine hopefully a pristine a clear description
of that cognitive phenomenon right so what are the factors that are there in
that cognitive phenomenon making it what what it is right and and what is it that stays out right what is the description
of that cognitive phenomenon and that is going to be very useful for me to then go go around and about and develop and
design my computational model because the thing is we we shall not make
mistakes the computational model is um profoundly leveraged off the ground with
a bunch of assumptions we have to because why do we use and develop a computational model well it is because
this is a certain thing that that has such high level of complexity and degrees of freedom that we cannot go
around and about and set up an experiment that's typically when we use computational models it's because we
cannot experiment it we don't have the tools so then we have the best the next thing which is a computational model
which has got its own limitations of course uh specifically because it doesn't have the same degrees of freedom doesn't allow us that um so then in that
sense because I'm I'm setting up an experiment that is a computational model and I need to come up with certain
premises that are going to serve as assumptions to leverage my model and then run it right hopefully ideally I
would have uh I would be informed by a very clear pristine uh philosophical description of the phenomenon itself
such that I have a clear mind on okay what assumptions are going to be in place so this is a way in which things
work together right and the free energy principle um and active inference is
going to be I think for reasons that I can I can I can I can unpack and expand
on uh is going to be relevant and interesting because it allows us to
capture a fundamental aspect uh that being informed by by by philosophical um
uh Endeavors in philosophy of mind uh specifically e cognitive science those
coming from there um that's at least the one that I find strongest um being informed by that then the free energy
principle I think becomes very appealing from from an epistemic or or as an
epistemic tool in the sense that it allows to capture a fundamental aspect which is the coupling the vital coupling
between an organism and the environment and what is really really interesting there what it rejects is the view that
there is an encapsulation of the system from the environment right so these that I've just described is somehow the high
road there's way more to say but I wanted to just for for for for for
audience that that knows about free energy principle um I want to say that these are the way in which I described
is a high road rather than the low road in which case things are slightly different and I'm happy to discuss that
just a Dar question on this um The Narrative at the moment seems to be that it is the convergence across the
disciplines that leads to some of the the really deep insights right and you know success and progress and and
pushing forward um so could I mean so so in some sense there is just one science
you know right and and you know could could the free energy principle be that unifying sort of language that allows us
to you know sort of just describe any Dynamics without these you know kind of artificial
boundaries and does that question make sense um
well the the do the goal of um a principle almost like the Lord of the
Rings uh ring to rule them all um I'm
not yeah I'm not entirely sure I think that there are bits and pieces um of the
puzzle and different principles and laws that are that that work for us and should work for us or at least they work
for me as these lighthouses right you have Newton's Laws um so you have energy
principle right so um these laws and principles they are profoundly informed
by mathematics right so they should serve us as lighthouses and that's kind
of like my my take on the free energy principle is that in principle right all
open systems in principle everything that is an open system right and we can
we can impact that by by by determining what properties are of the open system but everything that is an open system in
principle um however I will find it in the world is going to be behaving in a
certain way that is compatible with what the free uh energy principle says Okay
so this in principle that's going to be the case now when that is not the case
is When Things become very interesting and we need to study them H so you see I
look at them as lighthouses and the fenergy principle is interesting from U
uh systems biology perspective because it allows me to look at the ways in which uh a certain open system there is
a a living system in this case but we can also talk about how the free energy principle allows us to understand the
patterns of dynamics that are not living systems but specifically on the systems biology approach um now um regardless of
the scales really I can look at how a cell is in a Cell tissue and I can
through the patterns by employing this uh framework I can understand or reach
the conclusion of whether or not this cell is adjusted to the cell tissue
right so it's it's it's healthy and adjusted doing what it needs to do given
the State of Affairs which by the way I as a scientist I am the one that has the overview of what is going on and the
cell is profoundly integrated doing what it needs to do right um so from that
point you do have sort of like this Lighthouse that that shows you or tells
you like in principle the law is in principle the systems that are living
that are open systems they are uh engaging in a behavior in principle is
according to the seemingly pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics that
they do not want to die right whatever it is that you're doing doesn't matter whatever it is that you're doing it is
very very likely that they are pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics right and it's already profoundly
something that I didn't have before right so then once I see things like that I'm like all right so when I see a
system that is not really doing that that's interesting need to study what's that case right and then eventually
hopefully line we'll have some biomarkers um and some points in which we can U that we can use for for
treating at a different scales that's fascinating could we could we have a quick look at the low road or
or um oh yes absolutely can we have a quick look at that because um right so then um the low road
um would be closer uh to the analytic uh computational uh
philosophy of mind uh and that's there's there's a vast literature on that um in the last
few years and that that would be the take that um so it's on on the on the
philosophy of Mind side it's very close to computational theory of mind um there
is a special issue that I edited with uh Michael kof and in the introduction that
we wrote uh we lay out how um the visian
brain um is not that different from other competitional theories of Mind
such as the modularity of the Mind in case somebody wants to uh go and have a look on on the argument there for for
that uh so that's why I'm like I'm I'm formulating in terms of like DEC computational theory of mind it's with
that uh with that argument in mind that um we can we can pack it up in computational theory of mind so on the
philosophy of Mind s uh the low road is quite where we find the computational
theory of Mind literature and on Neuroscience wise are the high the low
roads to the free energy principal or active inference is where we find um the literature on predictive
coding so predictive coding coming from Helm holds uh the mind or the the brain
as a predictive machine that's the dep part the departing Point that's the first premise right the first premise is
that um the mind or the brain is a computational machine so then what you
have is theart from this premise and then what you have is different theories
that are going to differ only in the ways in which they Define
cognition they're going to differ in the ways in which they Define cognition so let's say that you'll Define cognition
as a transcribed to the brain right so then you find theories
that are for example prediction error minimization right so that's for example
Yak of ho stake and in his paper 2016 paper in now it clearly is very clear it
says that we can throw away uh the body the world and other people because
cognition comes down to the brain Network right so then the brain uh is that Central A system that U issues
predictions and and generates understandings about world sufficiently right doesn't require body the and
generates the self as well generates generates the self the self is the highest model that's that's exactly the
theory right so then again the definition of cognition is here what is the element that is going to really
differentiate this different philosophy of Mind computational theories of mind right so then you have cognition is
within the the skull Within the brain where even the the the the the the the
relation between the brain and the body is that the brain predicts the states of the body and the body is part of the
world so that's the kind of like in a you see the body the body is part of the external World in that view yeah right
okay okay yeah precisely so that that is why the predictions are the predictions
that the brain issues about states of Affairs are states of Affairs are outside of the brain and what is outside
of the brain is the body so even even the body is going to be uh predicted uh
by the brain right so that's cognition defined within the skull right that's
prediction AR minimization Theory and then you have for example the the the radical predictive processing like Andy
Clark's version of it right and what Andy does is he brings in and says no no
wait a minute the body comes to do a place comes to have a role here uh
cognition does not come down to uh the brain but the body plays a role and you
can find this I think in its most articulated form um and clearest form in
in his paper radical predictive processing from 2015 and um he explains it quite clearly
there that in his view um the body serves a role in cognition right um and
this role he calls it embodiment but it's quite important that we we understand that this embod ENT is not
the same kind as let's say phenomenology m h kind of like embodiment it's not
that kind why is it not well because even the if the body even in in for any
clock is going to be a part of this predictive system is just an expanding
of okay cognition does not reduce to the skull cognition is the brain and the
body right so it's a it's a that's Andy clar's embodiment so cognition of what kind of these predictive processing kind
so the body's part of this predictive processing kind in his view what is's applying is something that is called and
well known which is uh control motor theory and what it what it what it does
in very very simple terms is that um there are predictions that are issued down the body and the body sends up
update so the body is part of this predictive system that's that's the radical pred processing
view quick question quick question in there sorrys I just want to wrap my head around how this predictive processing
model accounts for the continued sort of homonculus if you like you know that that thing that's inside the theater of
perceptions and how how does it account for that if that if that's a persisting kind of just self model of some sort but
I don't know can you say a bit more about that yep so that now that's that's
a criticism to these to these theories um which which um which which I think
that that is a strong criticism in the sense that there there there are strong reasons to to to to think very carefully
about that criticism and take it very seriously because as we were saying uh
before when you mentioned about the self and I said the self being in the highest model right so that's precisely it so
when does that end right because then you have this Cascade of uh of models that go up and up and up but you kind of
like there that's the criticism that is made that you always need another model to make sense of the previous one right
so then we have we have a an add infinum uh necessity of a model that understands
the previous one right so that is a criticism uh that I think we should take
uh very carefully and that criticism applies and I think rightly so to any
Theory it regardless to any theory that begins with the premise that that there
is an no access to the world that the world is indirect the access is indirect
so any Theory it doesn't matter if it's a computational typically it is but any Theory uh that one can think of conceive
of formulate that where where once one departs from The View that living beings
are somewhat encapsulated and because they are encapsulated they need to
create mental models of whatever kind of the State of Affairs right then
eventually you will end up in the imas right because you're going to be like okay so there is something in the brain
that is making sense of the world out there but then I need something else that makes sense of that something else
at infinitum yeah so once you start with a premise that um there is an
encapsulation and we need to create these mini mental models reconstructions of what is likely to be the State of
Affairs eventually you have to respond to the Ulus it's interesting just just briefly
because Mark SS was we were talking along similar lines the other day and he was saying that sort of Consciousness is
that thing that selects between the different inputs and makes a decision as to which to PR prioritize you know
obviously he he locate it within the what was it the reticular activating system that's the that's his seat of Consciousness what do you think on that
just briefly if we could just just take a brief detour into that I mean what do you think of that cuz cuz I thought he
was a physicalist cuz I thought well you know he's locating it with within our physical bodies but he's not he's a dual
aspect monist and what are your thoughts on that view just if we could just take a brief side side
tour a brief just two minutes yeah a brief just
moving on to right so I am I'm extremely humbled by um talking about
Consciousness so you will find me typically talking about um psychological
experience and cognition and those kinds of things when it starts getting conscious Consciousness uh typically I I
I I move away because I'm incredibly humbled and I don't know how how how um
how well I'm going to do on that I really need to think that very very carefully but um I can say what I do not
think that is reasonable in the sense that I cannot find reasons to overcome
challenges that are well known in the literature by people that you know we are sitting in the shoulders of giants
right so by people who came before us have been thinking about these philosophical questions uh very
carefully right so the dualism aspect um or the dualism
take or Pathway to think about these things I do not find appealing because
of several different uh problems that come up reasonably speaking um but one
particular one is mental causation right so that so the thought there is that it's
the explanatory Gap and it is the mental causation gap which is the thought that
the more you open this Gap right the more difficult it is going to be for us
to reasonably close it right so that's why I do not tend to go towards the the
approach that takes a dualism perspective and there are different ways of you know taking the dualism pathway
um there's the property dualism which may be where I think that's where um is
but I'm not entirely sure about that um but even the dualism perspective needs
needs to be kind of like closed and until now um so far we' have not been
able to to close that I do think that there are very good
arguments uh made uh by Dave chmer in at least directing
directing our attention to raising this awareness which is exactly what puts me
like kind of like in this humble position is because I am am very mindful
of those notes by by by David Chas about the fact that many many times in
Neuroscience we claim to be studying Consciousness right and that's this what
the study is about but then it is actually a study about attention right
so so there are many ways in which we may uh be claiming to be studying Consciousness but then actually we are
studying what David Shamus calls easy problems and then there's nothing easy about them of course there's absolutely
nothing easy about them it's just that they are neuroscientific problems problems that we can set up an
experiment to understand them right or we uh or we are very aware that well I
would like to study Consciousness we don't have the tools so let's just study what we can study which is like
attention and other sorts of like factors that are are going to be relevant for Consciousness right or we
take them the feet kind of like approach which is like well we do not have that capacity um to study um Consciousness at
a moment and that can be and here comes Dave chala's kind of approach that can be because the tools for scien ific
research are not the tools that are going to be the ones that we need to understand Consciousness right um so
there's there's a bit there and I think that you know um I think that if we are
to at least make some progress in understanding where we are in these three options and or a different one of
course um this not not exclusive uh if if we are aware of that right I think
that we are already making progress as FL phers and as scientists do you have a hunch or any
intuition about the nature of Consciousness uh well a hunch a hunch
would be an inclination would be that um that these different scales and
levels of a systems biology approach right um would scale up from faster uh
Dynamics to slower Dynamics so from the most uh uh minimal uh forms of life that
comprise a living system to going scaling up uh to the highest level which
is the fully embodied agent that level that has experiences and is
communicating things like us right um so I would say that I tend to be inclined
to this emergence kind of perspective where we go all the way up and all the way down
and it's there it's just in more rudimentary ways or in much more
prominent ways uh like the ones of the fully embodied enculturated agent like
us that can not only have that experience of being alive but because through in culturation right has been
able to develop like languages uh that allow them to make
sense uh uh think um and communicate these psychological experience that
they're having I was thinking about language the other day actually there and I came up with a completely novel
way of thinking about words it's probably not novel to clever people like you but I said um to myself look it's
almost like words are the sort of surviving um sort of psychological state in a way aren't they they're they're the
ones that sort of won the battles inside individual human minds and then at the sort of more Collective cultural level they've won that battle as well so
there's like sort of
yeah so language is so the words are almost agents themselves there's some sort of agency about the words themselves sorry yeah yeah absolutely
and um the languages that uh we have developed uh and created uh they are
themselves Dynamic right they are not just like this like um sense and
reference or at least I don't take it to be in the very fer um kind of like way
of understanding language right they have this sense um and reference no
they're quite Dynamic and why are they quite Dynamic it's because they depend it depends on the use right so languages
evolve and they're profoundly um being shaped and shaping our cultural
practices so languages are not the way that I see them they are not just this
kind of like monolith um encapsulated again code that
we just use as code right so ues are dynamic in the sense that they are uh
shaped and being shaped by our cultural practices so the meanings of the words
are going to evolve and modify and being extremely um dynamic in that sense and
again I would report back to wienstein and and and and and just to make a this
point that um language is uh the means
by which all the confusion emerges but it is also the means by which we can
dissolve confusion right and that's why philosophy is in his view seen as a
therapy right because you can through these engagements in language games
which are Dynamic again they are social cultural practices a language game is social cultural practice you can through
the engagement of these language games uh you can to solve confusion and that's
therapeutic that's why for him philosophy was a therapy right it's because all confusion comes up but also
that's the Hope in language to the solve that confusion so these then Maps upon
something that is way more recent in the literature uh which is this book um by
uh an activist such as the PO and colleagues which is linguistic bodies
right so the thought there is very ginan as well because the thought there I
would say um because the thought there is that we are not living beings that
have come to be able to master this this monolith code uh in the sense and
reference of fra sense and reference kind of thing no we came with it we came with it right we are the exactly exactly
so we are instead these linguistic bodies where the ways in which we communicate are of course uh going to
have be permeated and populated by these semantics which are going to be uh
sensitive to the use that we are giving it as a social cultural practice right
through time right um but in this communication it's not just that's kind
of like communication of that monolith code right um there is more there is
this aspects of the communication that make make Communications what they are in which like subjects that are
communicating they are co-constructing in a very embodied way that scene that
is happening right there right now so it's not just a communication of like um this robost kind of like ready to ready
at hand um code but we are co-constructing and in doing so in
continuously engaging in these kind of like social cultural practices where language is in included in that right uh
then uh we are co-constructing the social cultural practices that in our communities that we live
in that reminds me of a question from earlier actually so sorry we're darting around so forget the structure right but
um how do we we were talking about inculturation right and having sort of language that's you know just infused
with some of the cultural training that we've been through right how do we know what is and what isn't how do we distinguish kind of clear non
enculturated thinking from culture you think or is that or is that even possible so remember back so that takes
us back um to the question that I had in high school if we can H ever have uh an
objective perspective right yeah you did say that right so then if we so
basically the thought there is that you cannot decide uh we can try in a very
intentional way when we want to engage very seriously and intentionally in critical thinking we can do an exercise
of trying to set aside who we are right such as to engage like very
very seriously very very intentionally on thinking very carefully about a topic
even if the outcome of that thinking does not serve our biases that's the best that we can do right it's that
intentionally trying right which is why uh critical thinking is something that
it's not does not come naturally it's really really hard it requires practice
like uh for you to become extremely skilled at it in the sense that any other skill requires like becoming
really really good at riding the bike it requires you to take you know intentionally going to ride the bike and
you know do that for for for a long time or becoming like a super master in karate or or in dance or something like
that critical thinking is the same it doesn't come intuitively we tend to have thoughts that serve our benefit right um
so they are self-serving right so then we really have to engage in it as a practice in order to have some Glimpse
on what it would be uh to have a perspective outside of our own
perspectives and what is self-serving right um so in that sense that question
brings us back to whether it would be possible whe it is possible if we engage
intentionally in that as a practice Through Time right to to do that through time not once not twice through time
that's what it means to be a philosopher right is to intentionally engage in the practice of philosophy setting aside um
that those biases you've actually got to do it right um yeah can I just
interesting question on that so so this idea of um reason and critical thought right so if we could could get the whole
world to reason critically in a perfect way right or near Perfect Right would we all agree on
everything we we I think I think that we would
agree on more things um so there's this
there's this phenomenon that I'm absolutely fascinated by um and I will bring it up in any opportunity that I
can um because it is it is a metaphor to the possibility of philosophy right the
possibility of philosophy um what it done as a practice right as as as
science I think so I also I also think about science as a scientific practice um so philosophy as a practice hopefully
eventually will give you that Forest View of things where you can lay them
out clearly have the topology there is a description and the best description is
the one that uh is not very challengeable from a reasoning perspective right people agree on that
the ideal of philosophy regardless of what's the topic of analysis that we are really
trying to get at right the ideal is when we do have a topological map that
describes things in such and such and such a way that we kind of like can agree upon right and and gives us a
chance to then zoom in on on on those regions then doesn't it breaks it down exactly but at least you got you got a
map to start off with right that people kind of like agree upon that is undisputable or very little disputable
and then what you can do is you can get science to come in okay now you can come in science and you can like zoom in into
different aspects because we got the good map now so that's what we as philosophers need to do right but
sometimes we get distracted but that's okay so I think I think of philosophy is a
practice right of that that's the goal is to get to that map right but to do that we need to really scale and Elevate
and get what now I'm going to give two different analogies I'm going to give the wienstein in one and then I'm going to give my one so wienstein would call
this working our way outside of the bottle showing the fly the way out of
the fly bottle so there are many different bottles and the bottles are different theories out there and you're
going to be in one You definitely going to be in one because you've been inculturated to be in one so you cannot
goes back to the question that you were asking we cannot just decide oh today I'm not going to be inculturated in the
way that I am can't just decide that you have your way reverse engineer your way out
of the bottle such that you get to the Forest View where you have like different bottles so to speak right so
that's the wienstein view right we cannot just decide that today I'm going to go into the lab and philosophers are
lowering the Rope into the bottle for the scientists to sort of come out in the way and I mean philosophers are inside
the bottles themselves right ideally that's the therapeutic aspect of it is
that you understand then that you are inside the bottle free yourself that's the therapeutic aspect of it and you you
reverse engineering by going back through all the language games that got you into that
bottle so that's the therapeutic right from vste right so then you come to have
this Forest View perspective right which is where you want to be right um so
that's when you really set aside all your self-serving thoughts right and so
that is a perspective that would allow you then to have like a closer to be
closer to having an objective perspective of the world right
um so okay and then once let's say that we meet there right let's say that we
meet there and once we meet there there are really opportunities for us to discuss ideals without being inside our
own bottles like my theory is better than yours kind of discussion right um
so that's that's that's fitkin science analogy and what we should do as philosophers is find our ways out of the
bottles by reverse engineer the language games that got us inside that bottle in first place and then what I want to say is
that I really like uh this um these studies on the overview effect I find it
absolutely extraordinary uh it's a a very unique case that only a few have
the opportunity to experience but is um INE equivocal uh evidence for and and I
think that even from a theoretical perspective it makes perfect sense why that's the case right so when astronauts
go out in space right and they are in their little big spaceship and they see
the pale blue dot as Carl San would have it right they see the pale blue dot and
they become extremely so there are many reports on that um and I'm always delighted to read those reports watch
the videos it's absolutely incredible that perspective right so that's the perspective that we need to achieve as
philosophers and as scientists so what happens is that you are outside and you look at the pale blue dot and all of our
little um human civilization dramas are the opportunity
that comes with it is that it's put into perspective right where for the first
time you are outside of all your bottles m right and you look and you have this
tremendous opportunity to look from above and to see how everybody is in
that pale blue dot right and to see how small the reasons for Wars and all of
the the the things in which people disagree will look like so that's the perspective that that comes with being
outside looking at the pale PL do and Carl San's work has really really helped
getting the planetary perspective that we all belong to this planet that
we need to take care of so a whole other perspective comes and that the requirement for that unfortunately is
that we get out of our situatedness of our inculturation right all of the language
games that we live by uh we get out of that perspective such that we achieve this other perspective that is going to
give us a much clearer non-self serving view of the
world do you think there's something sort of Pandora's Box about philosophy I mean how do you think it affects the
philosopher sort of having these insights into inculturation and language and sort of does it cast any doubts on
your own sort of um view of your own identity and things like that because it sure does with me and I just wondering
how how it makes you feel being a philosopher do you ever sort of wish you hadn't opened the box
Sometimes some people say uh ignorance is B right
um I think socres Socrates said it wasn't so yeah I I I I think I think I wouldn't
have it any other way no I'm sure I wouldn't have it any other way than what I have it's fun isn't it it's actually
really good fun yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure um this is um I think that now
I'm thinking about existentialist uh philosophy because of course there is
most of my work has been on phosy of mind and cognition and that brings us very close to neuroscience and brings us
very close to science in general right MH and there's this other side of philosophy that is the one that really
impacts me the most as a human being right um which is all of these
existentialist uh traditions in philosophy um in in the west and in the
East and uh those are I think the the big Human Condition kinds of questions
that again we can authenticity and things authenticity and things like that yeah
exactly so what does it mean to leave a a life that is that feels right and good
right so those are the Nord Stars those are the the the the the the lighthouse
kind of questions that are at least in my life that are the most interesting
and and relevant and impact me the most uh in my life of course that the work
and my research on um on cognition and the ways in which we try to understand
cognitive phenomena by by looking at what reasons um would would would would
help us think or would lead us to think that that is the case and we can describe cognition in such and such and
such a way and then we can build this and this and this and these experiments to understand whether that's the case of
course that is also uh very uh relevant in the sense that as I was saying before we can set up an
experiment uh sorry we can set up a um a computational model to understand that
cognitive phenomenon uh in particular but there are limitations to it in the
sense that what we will attain ideally and in the best case scenario what we will attain is a an understanding and an
an ideally a prediction of state of future States right about those dynamics
that are very uh kind of like from a very systems biology approach but it
will potentially tell me absolutely nothing as to why um the person in on
the agent uh level scale now um behaves in such and such and such a way right so
there's limits to that computational model in which case then I need to bring in the philosophy because they start to
be uh kind of like more philosophical questions about psychological experience right so why is someone choosing not to
eat when that is not pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics well maybe
that's because they are on hunger strike and here is where we kind of like need to bring in these descriptions of State
of Affairs that that sort of like computational model will not you know give us as a commodity right we need to
bring in now Machinery con conceptual toolkits and Machinery that is coming from the more agent level analysis of a
social cultural in situated actions that would explain us
why would that system not be pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics why is it increasing uncertainty uh for
its own existence right and becoming closer to a phase transition such as death so that brings me to um questions
about artificial intelligence you're obviously an expert on that as well right um so where do you think we are in
terms of the field of AI how close are we to um AGI um and sort of super intelligence
and things like that and and what kind of world do you think we could be living in there's a few questions sort of in the next um say 10 years you know um and
um you know presumably you don't think that chat GPT has any form of sort of knowledge inside it
right no um I don't I don't think uh I don't think so um do you think they ever
could do do you think you know a server box could ever have feelings
okay no that's not possible because the question that one needs to be asking is what are the conditions for the for that
for feelings what are the conditions for a system to be cognitive what are the
conditions for a system um to have psychological experience of whatever kind right so however we answer that
then we answer the question for Char GPT right the thing with Char GPT to put it in very grief right and to situate it in
philosophy of mind is that Char GPT may act as or we can look at it as a a good example
of John cel's Chinese room it looks like it behaves like it
but it's not right yeah so but there are even
more layers and issues with this this is just you know for starters of of the conversation for mapping that with with
the lature it's almost like CH GPT arrived now a year ago and um and is
showing us what the Chinese room was like what it is to have a Chinese room
because it's again the Char GPT is going to raise uh different conceptual
theories and toolkits and and conceptualizations to Old problems right
so this is an old problem it's not new it's quite fairly similar to when we had
you know the touring machine it's quite revolutionary in the same kind of sense
it looks like it but it's not so it's another yet good example of um the
Chinese room uh large language models in general and generative AI they are they
are they could be said to be calculated for words and there's a reason to you know understand them in that sense
because um they are predictors they are just really really really sophisticated
uh predictive models right with with with with inference uh probability um so
that's what they are and and I know that some arguments are being formulated into
thinking that uh large language models um the way in which they behave would
seem like they would be conscious right and I I just think that couldn't be further away from you know uh the
reality than what it is right uh because the idea there is just that once we understand that they are Absolut
abolutely extremely dumb then we would not want to be caught up in saying something like that right
we talking about highly sophisticated um predictive uh
probability right so the inference probability so in that sense um what
they have is they have these context Windows of a limited number of a
monolith of words that they use as tokens without understanding of
semantics they what they're going to tell you is in the past right these words and words and words within these
context Windows have come together in this such and such and such a way right
so there are profound issues uh with uh using chpt in ways in which we want to
use it as knowledge there's absolutely nothing about knowledge there and the reason for that it's because large
language models have no access to the reality of anything they just have a
context window of tokens that don't don't even understand what they are or
whether they have any kind of like contact with the reality right um so
they just those monoliths of what's sitting there and then the risks are tremendous because we interact with it
as if they were such engines as if they were going to give us facts as if they were going to give us knowledge and
there's nothing more dangerous us then not using our best critical thinking to really hold on take a moment and be like
what am I doing because the intentions in which we engage and the outcomes that
we wish for as we interact with large language models uh might be completely
fled in the sense that I'm expecting if I'm expecting it to behave as a search
engine and to give me facts that's not what it's going to give me because it's not it doesn't have that capacity right
it's sitting in this digital Dimension that has no access to the reality so in
a way you can see it as calculator for words because it just calculates within a certain space right it's going to
calculate what is typically coming together in that space now what is typically coming together in that space
just to allude to uh another high risk is that most of these data sets are
Western data sets right so it's to give you the perspective of the West and we
shouldn't forget that the West is 19% of the world of the cultures in the world
of the cultures the knowledges in the world is 19% right so this is a problem that that that is known in Psychology
very well known which is the weird problem in Psychology which is like we have WR written all the books textbooks
in psychology on the basis of 19% of the population so the West uh is the
population that has been studying um uh um in Psychology so we have the same
issue with these large language models where the perspective that it's going to give you is a perspective of the West so that's one way in which biases are um
coming in and then people interacting with this um knowledge generators which
are not right is going are going to receive this kind of information and reinforce it as well yeah and absolutely
reinforce it and take it as factual when it's absolutely not just a monolith of
these data sets of words sitting digitally without any connection to the
reality um and giving you in the past uh
the likelihood of some things coming connected connected with with with others it's like a useful tool if use
correctly right so that's that's the point uh so then uh the question is going to become uh how do we determine
uh good use or productive use or an effective use of large language models I
would think about it as something that like riding the bike so of course we do
not get born riding a bike we need to learn how to ride a bike we need to understand where we can fall right we
need to understand where the dangers are and what we don't want to do um because otherwise we fall right it's going to be
dangerous for us um to ride the bike um not in a skill skillful way so then we
we we continue practicing and continue learning um to come to briide the bike
really nicely and effectively right so with large language models um it's the same kind of thing there are certain
uses that are going to be very effective and they're going to be um useful um but
most of them are not and the condition for them to be useful and effective is that we need to understand what they are
and and once we understand what they are they can useful to do certain things for
us but we shall not expect them to give what we typically are expecting a search
engine to give us um because it's going to be it could be furthest further away
from from from what it is that's that's really interesting um so how close do
you think we are to AGI and if we are close to it what does it look like
and you know what are your views on the definition of AGI so following war was just saying on
um on large language models not having touch with the reality right living in
this like kind of like digital space where they are almost you can think of
large language models as maps with no territory right right so once you think
that there's no touch with with with territory right there are maps that you can navigate as you interact with large
language models right you interact with them as you would interact with a
several of with a with with several different maps that come together right and they live in there um with that like
kind of like monolith of like tons of maps and you are his Navigator like
trying to navigate these different maps that have no territory
they don't have touch with the reality they have some kind of like semantics that you can interact with right because
you understand that that kind of like semantics you understand those linguage Linguistics codes and and words and
those kind of things but they kind of like living in this space that they do not have a territory right because they
do not make those links they're not such engines right so then you can interact
with them in a certain way for the purpose of something else you want to do with your life so there's a task that
needs to be done and you interact with those uh maps with no territory to get a
task done right now imagine the risks in that right to to to interact with maps
with no territory where the only link is you right you are the only one that can make use intentional use of for a
certain kind and then put it to use there's something that um people don't realize is that from an Ethics
perspective and from a law perspective Ive as well you are responsible and
accountable for anything that you generate and
use with a generative model with large language models you are responsible and
accountable for anything that you generate and you put tou your name know that didn't know that yeah whoops so you
are and and and this is from an Ethics morals perspective as well as as things would get more complicated
from a law perspective right so this is what companies uh involve companies that
integrate AI or companies that developed state-of-the-art AI need to be worried about is that let's say that I Implement
that I use I'm going to use now uh the free version of CH GPT to help me decide
on um applicants uh to a job right and then the thing is going to
give me a rationale that is going to look very human like even though it doesn't have any touch with the reality
um is going to give me rational as per I should I should hire candidate a and
there you go I have that rational um and then if you are asked to justify why you
hire that um that uh applicant rather than a different one right um You cannot
you cannot say well because charge it you told me to right you cannot delegate that responsibility right this is your
responsib have to own it so whatever it is that you take out of this interaction
with these large language models to act upon the world you own it yeah you be
accountable for it yeah you can't blame the hammer for for knocking the nail in you know exactly so that's the thought
right so you're going to be accountable in that sense right now going back to saying that these are maps without
territory that do not live in our world right we are that the ones that are going to do use with that whatever
interaction that we had that's why we need to be extremely aware we need to educate ourselves into understanding
what these things are so that we understand the position that we are at when we pick up things from that those
maps and then use those up those things to act upon the world right um so once
you look at um large language models as these maps with no territory what's going to happen uh is that you realize
that the the the the thoughts of of
Intelligence being some qu qualifier for for large language models are very
limited right because right because they are what they are right they are these
like incredibly vast large language models that have like many many if you
would like many many many Maps within it um but these maps are maps with no
territory so then could these be thought of as a form of intelligence when they
on on their own they do not have that touch with the reality and so you know a typewriter
doesn't know what's being typed on it you know it's similar sort of thing um so what
but what about um you know um Advanced general intelligence is that the no sorry artificial and general
intelligence that's that's a new thing isn't it that we're pursuing at the moment do you know much about that and where we are and can we do it yet can we
have super Minds so again you would
require as to this is where it's really important that people
take philosophy of Mind very very seriously because no notice how for us to answer that question we need to start
by defining mind so we need to start by why why do
we need to start by defining mind well it is because do that's what's going to give us the conditions yeah right so if
I'm going to ask that kind of question which are of course live questions um
today um then I need to ask okay so what are the conditions for something some
system to be minded right and then depending on how
I'm going to answer that question then I'm GNA have an answer for whether or not we are close or far away from having
a system that is not a biological system there is an artificial system that is
minded right so it's if you would the part from the computational theory of
mind and you say so I'm just going to run the the options here really if you the part from the computational theory
of mind and you would say that mind is a machine um that a mind is a processor of
information and then you can have like different theories that you have right you can have modularity of the Mind the
modules were the ones that were responsible for the computation to deliver AAL representation to cognition
to tach of belief so then you can run that or you can uh run all of the predictive accounts of of Mind where
mind is a machine of what kind all of of the predictive kind and then we have a variety of ways in which we can defend
that uh that pathway is there is there a prevailing is there a prevailing view within the philosophy of mind the
philosophy of Mind Community is there a kind of favored current view of and if so what is that
so um throughout uh the last 20 years the most pervasive account uh in
philosophy of Mind was the computationalist uh or the computational theory of mind um is very is very uh
fundamental um together with uh in Psychology cognitive psychology so they
come very much hand inand um and then you have uh these other in very
wellestablished and varied and reach uh e cognitive science which comes from
different other areas um that brings all of the different uh Pathways in an
activism together so you have this U that's kind of like the landscape um
right so then once you and and I'm going to go I'm actually going to end up there in this in this reasoning so then you
have that option where if the mind is a machine then um they'll get you very
very close to um playing around with the idea that large language models can
eventually be mind it because notice if you define mind as a computational
system what are the features of a large language models they are computational in
character right so now let's take it a step further and let's think okay now
let's define the kind of computational system that the mind is let's say it's
predictive right let's say it's inference okay so now you are even
closer to to to to jump even even even further down take a deep dive within the
bottle within the predictive processing bottle you continue to go down play the language continue to play The Language
game okay so then the Mind mind is a predictive machine right so then if the
mind is a productive machine then what is a large language model well a large language model is a predictive machine
it's a predictive uh probability system of the computational kind so then see
we're deep diving way more into the predictive processing bottle so then I mean I cannot reach any other conclusion
other than these predictive large language models of the predictive kind
are if they're not already minded they will be in the future as they become
more and more and more um uh let me just say this properly as they increase more
and more and more because this is all they can do to develop to is to increase more and more and more the context
Windows which means the number of words that they have to play around with and soak up more and more electricity as
well exactly yeah yeah and sustainability yeah that's that's the topic um but just briefly actually in is
I think do do you think that people get confused because they're neural networks they think well we've got neurons and we
have neural networks in the brain so therefore you know they must be conscious but I mean what what I don't understand is why people can't see that
look it's just they're just values in a freaking database somewhere and it doesn't even if you get another database to scan those values and tweak its
weights or something it doesn't make it conscious and people just get confused there there's a lot of confusion in this area isn't there I think yes and I I I
there was a a recent paper that I cannot um remember the title but I I did I did
post I did tweet it uh last week and the authors are brilliant and uh what they
uh clearly state in the paper and I was very thankful that the paper was out clearly stating that which is going back
to vidon sign through language all the confusion comes up and through language we can dissolve the confusion and I
think that being in that predictive processing bottle is precisely coming from the confusion of like this
interchangeably um using the conceptual toolkit uh in artificial intelligence
and in brain and mind Sciences as if these were the same kind of thing right
so then you use the same conceptual toolkit to describe these things which is a conceptual toolkit where the mind
is computational but then you now youve are you are within the bottle like diving real deep right and because you
have worked out that Lang that language game down and down and down and you are now fully immersed in this bottle then
you are coming to think that okay so if these are of the same kind of like the
computational kind of the predictive kind then there's only one reason reasonable conclusion to this way of
thinking to this rationale which is if they are not yet they will be it's an
old it's an old fashioned category mistake isn't it really I think so uh I
think so and and and and it comes from um in from using the same conceptual toolkit for both uh uh describing
artificial intelligence systems and the human mind and using the computational toolkit to describe a human mind um it's
interesting how the literature as has evolved into it came from V Newman using
um the computational analogy and then of course f using the computational analogy and what I find is that what started off
as an analogy and even not even V Newman wanted to say that the mind was ontologically computational it's just
that what happens through time is that it revolved to be an ontological description or ontological predictor of
what the mind is and that's a category mistake so then you are in this bottle where you've worked out all of that and
you stay there and you're diving real deep and now you want to think about okay so then what are the these large
language models well if they have the they share the same kind of feature then
if they're not minded now there will be in the future because that's that's conceivable given our rationale that
brought us here right so that's that's one way of thinking artificial
intelligence and Minds right then the other way and and recall that started by saying well it depends on how you define
mind really so that's where we really need to turn to philosophy of mind now and look at what you know all of these
people that have been thinking about these things for so long again sitting in the shoulders of giants um have been
have come up with um so then that's one possibility um then another possibility
and there are many other possibilities of course but another possibility is to say that well U cognition is not
computational it can be many other things right uh it's not
computational because uh one could say and I'm just I'm I'm reverse engineering
getting out of the bottle because when pressured one could say well it's not computational for sure but the
computational toolkit is useful right once pressured some have
have have come to revise and do that well it's not computational like really computational in the literal sense but
it is a useful conceptual toolkit for us to get a grasp and hold on the phenomenon that is so abstract right and
then some would push back and say actually it's not useful because look at what happens you continue with that kind
of like conceptual toolkit and then it leads you into thinking that large
language models are computation so is it useful or are we just or or are we just
under the illusion that we understand something and making progress into understanding something that we don't
right and then there are pitfalls that we may fall upon without realizing that that would be the only conclusion that
you would reach coming from that L language game coming from that rational
the game that you're playing so that's that's that's one thought um then would
be like a different rational like okay so the mind is not computational we may
use and this is the one that I would find most I would find stronger mind is
not computational um in the literal sense we use and develop because we've
been enculturated with symbolic structures like numbers ways of you know making inferences Concepts and and
thinking and so on and so forth uh by the inculturation that we've had um um
we've been able as a community of scientists um of technos scientists to
develop computational models that would allow us to make patterns intelligible
to make things that we see in the world that we don't understand intelligible right so that's the extension of our use
of our computational capacity and power is that computations are uh something
that exists in the world because humans exist in the world there is no such
thing as computation in the wild so computation is something that exists in
the world because we have come to develop sophisticated tools like we have developed other kinds of sophisticated
tools and large language models are a kind of these computational tools that
we have come to develop so that's the story that I find stronger what do you say to those
characters that think they have got some sort of a theory of the world then so um sort of take Steven wolf have you come
across any of his work lately so he's actually he's come he's come up with he's actually come up with what I think
he's describing as a sort of computational um theory of reality um
where he's showing the sort of SpaceTime is emerged he's he thinks he's managed to unify relativity and quantum mechanics and all this kind of stuff
with a well universalizing Theory and so I just wonder whether you'd come across that and I think he's actually saying
that there is a kind of finite discreet basis underneath all of this um but you
know I mean it's it's another case of you know if you know even if the model generates predictable results you know
it still isn't saying anything about the actual visceral fundamental reality is it exactly well it's saying something
saying something about it but definitely it is very very valuable actually we've
made so much progress in Neuroscience because these models are valuable and they're valuable because in epistemic
terms not in ontological terms right um so these these models cannot give us ontology I know that we would like that
but they will not give us ontology they will not give us a description of what the thing is that's ontology they will
give us an explanation of why of of causal relations which are going to contri rute
to help us um to help us uh uh uh um think about the the topological
descriptive maps that we build reasonably built right so they are very useful in the sense of being epistemic
tools that create and generate epistemic virtues and gains um to help us
understand so basically one can think of this philosophical topological descriptions and these computational
models explanations is together working for the understanding of a certain
phenomenon right so that's the thought now me would like to take a step further
and say well these computational models are also on onology predictors or
ontology describers right so they're going to give us the ontology and I think that that's again a category
mistake do you just think okay should we just get this clear do you think it's simply impossible to know anything about
metaphysics or you know to know anything about true reality you know in terms of
um you know kind of the underlying substance of it all if you like I know it's an oldfashioned term but can you
you know are you saying you because you mentioned Vicken Stein a few times as well and the thing is I've not read much
Vicken Stein because when I was studying un um philosop university I was encouraged not to do my um dissertation
on Barkley they were saying oh don't be dared you know idealisms been kicked into the long grass all of those kind of metaphysical problems have gone since
Vicken Stein are The Logical positivist right so so I I kind of I was turned off him a bit because that and you keep on
quoting I think I'm going to have to read some Vicken Stein and um and also I'm quite
interested in knowing what you think of his private language argument and does that really completely do away with solipsism once and for all so yeah do
you do you think that the um private language argument resolves
solipsism does it kick Sol solipsism into the long grass um yeah so it's it's interesting
because one of my favorite works by fit canstein is remarks on philosophy of
psychology uh it's incredibly hard to follow um but it's it's it's it really
gives you uh some interesting insights on the nature or character of um
psychological experience right and it really brings things into um thinking
about it in ways that are not in the depths or hidden into something else
they're right there in front of you all you have to do is notice which is why he brings in the the the the Duck Rabbit
image to explain what he's trying to get at yeah and what he's trying to get at
is that psychological life is not something that we have access to through
introspection because again um not how this is consistent with what I was saying earlier the world is
not I do not experience the world through an indirect access the world I
am in the world right I am my world the limit of my world uh is who I am is my
identity um right um and I do have a direct access to the world through that
that identity and I do have a direct access to that identity so uh if you
follow that line of reasoning um the features and the aspects by which I see
the world to go back to the to whether it's possible to have an objective perspective of the world well of course
it's not through these lenses um and that's precisely because the ways in which I'm going to see the world is
going to all the aspects that I'm going to select um to see the World by are the
ones that are defined by my previous interactions with Worlds the pns that I have observed um that have come to be
like very much who I am right here in front of you right so um those those are
right there in front of you and as vinai says in the same way that the table of or chair is next to you they are right
there um uh for you to see them to notice them and notice being the keyword
there for you to notice them if you wish to do so so it's not by virtue of an
introspective meod that you're going to have access to this depth of something that you are but it's right there in
everything that you do in the beginning was need as he borrows from go right so
that's the thought so you are in your actions uh uh all the aspects that you are are in your actions um uh right
there as you navigate the world right okay so then what is the thing that is hidden and this is the crucial aspect
right what is it that is hidden the bit in the Box etc etc etc that brings us to the language games and private language
Etc um so the subtle move there that is
really important to uh grasp is that my psychological life is not hidden to me
it's given to me right and like anything else because it is part of the world it's actually the limits of my world
right it's not hidden what is hidden is that my
psychological life is hidden to other people not
me right and the ways in which I can communicate my psychological life to
people is through language and that is not perfect because
through language all confusion comes up and confusion can also be dissolved
right language is not perfect but it is my best hope to be able to communicate
my psychological life like my identity my thoughts right so the ble in the box
is is this analogy where you can think about psychological life not as something that is hidden there's a bit
that is in the Box and there's a hole that you can look into and you have direct access you just
have to be willing to look into it that's it you just have to intentionally
notice the aspects that make you you you are right now right um so so then that's
the ble in the box I have fully access to it if I'm willing to look inside the
box right um now the ble is hidden to other people other people around me they
also have capitals in the box and I do not have access I cannot you know look inside those boxes I have to receive
descriptions from other people describing me they're bit right but I don't have a direct access and I could
never have because the limits of my world are limits are my world is limited by the experiences that I've had right
in the tract will say the limits of language but then of course we moved on to the second viin so I am taking the
liberty of saying the limits of my world are the limits of my experience the experiences that I've had um so I hope
that's okay um so so in that sense um you have a direct access willing you to
do so you have direct access to your your psychological life it's right there
right in front of you it's tangible if you're willing to look at it um the psychological life being hidden is
hidden to other people and that's where language can be useful to communicate uh to each other our psychological life now
this means that um this means that there is no such thing as a private language
because in this because we are going to co-construct these language games in
which we are going to try to get each other understood and convey ideas and meanings of what o o o of of our of our
own uh perspectives uh of the world so language would not make sense or would
not be something that would be useful if I would be living alone in the
moon so brain braining of that would never develop language exactly because
the language is something that is required for communities of understanding right for all of the
different kinds of Endeavors and tasks and things that we want to do as human beings it can be simply communicating to
you what it feels like to watch the sun rise as I climb the mountain the other day right it can be things like oh I've
I've got this this this I I've noticed these patterns in nature and I would like to understand and more about how
things work in the physical world in nature so it can be for scientific Endeavor so for epistemic communities to
negotiate the ways in which they understand a certain phenomenon uh in the world so language makes sense
because we are in communities that's the thought there so no such thing as a private language uh that's the idea
behind it no self without other um yes so appreciate we bit
stretch of time here so thank you so much for um spending the time to explain some of this stuff to us I'm still a little bit um fuzzy on some of these
areas but hopefully we can catch up again and and sort of delve a little bit deeper into some of this stuff there's a load of stuff we didn't get to but
hopefully we can we can come back again at some point absolutely thank you so much it's been an absolute Delight for
me me too thanks sinz take care thank you bye-bye bye
