It's for Luni Libes mostly to legitimise the AIME case study. Jack shared the future vision of the NATION which might come across as marketingspeak, but you know as well as I do, it's very very real!

Have also requested a look for you & Saskia for now under the hood :)

More about AIME:
    • Born out of Indigenous Australia, with 60,000+ years of imagination at its heart, AIME is an imagination lab to solve the greatest challenges of our times. Created in 2005 as a global social change movement fueled by imagination and mentoring, AIME has been alleviating inequity and now operates in 52 countries. You can read more about the scaling journey through the Harvard Business Case Study & Supplement on AIME.
    • The symbol of the movement is the iconic AIME Hoodie that connects everyone from around the world, and the underlying economic framework that underpins our entire systems is "Hoodie Economics" (a book on the subject is being released by Hardie Grant in Sept 2023). For traditional economic frameworks, there is also a KPMG Economic Evaluation (2018) into AIME that ascertained that for every $ put into AIME, $8.9 is returned to society, equating to ~$1.17 Billion worth of net direct economic impact.
    • Digitising our work over the last 18+ years, we are in the midst of launching a new digital nation, IMAGI-NATION, that centers intelligence from outside the margins into the mainstream systems design and activates humanity as a whole to healthier patterns synched with natural economies.
    • To model a healthy regenerative sustainable system, AIME has an intentional death date set for March 2033, after which we cease operations & return our IP back to Nature and the ecosystem around us. As a side note, we're currently raising $100M to fund our work for the next decade, and inviting systems thinkers and designers to partner with us to change the way the world works.
    • Our work specifically in centering the intelligence of youth from outside the margins has gained acclaim worldwide with AIME being recognised on Global Stages as one of the Top 50 Organisations in Education, UNESCO's Global Education Coalition, Fast Company's World Changing Ideas in Education, Top 100 Leaders in Education, and so on. 
    • Note also that our network partners include the Australian Government who celebrates AIME as a key case study of success in building equality, and global organizations such as Bloomberg, Accenture, PwC, Citigroup, Cognizant, Google, Virgin Airlines, etc. and our ambassadors & mentors have included influential people like the Mandela family, Dr. Jane Goodall, Sir Richard Branson, several Prime Ministers, CEOs and so on.
