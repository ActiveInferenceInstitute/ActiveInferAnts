Mentoring, key to a fairer world
Kabir Dhanji
“Sunday Kindness” has an established beginning that is this week forfeit, because there’s no
sense in conventional beginnings; they are always shifting moments that hold still long
enough for a breath, and then they’re something else, so there is no correct way for things to
begin. The same rule, or lack thereof, is the principle that conceived and founded AIME, so it
seems appropriate that this observance be upheld as AIME forges brave uncharted futures
fervidly laced with belief.
The precedent herein relinquished has been an introduction to who & what I am and how I fit
into this story, but that doesn’t matter. Instead, today’s words, in this space, belong to an
indispensable cast of librettists and correspondents and other scribblers, who have together
fashioned their renderings of the revolution that Jack Manning-Bancroft (JMB) set in motion
15 years ago.
Kabir and Jack on the road between Johannesburg and Pretoria, Africa, in Feb 2018
“Mentoring – The Key to a Fairer World”, which goes on sale today from the AIME shop, is
an essential collection of essays from individuals made up of Nestor pundits, a sprinkle of
tirelessly working AIME proletariats, and the unadulterated genius of hope conjured in a
brutal and spellbinding promise of dreams composed by mentees across the vast expanse
of Australia.
Most of what there is to be said is sketched in the essay below, “the lost chapter”, which is
best suited for the lunatics and the brave; the others may mistake it for a general order to
arm the bastions of tradition in their finest blimpish costumes to keep out the kind of heretic
that it contains!

Mentoring – The Key to a Fairer World
DREAMING UP AN IDEA
The ideal essay for this episode of pages is to tell the whole story as it is, and as it
happened, so that there is no mistaking the early way and the tempestuous inception that
bred the foundations of what prevails today. However, there isn’t, in this short expanse of
designated words, space to chronicle the entire magnitude of what transpired and how it
materialised, with any sort of justice to the principal characters involved in the wild and
trailblazing genesis that came to be AIME, or to any of the entropic neophytes and
proselytes, some of whom were quartered and billeted and some of whom took French
leave, but all of whom played a consequential part in the making. And there especially isn’t
nearly enough latitude in these few passages to articulate the sacrifices and zealous labours
of Jack Manning-Bancroft (JMB), my friend and brother, confidante, and fitful co-conspirator,
and the erudite perseverance with which he proselytised a political romance into a tangible
idea and movement that would inspire thousands of Australians of his generation, as well asthose who came before and after, in what will be regarded as one of the most significant
righting of inequalities in Australia’s history.
Conceivably, the most utilitarian and constructive use of this space is to sketch something a
little more abstract, so that one is able to garner an amorphous sense of some of the more
compelling and consequential ingredients that shaped the early thinking, and lend some
significance to the environment in which this grand scheme was hatched, nurtured, and
herded into the rampant bullring that it is today.
The notes scribbled below are, in part, made up of what I now know, and, for the larger part,
made up of journal-records deliriously complied and committed then; a bedouin treatise to
untangle the ramshackle remnants of what was an addiction to commit the many wild and
barbaric adventures to paper, and an unremarkable and degenerate attempt to stay sane.
INTRODUCTION
There are no beginnings, only moments where something is punctuated, and they are, as
much as anything, a resonance of everything else, a reverberation of the savage and
barbaric beating of the edifying drum that thrashes and beguiles us forward with resolute
hope. We are all confederates of this great affair.
DREAMING UP AN IDEA
The idea of “dreaming” necessitates something fantastical, an unreality conjured of seeming
impossibles that one hopes and hankers for, instigated by something imagined to be known
in the dark recesses of one’s reasoning. Musing over these contemplations is commonplace,
and, for most, often lost amidst the bewitching cadence of time, the chaos of moments, and
the effervescent animation of life.
For some the daydream metamorphosis into a mania, a mad pursuit of a grail, hopelessly
and righteously deluded by heretic beliefs to fashion what populations believe to be a
chimera: to defy the known to make the unknown real and commonplace. This is the
frenzied making of an act of revolution. It is the will of a few, those fantasists who could not
keep time with any honesty, to brawl unceremoniously to try protect and defend the lesser
against the greater and to strive for something “more” equal.
BEING A FOREIGNER
Being a foreigner in any place is a lonesome experience, namely because you are
fundamentally different and incompatible, in varying degrees, to the environment in which
you now exist. Despite our purported edification as a species and our peacocking of
civilisation, we are the scions and progeny of creatures with natural geographical dominions,
aggrandised kingdoms founded in animal tribalism to ground our belonging and apparatus of
survival. That being the case, there are only three choices available for the outsider:
(a) one either adapts and conforms; a thespian for the stage to frolic and perform for the
adulation of the crowd
(b) one remains as they are, where they are, and exists in whatever capacity they can, for as
long as they can
(c) or one leaves, never to return
If you wish to travel, see, and learn, if you’ve crossed the great Indian Ocean after having
been admitted to university, it serves no great purpose to abscond or scuttle the ship before
the caper and all its crusades had begun. The only real option available to a bearded
vagabond, or any wayfarer so far from home was to conjure some form of sangfroid balance,a ham-fisted circus harlequin act laced with a heavy dose of everything that I thought I knew,
and everything that I did know.
CONQUERED PEOPLES
The Indigenous populations have suffered the same fate as “the foreigners”, except that they
are crippled by a system that has rotund numbers and nursemaid mechanisms designed to
maintain the barbaric and oppressive status quo of now fallen empires, and the conquered
have fewer options available to them than the strangers who came to settle, and now both
have nowhere to go. The eminent functioning discrepancy for Indigenous Australians is that
their culture hasn’t changed to suit the new-world-order, so they continue to soldier through
the trenches with their modus vivendi. The philosophical reasoning as to whether people
should change and adapt, whatever the circumstances, or be allowed to protect what is
theirs in earth and flesh and belief, is far too great a topic to explode in this fugitive margin,
but, it’s an inescapable verity that savage wars, domestic and foreign, have been fought to
guard the same and less. At some point, there must be some redress.
LOOKING FOR A REVOLUTIONARY EXPERIENCE
The question a would-be rebel asks, is “why?” And when the answer is not satisfactory,
rightly or wrongly, he or she seeks to defy what exists in favour of their own convictions and
currency, and thereby mounts a resistance against the established peace.
We asked the question. We got the answer. We were not satisfied with the rejoinder. We had
our own ideas, and we decided to action them. We decided to rebel against the system.
There are two schools of thought that punctuated the early blueprint:
​ start a revolution centred around the disenfranchised populations
​ infiltrate the system and force change from within
Ultimately, both were utilised, but never with the militant creation that they were birthed from.
There were two crucial factors that influenced what would become the intellectual revolution
that AIME is today: the numbers and the population specifics. The quandary with the
numbers is that there weren’t enough, not nearly close to anything that would make a
difference to something that anyone would pay attention to. We tried. We failed. We tried
again. We failed again. And we kept trying and failing until we figured out that we couldn’t
get the numbers. What we did figure out was that the numbers were with the kids, so the
thinking had to change, the specifics needed to be different. There’d be no burning of flags,
no acts of civil disobedience, no gunpowder plot, no mayhem, and no chaos. The solution
was much simpler and far more sophisticated: education. Unlike Nelson Mandela’s violent
South Africa, AIME would borrow more heavily from India’s non-violent Mohandas
Karamchand Gandhi.
It should come as no great surprise when the established order disenfranchises and/or is
prejudiced against one people over another that the lesser will seek to defy the greater for a
more equal share, by one means or another, at some point in time.
JOURNALISM . . . & THE FOURTH-ESTATE . . . AND ART
Having no place amongst the clergy, the nobility, or the local populations makes the
Fourth-Estate a natural place to settle; a strange and decadent pursuit of the truth, more
romantic that it is and lesser practised than ancient voodoo, a purgatory for those with no
redemption and a haven for the delirious and delinquent.
This was where I met JMB, one eyebrow half shaved, the opposite side of his head carved
with a fantasy superhero lightning emblem, dressed like he’d recently escaped a hippiemad-house, and armed with a sharp mind and caustic tongue to defend his rampant
absurdity. To have judged him that day for his bizarre circus-act would have robbed me of a
great friend. The time it takes to know a person is no different to the way a thing is made,
there are many parts but the core is unmistakable in determining what a thing will do. That
same courage to be an outlier, to scream from his parish-pump soap-box fashioned like a
jester and preaching like a heretic-missionary, that resolve to stay the course has served
both him and the greater cause well.
Studying the trafficking and occupations of newspapers, reportage, and the media rendered
a few valuable lessons:
(1) There’s little to be gained from waxing-lyrical hypotheticals unless you have a kooky
fetish
(2) The real guts of the thing was to be a part of it and that meant getting out of school and
enrolling in life
(3) There were more important things to learn.
Art History & Theory was the place to be, a mad cartel led by the professor of professors, an
unstable and decadent genius with other agendas. It was the closest that there was to an
insurgency, led by an old guard with intimate knowledge and expertise, now made mildly
defunct with the inevitable autumn of time. Here we borrowed ideas, cast in colour on
canvas and etched in stone, an aesthetic history of dissenters, nonconformists, thinkers,
renegades, iconoclasts, apostates, unbelievers and idolaters, pagans, heathens and
separatists, from the divine moment to the present, all prisoners incarcerated in arresting
form.
CONCLUSION
These notes herein sketched bridged the irrational and tempestuous gaps of reason in the
long moments alone where I had the time and freedom to think and contemplate without
prejudice, as one does when one has no particular vested interest; there was no desperate
money on any horse and no gambling problem to solve.
What happened then was an immeasurable gauntlet, a parting of the seas where crooked
monies had otherwise been traded to keep the peace, because there was so little from which
to build change, and because nobody wanted it.
The ingredients for a dream are romantic manifestations who’s translation is a brutal
engagement against the way of things.

Jack message for day off
Hello everybody, I'm sitting in the Ethic Office in New York, Hudson Street, Financial District,
layers tap, tap, tapping away. I'm looking at five or six Mad Hatters and a bunch of other
things painted around here and copies of Hoodie Economics and youngsters are at the UN
doing their thing and Susan there and yeah, I've got a very, very, very clear direction for us
energetically now. I can feel what's coming down the mountain and the most important thing
I want us to do is to respectfully retreat. So if you're overextended in communication and
chasing projects, chasing people in different playgrounds, like if you're not close to thatchase being finished, if it's a new chase to start, then let's retreat. The frame that we've got
and the people that we've got. Already is more than enough and everything that we need. So
just take a step back and breathe. And so for the first week of April, I want to give you a
week to breathe again. So I'm going to give you all a nature week. So that'll be our second
nature week for the year. And I want you to breathe and I want you to realize a couple of
things in that nature week on the same of the week to be about boundaries and
understanding that we have to have boundaries to do this work. We have to draw
boundaries around what we're responsible for. And it's not for all of humankind. It's not for
everything. We can do our work in a very focused manner, but we can't be responsible for
everybody. And they are two different things. We can be responsible for ourselves and our
relationships to each other, but we are not responsible for what other people do. We can't
control people. I'm not in your minds. I don't want to be. And you don't want to be in my
mind. We have agency and autonomy in the world. And we're not in your minds. We're not in
your minds. We're not in your minds. We're not in your minds. We're not in your minds. We
choose to relate and how we relate. And that co-direction, that co-design is fused over long
periods of time and long periods of action and short periods of time and different
playgrounds. So this is the time, the moment to then go, we've been overextended. We've
been out pushing and pulling, trying to understand. You know it now. It's done. The
translation's done. And if you don't know, if you don't know everything, then I want you to.
Like as you're listening to this or listen back to it, save the audio. I want you to go out, find a
piece of dirt and draw a bunch of shapes on the ground that intersect with each other. And
remember that story we did in Australia. It's called Puzzle. We're all a piece of the puzzle.
You don't have to know everything. You don't have to know what I know. And this lady, Lynn,
said to us in San Francisco, she knew Buckminster Fuller when she saw him speak 50 years
ago. She said, I didn't understand a thing that he was saying. But I understood him. You do
not have to understand everything that I know. I do not have to understand everything you
know. But we can try our best to understand each other. And if we do that, then the funnels
for communication are open and we will move together. Invest in the relations. The actions
will take care of themselves. Trust everybody's skill set to apply what they need to do. You
now all have your playgrounds. You have your playgrounds to do the work. And let's just
make some cool tools now. Shepard people are coming to the platform and we can't control
everything. We can't control everything. We've done enough. You are enough. We built the
country. We did hoodie economics. I'm your employer and I'm saying you have done more
than enough to get to this point. And collectively, we have done more than enough to get to
this point. So now retreat and do it with technique. Do it within our skill set. And take a bit
more control back from us being like the ones that are desperately trying to please
everybody. And fit in everything. Return. Hold. And let's do this from strength. Let's do this
from our safe places. Let's do this from the places of the core of what we were born with,
with everything we've immersed ourselves in and learned over the last few years. The build
is done. Time to return and get our base in that foundation. And from that base and
foundation, smile. And nine years from now, our greatest challenge is that we're still smiling.AIME & Partners Letter of Support for Wellcome
Trust
To the Wellcome Trust Grant Committee,
Bujari gamaruwwa from the unceded Gadigal country in Australia, now known as Sydney!
As the Global Head of Impact at AIME, I am writing to express our strong support to the
Wellcome Trust Climate Impact Awards application being submitted by Professor Jeremy
Lauer, University of Strathclyde, on April 3rd 2024. With Indigenous Peoples embodying and
nurturing 80% of the world's cultural and biological diversity, and occupying 20% of the
world's land surface, this proposal bridging Indigenous knowledge systems and modern
science is a necessary advancement in our collective future to clearly show the climate
impacts from the frontlines, backed by necessary evidence, to shift the policies at the scale
and speed we need.
We also confirm our role as co-applicant on the grant team, and will have 2 other
collaborating Indigenous Systems Transformation organisations as part of our team - the
Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia; and the
Indigenous Commons, New York, USA.
AIME is an Indigenous-led non-governmental organisation, born out of Australia with
60,000+ years of imagination at its heart, working across disciplines and with a network
spanning 52 countries to solve the greatest challenges of our times and build a fairer world.
Created in 2005 as a global social change movement fueled by imagination and mentoring,
AIME has been alleviating inequity across mainstream systems using an Indigenous
knowledge systems lens. Having built the largest volunteer movement of University students
in Australia, working with 25,000+ Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander young people, we’ve
helped transform education from the inside out and have expanded our work internationally
since 2016. You can read more about the scaling journey through the Harvard Business
Case Study & Supplement on AIME, or look at the KPMG Economic Evaluation (2018) into
AIME that ascertained that for every $ put into AIME, $8.9 is returned to society, equating to
~$1.17 Billion worth of net direct economic impact.
Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs at Deakin University is AIME’s preferred research
partner, and a long-term collaborator. We conduct research projects across many disciplines
to inform innovative knowledge and solutions designed to return all human beings to their
ecological niche as a custodial species embedded in regenerative landscapes. In every
application of knowledge we seek to build in affordances that increase relationships with
humans, non-humans and entities of place, creating feedback loops that continue to
generate adaptive responses over time.
Indigenous Commons, rooted in 13 different Indigenous traditions, is building a participatory
governance model and alternate modes of value creation according to indigenous principles
and practices, in service to the most critical bioregions on earth. We convene a growing
movement of cultures from diverse traditions and geographies who braid ancestral wisdom,nature-based knowing and modern technologies to repair human systems. This network of
reciprocity and exchange is built on notions of value that emerge from the margins of our
economic systems, where living cultures still safeguard life.
As a co-applicant on the Wellcome Trust Climate Impact Awards Grant, I affirm the central
role our organisation will play. AIME, with its partner organisations, is committed to leading
the Indigenous systems perspective, including also the overall design, research, governance
from a translocal lens and application models, including at a local site in Australia. We have
collaborated with members of the grant team in the lead up to the application, including
attendance at a global grant writing workshop in March 2024. AIME will contribute at least
20% of their time to this project, and will be involved in the designing and implementing the
research. We can guarantee workspace for the duration of the award. We are also an
eligible organisation willing to sign up to Wellcome’s grant conditions. AIME is a global
not-for-profit with its headquarters in Sydney bringing together an unlikely group of humans,
more-than-human species, organisations & networks to build a fairer world for all.
Our AIME team who will work on the grant consists of Jack Manning Bancroft, Tyson
Yunkaporta, Parul Punjabi Jagdish, Joshua Waters, Arthur Little, Gabriela Romero, Suzanne
Bowles, Renilde Becque, Brenden Newton, Chels Marshall and John Davis. The work will be
supervised and coordinated by myself and the Research Consortium, namely, Jeremy Lauer,
Irmin Durand, and Geordan Shannon.
I can confirm that AIME will:
- Provide the the space and resources to deliver on agreed Wellcome Trust grant activities,
from the start date to the end date of the grant.
- Lead the consortium focused on the Indigenous systems knowledge lens and oversee the
design and delivery of several key aspects of the grant.
- Also lead the delivery of the local project in Sydney focused on repairing the human
disconnection from Nature using an Indigenous lens to create more sustainable long-term
food systems, whilst nurturing the oceans that surround us and the biodiversity therein.
- Provide all staff with the status and benefits of other staff of similar seniority.
I can also confirm that
- AIME's policy is that those employed through our organisation require salary recovery from
external grant funding; and
- AIME will underwrite the salary and post for the period of time that all staff will be working
on the grant
This grant, with such a diverse range of organisations working together, might actually help
reshape our current policies and systems in the direction we need, and hence we urge the
Wellcome Trust to give this the highest consideration.
Yours SincerelySystems Change Studio
Welcome to the Systems Change Studio. A home for systems change projects that have the
scope to solve the problem they are seeking to address at scale, and have the capacity to
release the knowledge into a tool that can be used for all of humanity for free, forever.
The model of the studio is to start with one outstanding organisation, idea, person and then
to fuse 5 unlikely connections to make a system wide nucleus stack for the work, the 12
month residency is formed as a campaign through the making of a hoodie podcast, we then
shape the 12 month accelerator action that will happen during the residency.
The making of a Hoodie Podcast is our ceremony in, it’s how we start with big story first,
leave space for emergence, fuse the hoodie economics into the project, and stack unlikely
connections to give it the best chance to channel the widest range of potential intelligence.
(Insert block case study on Sea The Weed.)
“The Sea The Weed Systems Change project was incubated via the Making of a Hoodie
Podcast, it led us to creating one of the world’s first ever seaweed hoodies and the first one
that is fully compostable, and then we found Operation Crayweed and committed to raise 1M
to help them reforest Sydney’s coastline including 15+ beaches. The Hoodie didn’t raise
enough $ on it’s own and because the tech hasn’t been scaled and it’s actually really
expensive when you cost all the real elements into making clothing we have been adapting
the $$ raise by creating a shareholders of the ocean experience for 20 Sydney based
organisations to contribute 5K a year for 10 years to spend time in the ocean and be in
relation with Indigenous systems thinkers and the underwater forest. We are hopeful that in
2024 we can complete the 1M raise, redirect the attention and time of organisations to the
intelligence of nature and in this case the underwater forests in our ocean and then graduate
the Sea The Weed ecosystem into a tool, which can then be picked up by ocean leaders
around the world.”

Partnering Letter
Hello,
I’m Jack, the founder of AIME, a relational systems change network to shift our systems to value
custodianship, mentoring, imagination in order to solve the challenges of our time and design a
healthier set of networks and systems for life on earth.I’m really excited to know you’re interested in partnering with us to shape a network of networks,
a digital country, and a lab for humanity to force multiply the systems change ideas into action,
and then into tools that can lead to mass scale.
My commitment in this note is I’ll only show one image, no colours, no big visualisations, no art,
just black words on white background. The depth of the story we have woven can come after
this. I want to be concrete in translating the complexity of our work and potential.
If you have received this letter, it’s because we are inviting you to be one of the first people in a
new nation, IMAGI-NATION, and to be one of the critical systems players inside the network of
networks. And/or because we are inviting you to be a partner, to walk this journey with us with
your knowledge, your mentorship, and your financial capital to allow us to activate
IMAGI-NATION as a relational economy at scale and then fuse the relations back into healthier
patterns on earth.
To start, we'll work through the challenge we have inherited, what we’ve learned at AIME over 20
years, and our proposed plan, and then isolate from the macro some of the key partnership
levers and opportunities for you and people you know to be engaged to power this new country.
There is no question this is the design decade of our time as a species. This is the moment
where we must find ways to fuse the best of our intelligence inside our systems, with our
intelligence way outside our inherited systems, the intelligence of the other 8.7 million species we
share this rock with, and almost every group of human beings that wasn’t centred in the colonial
movements, but systemically excluded from the development of modern systems, and at the
heart of this exclusion is our Indigenous people across the earth, of which I am so deeply deeply
lucky to be a part of. My family is Indigenous to Australia, and our people are the longest
continuously surviving people on earth, 60,000+ years. That’s a long human lab of intelligence
that we haven’t even scratched the surface of, let alone utilised the intelligence of. And right now,
we need all the labs we can get.
We also need to explore ways to foster genuine connections among ourselves. The influence of
historical empires and contemporary capitalism has driven a wedge between us, creating
divisions based on social class and cutthroat competition. With athletes elevated as our idols, we
pushed ourselves to the limit, striving for greater achievements, greater speed, and superior
intellect. Our focus was always on triumphing in life's challenges, vying to be the finest nation,
the finest city, the most exceptional street, the top student, the ultimate parent, the finest
individual. Yet, in this pursuit, we distanced ourselves from our foundational anchor – nature. We
fled from the very species that serve as a reminder of our responsibility as custodians of the
Earth. Instead, we engaged in relentless rivalry, swinging the pendulum of progress back and
forth, vacillating between being victors today and victims tomorrow, all while simmering
discontent brewed within us.
Enter the “social” networks pushing the voice for all. Everyone is a creator, and a journalist, and
everyone should always speak on everything; the more defined your views, the better, and then
you get followers. So we created billions of mini-god mindsets. Hero. Human. Individual.
Followers.
We have lost our way to relating to each other, we have lost our journalists, our space between,
and with these modern networks, we’ve given up our attention to become an economy,competing every day to take us deeper and deeper into our devices, distracted from some of the
most significant challenges we may have ever faced as a species boring down on us in parallel,
including climate change, social inequity, artificial intelligence, pandemic recovery and food
shortages.
All of these are interlinked, as all of us are. We are all in relation, to now, to before, to everything
that will come, we genetically share code and scientifically share atoms1, and we all have
approximately one atom inside us from every human being that has ever existed. We are much
more than the looks of our faces or our skin tonality.
We must think systemically in our design and then have the relational strength to hold a vast
systems map of as much of everything as our imagination can muster. Then we must apply deep
systemic action and solutions, many of which will simply be to reclaim, restore, revive, to recycle.
We have a planet with so much already. Our challenge is to move from extraction and
transaction to relations with each other and our fellow species of earth, now and into the future.
SCROLL DOWN IN THIS LINK TO SEE OUR VIDEO
With IMAGI-NATION we have a solution to help the world, not the solution. We understand our
role is to remind, nudge, and shape. We don’t want to be an empire. Still, we do know that there
is a path ahead when we focus on our relations first, not with who we know and what we know,
but with the knowledge and people beyond our margins; when we go to the unlikely spaces, we
generate relational strength, the fusing of two distinct elements have invented so much of our
chemistry magic on earth. To reignite the town square, we need a network powered by unlikely
connections and not in isolation. We need a weaving of cross-hatching that can provide a
luminescent flight map for relations to move beyond our streets, cities, and nations to a place
between us and them, between now and then, between why and what. We must design with the
best of the Internet to be able to create a contained economy for the exchange of value, to
emancipate the inequity of access to intelligence for those stuck inside inherited systems and the
inequity of access to the systemic design of our life on earth, to the design of our value systems
and economic movement, for those outside the margins.
We must focus on relating to each other and nature, anchoring each other in cross-pollinated
nuclei, and concentrate on systemic design patterning to centre relational economics as a lever
for advancement for all of us, with exchanges of time and knowledge, and opportunities. In this
playing field, we must find a way to translate from a contained economy back into Earth by
rewarding the reputational credit gained in a relational economy into transactions with $$ and
assets. We must design a network focused on the converging, unlikely minds to think, design,
and act. We don’t have the time to wait and hack the system with our pseudo-intelligence that
can critique. The critics must offer solutions or get moving with those with some. The solutions
must be systemic, hatched from a cross-section of thinkers inside and outside the margins. The
systems change projects must be able to scale across the earth by being built into tools in the
form of big stories and free accessible tools, and the custodians and thinkers that govern, design
and shape this network should be the custodians. The Indigenous systems thinkers of our earth,
the longest labs, and the governance circles should be filled with our mentors from all
backgrounds, the experts, the wise ones, and those who have walked the walk. Those with
imagination should also govern us, those who can harness a map and see the spaces between
you and me and what we see and what we’ll be.

Read Forbes Article, 2020We started a network back in 2005, and it’s called AIME. I founded the organisation at 19 years
of age and have led it since then, to where we are now, with a reach in over 52 countries. From
outside established systems, we have built unlikely connections with imagination and mentoring
between cultures and people inside and outside the margins for ~20 years. As the design decade
has beckoned the last few years, it’s seen us go as deep as we can to design an influential
network of networks built on the foundations of our years of work and thousands and thousands
of years of intelligence grounding us before then. Over AIME’s existence, we’ve worked one
relationship at a time, analog with real people, seeing the consequences of the world’s black and
white divisions, observing the economic struggle, the sadness inside oversized city executive
suites, the stuckness of many of our civilizations, the devastating lack of morality in the virus of
the modern social networks and attention economies eating the soul of the fourth estate. We’ve
watched the seas rising and seen that we must move for us-all, at scale, and we must find a way
to harness the best of us, with the best of the Internet, for movement. So we have been building
a nation for us-all, a digital country, for us to relate, design and apply systems change and to
create tools for that knowledge to be shared at scale. We have centred the values on universal
mentoring, imagination, and custodianship, and the economy is focused on units of exchange of
time, knowledge, and opportunities, which we are measuring in the form of energy between us
and nature. Our governance is in the circles of the wisdom of universal mentoring, imagination,
and custodianship. Our ultimate governance body is nature, which has led to us designing
IMAGI-NATION to have intentional death; under 10 years from now, it will die, and as a network,
we will intentionally give back to nature all of the IP to fuse songlines with modern economic
valuation of libraries, galleries, and museums.
This isn’t poetry or unanchored rhetoric.
We have raised over $150M in capital since 2005 and generated over $200M worth of in-kind
capital movement in the network. We’ve made the linear impact of progression through school for
marginalised youth and seen the flaws in isolated, contained predictive measurements that don’t
have relation or circularity to their movement. Now, we are taking on the challenge in our impact
measurement to fuse complexity and simplicity, the art and science, the numbers and story.
We’ve had the hero stories on our network, competed and won, and realised that our superpower
is to help harness the network of networks, to sit between the mystics and the mathematicians,
the outcasts and the operators, the engineers, and the elephants.
To bring into relation as a species, we need to refresh our default settings and re-orient our
relational context. We do that by mapping ourselves into relations with entities from the past,
non-human worlds, and the future. To bring citizens into IMAGI-NATION, we will do a deep
mapping process to these anchor points. From the deeper relational anchors of other species
now and before and tomorrow, we can then look at not what to do or what we want to achieve but
how to be, how to be a mentor, how to be a custodian, how to be in imagination, and with what
being we hope will transpire.
The flow of the network focuses on the cycle on the following page, from relations, to systems
change projects, to the development of tools. We activate the network through big story, and
through relations together in life. The network nucleus is focused on unlikely connections, which
is the essence of our ~20 years of work, and then mainly to organise people, we’ve fused the
framework of UNCx5 (Unlikely Connectionsx5), which we’ve tested with significant thinkers
around the world and applied in our network for the last five years deeply. Look at your hand, five
digits; that’s the core group of citizens in IMAGI-NATION, no one-off profiles, all together,hatched across nations, identities, ages, skills, and workflows. To increase relations, the network
moves like the incy wincy spider kid song intertwining our hands, and like Dunbar’s network2, out
to a core group of around 150 imagined natural, human, knowledge connections.
We already have the people to be in IMAGI-NATION to drive the core. There is no fancy
campaign needed. We’ve got a network of unlikely connections that can grow relationally and
through the application of systems change projects. I’ll share 2 components in this next section,
the first being how many people we need to start this NATION, and that number is 161, and it’s
not just people. The second piece is the early predictions of our impact reach across relations,
systems, and tools. Then I’ll share the partnerships we are looking to bring in as the core
mentors and thinkers, and network levers within IMAGI-NATION and conclude this letter and
invite you to a session with me to look under the hood at the elements.
The 161 entities are:
●
●
●
●
●
●
2
9 Cultural indicator species developed with Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs
(Already established)
22 Professors (Puppets) (Already established)
Governance Circles
● Imagination - 40 Organisations in partnership with Learning Planet (Already
established)
● Mentors - 25 Mentors in Residence
● Custodians- 25 (these are guides)
Systems Change Studio- There are 10 projects live that we will offer visas into the
Systems Change Lab
Toolshed - There are 5 tools we are developing for at-scale applications for humans
across the earth. Our partners working on the tools will have visas.
Core - 25 advanced groups - 5 from each of the fields working towards accreditation:
● Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs
● Organisations becoming JOY Corps
● Citizens becoming Systems Change Citizens
● Schools becoming Imagination Labs
● Marginalised youth becoming IMAGI-NATION Presidents and establishing
Custodial Economies.
Listen to the Other Others Podcast episode that I joined with Robin Dunbar & Tyson Yunkaporta.This core group of 5 is the nucleus of the relational economy, the five pillars of change; from this
core group of 25, we will tier the face-to-face invitations and will explain pathways to that below,
and we can offer scale (relatively infinitely) for people to apply to study at IMAGI-NATION
University to be accredited in the above pathways.
There are incentives for each tier group. The top 25 get invited on a world “Story” tour of cities,
the next 70 get a trip to Australia, the next 50 get access to a one-on-one mentoring session with
a high-quality mentor, and all, once accredited, get access to the jobs/opportunity portal. No one
can access it without having come into relation during this process, meaning organisations that
want to access one of the most robust talent pipelines of systems thinkers and designers from
outside the margins have to do the work to shift their system and behaviour to have access to the
network via the relations built.
This forms the inner spiral of our network, and from here, we can look to campaign larger
scalable plays via visas into IMAGI-NATION. The first 2 campaign visas to stimulate the global
economy of relations that we will release are:
1. Mentor Matchmaking Visa - For schools looking for mentors to deliver tutor squads (a
program frame/tool we’ve developed since 2005) & for citizens looking to lead a tutor
squad at their schools. For this, we will activate the base of our 25K plus people with
AIME Hoodies. This will happen in September.
2. Kind Visa - we will build on our work over the last two years on Very Important Kind
People (VIKP) and our work on Kindness over the last ten years to challenge festivals
around the world to be accredited as kind-fests and to offer VIKP tickets for people doing
the work.
How we will market IMAGI-NATION or go to the marketplace of life, is to work on the
accreditation of councils/cities/corporations/galleries/schools etc. in mentoring, custodianship,
and imagination, and we have a compelling suite of global thinking/delivery partners for each of
these
Internally at AIME, we have an exceptional core team of deep wisdom holders of about 30
around the world, and we will be moving in residencies for the first quarter to accredit a city and
then to accredit a JOY corp, and in the middle of the year we will travel in the big story as a
troupe to 5 cities (a bit like the Olympics of systems change) to light up a network, and at the end
of the year will see us in school residencies. We will release physical puzzles along the way and
pass on the pieces as a rolling campaign to invite people relationally to IMAGI-NATION to bring
the puzzle pieces back together by the end of the lifetime of IMAGI-NATION - break it down to
build it back up. We’ll be filming a documentary along the 10 years called Puzzle to try and
understand the node's value in the network and the energy between each other in relation.
We don’t want to grow our team beyond 50 full-time people. We want to have our core be about
50 people on staff, and then 50-60 leaders from organizations around the world we’ll support,
and I’ll work with to help them weave inside & outside the network. I’ve led AIME with 130
people, I feel comfortable that we can see the network core of 100-200 as our focus; and if we
nail this, we’ve done the thinking, and the technology is almost built (cost just over $1M and was
funded by Aus Government for Indigenous Australia to reach out and heal the world).We don’t want to have a fancy head office; we wanna be ninjas, dropping into places here and
there and lighting up the magic. We’ll have a storage facility with Hoodies, and have our
Professors (Puppets) and our virtual production studio to nail the tool development and impact.
Our central funds will be for our people, tool development, and then to bring people together
around the world in relation. We’ve scoped this out and believe that we can make this all happen
for $100M Aus over the next 10 years. We want to secure the $100M before October this year to
allow our network to be locked away from dollars and not able to be corrupted by the temptation
of further funding; our commitment once we hit the $100M is we won’t take another $, and with
the death strategy we know we only need a finite amount of financial resources.
This doesn’t mean we don’t want to see trillions of $ move in relation to nature and to powering
intelligence from outside the margins to design our systems of tomorrow - it just means we’ll
have what we need and then be directing you and the future partners to send your $ towards the
systems change projects coming out of IMAGI-NATION like the creation of 10,000 Indigenous
knowledge systems labs that we have started as a project with the Buckminster Fuller Institute in
USA, and the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs in Australia.
We have secured $12M of the $100M from the Aus Federal Government and are advanced in
several conversations with many of you worldwide. This is how we’d like to break down the
$100M and the partnership pathways we’d love your help with, either with you becoming one of
them or introducing us to someone who can drive this partnership nucleus core of
IMAGI-NATION with us. Here’s the partner wishlist:
1. Five of the first funders of a new nation - at $500K- $1M a year over a 5+ year period. 0
Secured right now.
2. 5 Governments - $4M each - $1M per year over four years - 1 secured.
3. 555 citizens as regular donors - a tiered model from $5 a week to $5555 - $1M per year
over 10 years. As of the writing of this letter, we have 12 secured.
4. Systems projects live for partnership include:
1. 1000 cities and councils accredited as IMAGI-NATION Embassies
2. 10,000 Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs
3. Imagination in every classroom
4. Nature Fund
5. Tool projects live
1. IMAGINE Film
2. Revolutionising Impact reporting
3. MentorApp - seeking partners.
4. MentorClass - seeking partners.
6. Imagination Art Fund - looking for 9 Gallery Directors - $1M target from Oct 2023- Jan
2024
We see the systems projects and tool development bringing in the remaining $30M over the next
10 years. And we are confident of securing the key partners around these playgrounds. For
example in the Systems Change projects, there are another 7 that are close to being finalised, all
with legitimate global systems players in partnership, and we welcome showcasing this with you
in a focused session. You’ll see in the next paragraph the macro pathways towards impact upon
which most of our partnerships are being fused.In terms of the projected impact, there are so many unknowns in the scale once we accredit an
organisation, for example, if an organisations with 20 offices becomes a JOY Corp and, in their
lever around mentoring mobilises 50,000 staff to mentor across 1000 schools, the impact is
going to reach 100,000 kids, and this is just one group. So let’s focus on the controllable
implications. We’ll look at who we will shift into relation as entities by the end of the ten years, the
number of systems change projects we will complete, and the tools we will make. From there, we
are really excited to share with you our R&D around how to visualise in real-time and, over time,
the richness of this data and its impact as it comes in. So now, to finish, let's paint a short picture
of impact projection.

Let’s get to work.
IMAGI-NATION - GRP (Gross Relational Potential)
$1 Trillion +
Welcome to IMAGI-NATION a digital nation that is focused on alleviating inequity for human kind and
all other species by turbocharging the 6000 people/entities we believe after 20 years of in the field
research can be the headwater to shift the health of life on earth.
The 6000 entities we have identified have a collective impact reach of at least 32 million people.
We focus on the entities that can impact 10000 people over the course of a lifetime (60 years), and
then we help them deepen the depth of their impact so the impact can increase to reach to 100K
people and deepen relations with nature.
AIME has founded IMAGI-NATION and one measurement of our early mentoring work valued our
return to Aus economy at $1.1 Billion, the JOY Corp model we have created as a pathway torelational health and wealth for organisations will see 1000 Joy Corps apply the first iteration of the
AIME Mentoring model as one of 70+ activations, including creating nature funds, a peace index,
kindness economics and other measurement systems which sit in the non financial at this current
time. The potential value of the mentoring component alone for JOY Corps could see $1 Trillion
returned to the global economy relationally. Without any further impact measurement.
We have valued that each of the 6000 entities impact could after their time in IMAGI-NATION see an
increase of 10K worth of value to each national economy. LOOK AT THOMAS Mathematics to 10
Quntillion USD. [ADD In a nutshell, this is using Metcalfe’s law, assumptions on the total network
built by IMAGI-NATION and assumption of the value creation per person in the network through the
network - assumptions that lead to 10QN: 32.000.000 people in the network across 10 years + 10K
USD value creation per person]
In terms of potential market value that lies ahead there is a minimum $750 billion nature based
marketplace that has yet to be unlocked, and the R&D value of the 6000 entities looking to unlock
custodial economies, centre the design depth and quality is worth at least $1 Billion of that share with
the 1000 Joy Corps, 1000 Indigenous Knowledge labs working on solving the nature economy
pathway as the labs consulting to leaders across the earth - it’s more likely that the potential market
share is some accusation of all the GDP around the world, that showcases the investment in the
move to well being measurements.
When we look at governments we may ask what is the R&D value of securing a parallel measurement
system to GDP that includes JOY, kindness, nature, peace, would it count in around 1% worth of all
GDP globally? Say total GDP is around 88 Billion, a further 1 Billion to well being score?
And then if we look to deep entrenched inequity, in areas outside the margins what can we learn from
death, from magic, from returning to relations with the water, from the power of the sun, what is the
total value of unlocking energy for all of human life?
In the toolshed what is the value of a knowledge text passed on? Of 100 texts that pass on deep long
knowledge? The IP of IMAGI-NATION and code all open sourced? What is the value of 1000s of
years of knowledge translated into IMAGINE Film? The value of the Professors bringing mentors into
every home? OF the mentor app providing a pathway for all citizens to be trained as mentors?
The network values the action, and we focus on the relation between each actor, we believe one
unlikely connection can change the world, that it creates imagination, and when harnessed with a
kinship system and growth across a UNCx5 we can see a force multiplier that moves at a depth of
relational quality that adds another dimension to the metcalf theory whereby we activate kinship
mapping models in the internet with UNCx5 growth fusion. We then map the health of the network the
focused actors to a limit of the number of faces we can know as per Dunbar research and then watch
the river run from there.
Then what may be the potential of all of this in IMAGI-NATION, of our collective imagination, what
price may we put on this? Maybe time will tell, maybe we will never be able to measure it.
With value of GRP (Gross Relational Potential) of over trillions of $, we believe after 20 years of
evidence based research that we are well placed to help humanity unlock it’s potential and economic
prosperity in relation to nature not abstracted from it.

AIME LAUNCHES IMAGI-NATION
On 21st October 2023, at 3:15 PM AEDT, amidst the complexities unfolding from the
referendum in Australia, the wars waging around the world, the global climate crisis, & all
else, the sacred Bunya Mountains hosted AIME (Australian Indigenous Mentoring
Experience) - watch this short welcome video if you’re new to our worlds - for a unique
ceremony to launch AIME’s digital ‘network of networks’, IMAGI-NATION, to bring hope & joy
back into our lives through the transformational power of storytelling, wherever we reside.
Realising that humans are fundamentally good but the networks we have inherited are
divisive and put us into echo chambers, we left social media in 2019, and started building
our relational network, IMAGI-NATION, with 50+ key global organisations & networks as
co-custodians, that centers Indigenous knowledges and intelligence from outside the
margins into the mainstream systems design and activates humanity as a whole to healthier
patterns synched with natural economies.
AIME’s digital ‘network of networks’ IMAGI-NATION
The big prize is returning humanity to our custodial relationship with each other and Nature by centering
imagination as the critical skill to get us there, and by using mentoring as the methodology to allow this
knowledge to be transferred freely across generations. We will:
- Model a relational network, connecting us to people and ideas we’ll never likely encounter and change the
way the world works by providing a scalable alternative to the current sick social networks of today without
their self-serving algorithms.-Unearth for humanity the most enduring source of human knowledge on the planet - Indigenous systems
thinking, fusing it with the best of modern knowledge systems to support the world’s largest lab of
co-design within complex systems.
- Create an ecosystem of activated 1M+ stakeholders; completing 100+ systems change projects to
showcase scalable impact and shifting current unhealthy systems at play in education, employment,
finance, fashion, sustainability etc.; and leaving behind 50+ valuable tools, designed to continue to shape
the design of our living systems well into the future.
For a deep dive into IMAGI-NATION, watch this 25-minute immersive tour video of the platform.
In the two weeks leading up to the launch, the AIME team (from more than 15 countries),
and some of our key partners from around the world, joined us as we travelled together
across Australia - spending time in Nature, with Elders, with Indigenous youngsters, with
schools, community centres and organisations to relationally launch IMAGI-NATION.
As part of the journey, the AIME troupe created a magical universe everywhere we stopped
in our bus ride to Bunya, inspired by the Freedom Riders of yore - Sydney, Brisbane, Coffs
Harbour & Byron Bay. Through an immersive theatre experience called “PUZZLE” that
brought to life office spaces, galleries, Indigenous corporations, schools etc., starting from
the sidewalk and into the main space, using ceremony, sound, music, puppets, magic,
movement, art, and sound - featuring the Yidaki and clapsticks from our Country, poems
from the continent of Africa, singing bowls from India, as well as harps, drums, guitars and
more - the AIME team curated an experience inspired by indigenous cultures like no other
with their global team from around the world.
This moment marked three key milestones in AIME’s phenomenal journey as an Indigenous
Corporation that has gone global to shift the world at large -
1) The launch of IMAGI-NATION.
2) The launch of Hoodie Economics, AIME Founder & CEO Jack Manning Bancroft’s
latest book on redefining what we value and how we might rebuild our systems to
make them whole again using Indigenous Systems Thinking.
3) The launch of AIME’s IMAGI-NATION Galleries campaign, which will bring 1,000
galleries together over the next decade to focus on imagination and use art as a
medium to transform society for the better of us all. Some of Australia’s best artists
have donated their artworks to also help raise funds for AIME’s critical work over the
next decade.
Yours in imagination,
Jack Manning Bancroft, AIME Founder & CEO
MORE ABOUT AIME●Born out of Indigenous Australia, with 60,000+ years of imagination at its heart, AIME is a
not-for-profit that serves as an imagination lab to solve the greatest challenges of our times.
Created in 2005 as a global social change movement fueled by imagination and mentoring,
AIME has been alleviating inequity and now operates in 52 countries. The heartbeat of
AIME still remains firmly planted in Australia with 25,000+ Aboriginal & Torres Strait
Islander youth rising up as leaders through their work, alongside 10,000+ University
students as Mentors to walk alongside them.
●There is 6+ years of independent University-led research that documents the impact across
the entire ecosystem. You can read more about the scaling journey through the Harvard
Business Case Study & Supplement on AIME.
●AIME’s Economic impact is far-reaching as it redefines what economics means, and the
journey is properly captured in the above mentioned book, Hoodie Economics. For
traditional economic frameworks, there is also a KPMG Economic Evaluation (2018) into
AIME that ascertained that for every $ put into AIME, $8.9 is returned to society, equating
to ~$1.17 Billion worth of net direct economic impact.
●To model a healthy regenerative sustainable system, AIME has an intentional death date set
for March 2033, after which we cease operations & return our IP back to Nature and the
ecosystem around them.
●AIME’s work specifically in centering the intelligence of youth from outside the margins
has gained acclaim worldwide with AIME being recognised on Global Stages as one of the
Top 50 Organisations in Education, UNESCO's Global Education Coalition, Fast
Company's World Changing Ideas in Education, Top 100 Leaders in Education, and so on.

AIME’s IMAGI-NATION $100m Funder Invitation
October 2022
The Invitation / Summary
Welcome to the IMAGI-NATION $100m funder invitation.
This document maps AIME’s 18+ years of track record creating life-changing impact by bridging
marginalised youth & communities in 52+ countries with those inside the margins to create an
offline relational network, validated by independent research from Harvard, KPMG & several
leading Universities, and the plan to turbo-charge systems change at scale by digitising this with
the creation of a virtual nation, IMAGI-NATION. This online and offline space will be for all
people from all races and spaces, from inside and outside the margins, to gather and rewire the
relational patterns on planet earth, as we have done since 2005. Together we will re-discover
our custodial nature and build a global lab for humanity that over the next 10 years will power
the most significant relational exchanges with knowledge and each other, generated by unlikely
connections as the catalysing spark. Relationships beyond our echo-chambers and interest
groups represent the key to solving the challenges of our times. Welcome to IMAGI-NATION.IMAGI-NATION will:
1. Change the way the world is networked, to provide a scalable alternative to the current
social networks without the self-serving algorithms of division and diversion - this will
be a relational network, connecting humans to ideas & people we are not likely to
encounter otherwise in order to build cohesion & empathy.
2. Unearth for humanity the most enduring source of human knowledge on the planet -
Indigenous systems thinking, which will inform the design process from the ground
up. We are bringing together intelligence from outside the margins with those inside the
margins to support the world’s largest lab of co-design within complex systems.
3. Harness our algorithm of unlikely connections, which we have synthesised from First
Nations Lore and practice, along with decades of scientific research into optimal
team-building and inter-group dynamics to harness the power of our collective
imagination to solve the challenges facing our planet.
This is an invitation to make a one-time contribution toward our US$100M goal which we
aim to raise in the next 12 months. This fund will support the entire network for 10 years,
at which point we will close AIME and transfer our assets and work to the network we
have built.
10 years after the launch of the network, i.e. in 2033, IMAGI-NATION and AIME will initiate its
own formal ending to create a systemic regeneration as part of an intentional design strategy
informed by natural life-death cycles. We believe all organisations should have the same
limitations of mortality as all other entities in creation. This is in order to optimise their impact
in the world, within the natural limits of scale, and not build empires that inevitably create
otherness and consolidation of power & resources for a few.
As we set our sights towards the next 10 years we have some significant objectives that will be
achieved via this network. Amongst systemic shifts that will redefine the power of relational
networks (as compared to social networks), showcase relational economies, and a return on
relations. We have some specific impact metrics at play for those entering and working in
IMAGI-NATION, which include:
●
●
●
building the capacity of 1 billion human beings to be trained as mentors to help
humanity return to its custodial role with other species in Nature, and learn to pass on
knowledge, network & opportunities with each other freely for the benefit of all;
to create system change projects, especially to reimagine and reinvent the current
unhealthy systems at play in education, employment, finance, fashion and sustainability,
as a few examples;
to leave behind an array of valuable tools, designed to continue to shape the design of
our living systems well into the future, that can be picked up by others to build strong
systemic movements of change to address future challenges.
We invite you to be a part of a relational network that will transition our systems at large. The
timing is important as we live during times of rapid change when institutions need to be agile
and responsive.
In terms of an economics frame, this network is powered by Hoodie Economics, an
interdependent system of exchange that we have championed since 2005 (with a book currently
under-publishing capturing the depth and complexity of the model). We are now looking to
digitise and scale this through IMAGI-NATION. As a quick summary, Hoodie Economics focuses
on a relational economy in which we exchange time, knowledge and opportunities, where the
formula is not give-take, but give-give in the fashion of Indigenous traditional economies. We
share without expecting anything in return, and we know it’s not a waste of time becauseabundance always emerges within cyclical interconnected systems.
Hoodie Economics draws on Indigenous thinking systems and alternative intelligence sources,
to look at the systems of money, ownership and reductive thinking that we have inherited, and
how we have the potential for a new (old) foundation that embraces balance and equity – a
relational economy instead of a transactional one.
In increasingly anxious and tumultuous times, this network offers transformative solutions to
place-based connection, knowledge-sharing, custodianship and joy at the centre of our world.

Introduction
AIME is an 18 year old tried-and-tested networking model that focuses on unlikely connections
to build regenerative networks. These networks cast off the shackles of a couple of hundred
years of exclusive, elite, empire building models that served few, and devalued most.
For the next 10 years, AIME is building a digital country, IMAGI-NATION, to accelerate the
relational exchanges between those inside and outside the margins that help build a fairer world
for all. We are basing our design process around Indigenous systems thinking - intelligence from
outside the margins that is included in the creation of the oldest human labs of knowledge on
earth. MIT media labs is 37 years old, Indigenous Australian intelligence is 60,000+ years old,
and then let’s find a system from nature, say mycelium, which is over 700 million years old, the
question again becomes, where are we placing our value on sources of intelligence? Where are
our labs to shape the design of life on earth? This is why we’re building IMAGI-NATION.
The Economy is Hoodie Economics and is a relational economy based on exchanges of time,
knowledge and opportunities.
No $$ is exchanged in the network. No advertising. No data stolen.The network is built on an algorithm of unlikely connections x 5, which has been shared via
consultation with some of the world’s leading thinkers in the field of human social systems,
including Tyson Yunkaporta, Robin Dunbar and Fritjof Capra.
Our goal is regenerative knowledge production, reclaiming for humans our true role and
ecological niche as a custodial species.
The network lives for 10 years and then it dies - as all living things will - with radical
transformation of human systems over the next decade. We have 10 years of accelerated
imagination to solve the messy problems of our time, including the core challenge of modelling a
different way for us to be networked; not by transaction, but by relation.
Our three playgrounds of impact
1) Capacity Building for 1 Billion+ people - via unlikely connections, mentor training,
and action within the network. Including:
a) Via IMAGI-NATION{University}, AIME’s online university and systemic training
tool, we’ll train 1000+ Global Ambassadors in organising change - to alleviate
educational inequity for at least 100,000 young people from outside the margins
b) 1 Billion+ people trained as Mentors via Go1’s ecosystem and via AIME’s
IMAGI-NATION{University} accelerator program, and the Mentor Training tool at
large - to create a global citizen population of mentors, that work in relation with
each other
c) 50,000 jobs, scholarships and mentoring opportunities unlocked for young
people outside the margins via the Connections space
d) Dreamspace TV, a spin-off of IMAGI-NATION{TV}, helping the dreams come true
for 400+ schools around the world that serve young people from outside the
margins
e) Making of a Hoodie Podcast - helping rewrite the uniform set of rules for 200+
schools to unlock the potential for young people from outside the margins to
shape a story and create their own custom uniform in the form of a Hoodie that
binds a school, a town, a province and a nation.
2) Systems Change - via unlikely connections we work on systems changing projects.
Including:
a) Nature Fund: working with ethic and Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs to
design a Nature investment vehicle to centre nature in our financial systems and
generate industry equivalent or greater returns whilst increasing biodiversity
b) The Imagination Project: working with the Learning Planet Institute to bring
together a coalition of organisations (examples include educational
organisations across Australia, Canada, Ireland, UK, Poland, Netherland, Pakistan,
France, Morocco, Russia, Bangladesh, India, and more) to work on a 10 year
project to centre imagination in the schooling and educational experiencec) Imagination Curriculum: a focused 3-year research project in collaboration
with the Australian Government & 3 premier Australian Universities, funded by
the Australian Research Council, to transpose AIME’s imagination curriculum
into the entire Australian schooling system & be available for schools around the
world
d) The ReclAIMEd Project: working on solving the challenges of dead stock and
creating a global circular fashion economy, featuring partnerships with Thread
Together, and Fashion brands around the world.
e) The JOY Project: bringing the JOY Corps accreditation to 5000+ corporate &
community organisations (first group of partners include Salesforce, PwC, Q5
Consulting, Gucci etc.) to build their own accelerator Co-CEO programs for
marginalised young people to bring the intelligence from outside the margins
into the boardroom. At the same time, these organisations will activate their staff
to build mentoring bridges with local high schools to bring the diversity pipeline
into organisations, and get leaders out to learn from different sources of
intelligence. This is on top of building their own kindness economies and JOY
targets for the organisation.
f) Kindness Currency - building an alternative economic model that values
kindness as the main driver of value. In partnership with music festivals around
the planet, we will showcase the economic power and strength of kindness as a
stimulus for our networks, systems, and economies. The current campaign
HUMAN/KIND/\\/KIND\HUMAN is a 5 year campaign with the goal of taking
the knowledge and evidence to Davos and other world leaders to see systemic
implementation of kindness economies in government, business, school and
within civic society.
g) Intentional Death Strategy - working with governance bodies globally to leave a
new framework of governance. AIME has recently approved a 10 year intentional
death strategy from the onset of IMAGI-NATION. AIME will intentionally close its
doors and will plan to transition its assets and IP to Nature, and embed our
values & methodologies into other organizations poised to continue the work
regeneratively. Through this we will more deeply embed our work into multiple
sectors and systems and allow that work to grow more rapidly and organically.
We are thus modelling regenerative organisational relational design where we
don’t build singular empires, but healthier ecosystems which value relationships,
sharing of knowledge freely and then passing on the notes for posterity.
3) Tools - creating a wide range of valuable tools for the human race. When
IMAGI-NATION comes to a close in 2033 we will leave behind a library of tools
packaged in rich stories and resources for humankind to keep working with, all
long-term ongoing projects, including:
a) The 30+ year case study story of the AIME network and IMAGI-NATION and
leaving behind the code and the Relational Network Map
b) MentorClass for teachers - a comprehensive suite of lessons for teachers around
the world to transition into the role of mentors and utilise imagination to unlock
the potential of young people from outside the margins
c) The Professors series for parents and their teenagers to watch at home - a
modern muppets, a Mentor TV show, following the quest of 6 Professorsfounding a university - IMAGI-NATION{University} to solve the challenges of our
time
d) Mentor Training tool for humanity - featuring 18 values to work through, this
off the shelf tool provides NGOs, governments, schools and parents with a toolkit
to unlock our mentoring potential and be in relation with each other.
e) IMAGINE film - a co-created film written by young people from outside the
margins, CEOs, Prime Ministers, artists & more, as a text that centres Indigenous
knowledge and lands a popular culture story for our screens to think about how
we think, who we are, and the world we want to design in the future.
f) Books including 101 Lessons in Organising Change, Professor Hope’s
IMAGI-NATION Cookbook, Flipping the Script Article in the Mighty Tome, Hoodie
Economics, The Mentor & more.
g) Dreams Documentary looking at where Dreams come from from the
perspective of young people around the world.
h) 100,000+ Hoodies distributed over 30 years, connecting humans by a common
thread, and forming the spine of a relational economy.
IMAGI-NATION is real and lives in between Earth, Web 2 and Web 3 - it’s powered by AIME staff
around the world, along with a suite of alliance partners activating networks in real-time.
We also have a physical IMAGI-NATION{Factory} in Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter, and soon
several travelling IMAGI-NATION{Embassies} driving around the world. These {Embassies} will
connect kids from outside the margins with the network and those from inside the margins with
missing intelligence.

leadership team includes intelligence from outside the margins, with experienced
practitioners globally; we have four female C0-CEOs, all from diverse backgrounds of
intelligence, Jacqueline Twillie from the USA, Sarue Kamudyariwa from Zimbabwe,
Sarineh Garapetian from Armenia and Suzie Winkelman from Australia.
IMAGI-NATION {University}’s Vice Chancellor, Steph Beck, is the first Indigenous Vice
Chancellor in Australian history.
US foundation CEO, Parul Punjabi Jagdish, is originally from India, having spent a cross
section of work in film, community development and consulting practices globally,
having led change initiatives across Asia, Europe, Australia & North America.
CFO, Simone Twiss, and Head of Legal, Justin Moses, have both held significant roles in
global entities. Our strategy support includes former CEOs of mental health
organisations and global journalists who work on war correspondence across the
continent of Africa.
Head of impact, Irmin Durand, is from Kenya, and lives between Europe & Africa, and has
a lifetime of work in stories and understanding humanity.
Communications lead, Ben Knight, has led campaigns and communications for one of
Australia’s top non profits.
Head of Puppetry, Vanessa Ellis has spent 30 years in professional puppetry. Our
production and animation team have worked across major platforms and production
companies.
Head of HR, Kristy Greaves, is one of the only Indigenous people across Australia leading
HR teams globally.
Lead for our global mentors, Rhian Miller, is a former mentee in the program from
Australia.
We also employ professional actors and former athletes who have played on the biggest stages
and we have a strong team of personnel spread across the continent of Africa, the USA and
Australia. We are confident in our fusion of unlikely connections across our distributed
leadership team.AIME is led by our Founder and CEO, Jack Manning Bancroft, who has supported these roles at
AIME for 18 years. Jack is a member of the Bundjalung nation & founded AIME in Australia in
2005 as a 19 year old at Sydney University.
AIME was founded to address the network inequity we had inherited and knew that if we
wanted to change the world we had to network differently, build more highways of exchange and
shift where and how we value wealth, knowledge and intelligence, by linking people from inside
and outside the margins into a network of unlikely connections powered by bridges of
mentoring. After close to 20 years leading this network to now reach 52 countries AIME is
confident in the wisdom Jack has acquired to help us navigate this space. Jack is deeply inspired
by his Aboriginality and relation to Indigenous systems intelligence and thinking, and has spent
his lifetime building unlikely connections across sectors & geographies. He is a graduate of The
University of Sydney and Stanford University, a published children's book author and a former
NSW Young Australian of the Year.
Jack has also received a Human Rights Medal, an Honorary Fellowship from the University of
Western Sydney and is the youngest person in Australian history to be awarded an Honorary
Doctorate, which he received from the University of South Australia. He is currently an Honorary
Fellow at Deakin University with the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab.
Jack has authored Hoodie Economics which will be released globally in September 2023.
The problem
Capitalism in its current form and colonial empires in recent times have exacerbated inequality
and division globally. Wealth and power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small
number of people. At the same time, those living outside these structures or on the margins,
hold unique and in many ways, untapped knowledge, skills, and currencies. Increasing division
is destroying the climate, our communal bonds, and our ability to solve our core problems
More specifically, the challenge right now is that we are still inheriting world orders and systems
in the forms of schools, workplaces, housing, natural resource management etc. all managed
through the pipeline of a generational design based on a very small lens determining what was
valuable. This has led to big palaces and large swathes of exclusion. Progress has come in the
shape of a few drawbridges and the kings and queens of empires ‘inviting’ those they had led
through spiritual, mental, structural, and physical genocides, into the tea room to say, “now you
may be included as citizens in our world”. In doing so we’ve invited those outside the margins,
those that were excluded, into the current system to play with the same rules. The biggest
travesty here is asking those outside the margins to come into the house but drop their super
powers - their intelligence, their systems thinking, their models of wealth and value, their
patterns, their shapes and their designs.
We are missing the window for human transformation at a critical time when the earth needs
new intelligence. The trick is, the intelligence is in the rearview mirror, in the stars, in the
ground, in the animals, in the land, and in each other. It’s stored, locked away, waiting for us to
find it.Currently, the intergenerational clubs, the private schools and secret societies keep the power in
the limited nature of the network. That’s really clever if the goal is to keep the share of the pie in
the hands of the few, but it isn’t so clever when suddenly you need more than the $$ in your
bank account.
The Solution
Our solution is an alternative to the networks that distract and mine our data to manipulate us.
We must re-pattern our inherited networks. To help solve the increasingly complex challenges,
and to help redesign our broken systems, the solution we propose is a relational network,
IMAGI-NATION, powered by unlikely connections. IMAGI-NATION builds a network of
knowledge and mentorship, which is wired to bring in the intelligence from outside the margins
into the centre of the design frame so we can access the largest source of untapped intelligence
in the human thought experiment, the intelligence from outside the margins (more on this in the
next section). Tapping into the longest continuous human civilisations and natural systems, we
are creating a knowledge systems lab for development and design of systems, economic frames,
impact measurement and societal design to solve the challenges of our time and posterity. This
network also includes a new currency valuing relations and centering exchanges of time,
knowledge and opportunities (as against $$).
As a recent specific example that highlights the need for different types of networking and
knowledge sharing, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped planes, and halted human contact as we
knew it. This disruption created a space for existing intelligence and other forms of medicine to
move from nature and places outside the margins to other places within the network. These
then create connections and unlikely connections to meet and solve challenges in our health. A
study published in Nature magazine on August 1 2022 titled “Social capital II: determinants of
economic connectedness” looked at over 72 million people and their friendship connections and
the correlation with inequity. And one of the key conclusions was that unlikely connections -
shifting the network from affirming likely connections amongst social groups, race groups and
economic status - can allow a level of bridge building and unlikely connections that can create
more equality and movement out of poverty. Ray Chetty, Harvard Economist and co-author of
the paper said, in summarising the findings, that “Growing up in a community connected across
class lines improves kids’ outcomes and gives them a better shot at rising out of poverty.”
Intelligence from Outside the Margins
People think the way to fix the problem of poor people is to ‘help the poor people’.
That’s not the way.
They don’t need help, they need a role, and when nature is the role, it turns out most of the
people who are poor in this capital system have long DNA of healthy relations to nature. If we
centre nature, we centre intelligence from outside the margins and we won’t spend so much
time on how we set the table for people of different colour and who sits where, we are out by the
fire, near the tree, with the lake, giving back to pass on the notes. We are in flow, we are in
relation, our energy spurts have purpose, and the purpose is natural. Our role as custodians,movers of energy, knowledge and action, to nature, with nature, for nature. And then we pass on
the notes and nature teaches our children and their children and on and on it goes.
When we centre nature we remember that we are all custodial species, we are human. Beyond
Indigenous and non-Indigenous, black-white, human and nonhuman, what we have forgotten is
our natural relation to nature. Whilst we protest and scream about climate change, because the
platforms reward the noise, we forget that we can go for a swim, a walk, look at the stars, all free,
all now, all for us to share.
In oppositional relations, one human group is silent, and one is loud but immature, so to counter
that, we all whisper. We are all valuable, in our worth we can share our intelligence, and if our
collective pursuit for health is with nature, we release ourselves from our opposition with each
other. Imagination frees us, and nature anchors us. Imagination gives us the freedom to think, to
play, to move, to see the map, to travel, and nature guides us, it keeps score, it’s our ultimate
anchor point for complexity and impact.
Theory of Change - UNCx5
Our network algorithm is based on Unlikely Connection x5 - connecting people in unlikely
relations with 5 entities, human or non human, to create a different regenerative cell of
connections.
Why the number 5 you ask?
In the first 12 years of AIME’s work, we had unlikely connections x 2, between an Indigenous
high school student in Australia and a university Mentor. The focus of the narrative and relation
was enhancing the differences, remarking at the ways of life, of being, of what we looked like
that were different and unique in our different places and spaces.
What would happen in Unlikely Connections x 2, is even after common ground was established,
worked through shared equity in the map, even once joy was unlocked and intangible value in
the space of imagining and wandering; both parties would leave the table and return to their
camp. Within an hour, a day, a week, they’d have already lost their connection to the person on
the other side of the table and reverted to the established patterns of being, the values of the
local, repeating what had come and focusing on the individual lens. Until they meet again, and
try gaining some perspective and knowledge, and yet, that was not durable.
As we explored the relational patterns, we found that once we reached Unlikely Connections x 5
(UNCx5), i.e. a group of 5 people that come from very different backgrounds (across race,
gender, geography, socio-economic status etc.), there started to be a stickiness to the shape.
There was a circular energy that would unfold with five, there was a sense that if someone
dropped out, the other four would find a way to keep generating the energy and connections.
The most important realisation for Unlikely Connections x 5 came when we discovered that
when each new connection is unlikely, the network unravels, the patterns of specialisation, race,
culture and nations, and our fixed mindsets evaporate and the space left in between is humankind. It becomes so complex that we find deep commonalities, like our imagination as a species,
our ability to laugh, our relationships with nature and our feelings of love.
It turns out, there is a lot of research that stacks up around the number 5 being the ideal team
size or the ideal amount of friends you can have at any one time. Below is a graph created by
British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who has spent decades looking at numbers in relation to
our friendships and social groups. It’s a number chart that shapes the patterns of friendships
and relations from inside to out and factors upwards in patterns of 5. With the key group being
close friends which Dunbar sees as the number 5. Explaining the theorem in an interview with
the Atlantic magazine in 2021 Dunbar says “The distribution of the data formed a series of
layers, with each outer layer including everybody in the inner layer. Each layer is
(approximately) three times the size of the layer directly preceding it: 5; 15; 50; 150; 500; 1,500;
5,000. The innermost layer of 1.5 is [the most intimate]; clearly that has to do with your
romantic relationships. The next layer of five is your shoulders-to-cry-on friendships. They are
the ones who will drop everything to support us when our world falls apart. The 15 layer
includes the previous five, and your core social partners. They are our main social companions,
so they provide the context for having fun times. They also provide the main circle for exchange
of child care. We trust them enough to leave our children with them. The next layer up, at 50, is
your big-weekend-barbecue people. And the 150 layer is your weddings and funerals group who
would come to your once-in-a-lifetime event.”
From research in the army around team sizes of 5, to Jeff Bezos saying the ideal team size was
the amount of people that could share a pizza as a meal - roughly 5. There was definitely a
pattern of research stacking up alongside what we’d seen practically.
The difference being, in our work, we were adding a design element by identifying the 5 and
investigating how we created a generative capacity to the relations. We ensured that once we
had one person in the group, we would make the biggest possible unlikely connections leap to
the next person, and continue this until we found our 5.Thus we had an algorithm on our hands resulting in our network design. And what’s nice is that
it is shaped the same as the number of digits on our hands. Five. To re-pattern the network, we
had to find our unlikely 5, and then as in Dunbar’s map, we had to multiply the pattern in sets of
5.
We looked down at our hands and saw the 5 digits and thought, yeah that’s about right, unlikely
connections x 5 (UNCx5), and then when you incy-wincy-spider it, we’ve got ourselves a
regenerative network in flow. Moving knowledge inside and outside the margins in relation, and
that would see those outside the margins have many avenues to move, not simply defined to just
their own postcode or nation state. UNCx5’s keep multiplying and moving endlessly, bringing in
more unlikely connections. A design formula for networking that can design against hegemony,
institutionalisation, decay, and inequity of knowledge and relations.
We are only a year or two into formalising the UNCx5 model across our network and are now in
the process of building more research around it to see if it may be the ideal team size for
organisations. We think it’s a model for organisations to build their project teams and to look
around the room to say, okay is this group unlikely enough? Have we gone UNCx5 on it? The
result is work that activates imaginative thinking, and illuminates where an organisation is
homogenous and needs regeneration.
The challenges and risks
The main challenge for a digital network we see is the audience engagement. That’s why we’ve
spent 18 years building a physical network and system that we’ve already started digitising and
that now reaches across 52 countries. With key staff located across Africa, Australia, Europe and
the USA, we feel we are well situated to activate the network.
The next challenge is people’s attention fighting against the current distraction economy, and
specifically how to get to young people’s attention. We side-step this by going to schools directly,
and with our IMAGI-NATION{Embassies} on wheels we’ll take IMAGI-NATION to the school
doorstep. When we have {Embassies} on each continent we can drive between major cities and
the most isolated schools and connect humanity together. All {Embassies} will be connected
globally in a distributed leadership model to ensure intelligence is collectively owned and
shared.
The AIME team will be the outreach team and the main focus of the investment of $US100M over
the 10 years. They will be the ones activating the relations with young people outside the
margins and those inside the margins.
A challenge lies in packaging knowledge in an imaginative way, so it has cut-through and the
tools last. That is why we invest in artists and storytellers to bring the show to life, to create
tools like MentorClass or The Professors. It’s why we work on fashion and music and immersive
theatre, because when we are in imaginative states, we are in movement. And it is true that
artists lead the revolution!
Another challenge is having a heartbeat to the movement. We have just taken over a Cinema
Complex in the heart of Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter next door to Fox Studios. This is ourglobal headquarters which we have turned into an IMAGI-NATION{Factory}. This will be another
area of investment for us to bring kids, and people from around the world together to the
Factory over the next 10 years.
Another risk challenge is unintentionally building another distraction tool that sucks humans
away from each other. With network platforms, the desire to ‘gamify’ and create addictive
behaviour has become so normalised that we’ve almost lost grip on reality. Tools and
experiences shouldn’t mine our lives, they shouldn’t own us, or our information, but rather, they
should enhance. Great art is made to inspire us, and after we see the film, artwork or piece of
theatre, we leave, never to see it again. The painting doesn’t follow us down the street and track
what we ate next, how we slept or what dreams we had. We have mitigated this trap by creating
a very clear reminder at the door that IMAGI-NATION is at its core simply a reminder. It’s a
nudge to reclaim space and time, that as a species we are naturally custodial and nature gives us
all the imaginative fuel we need. Upon entry to IMAGI-NATION, the network will open with a
simple pledge system to help people reclaim their imagination minutes by asking ‘are you sure
you want to come in? You’ve already got an imagination, maybe you just need some time back?
Some time in nature?” and we encourage people to pledge imagination minutes, turn off their
devices and go into nature. Part of the tactic of this network-build is to have the moment to grab
the attention of the audience so we can remind them that they are already enough and the world
has so much for us already.
There is an inherent risk in networks spinning out of control and becoming more powerful than
expected. It is easy to see a shift in audiences' behaviour or see leaders of the network become
corrupted by the power and shifting the intention of the design. We have met this risk by
transparently opening an intentional death strategy for the network at AIME, no hidden agenda
and full intentionality towards an exit. Death is the ultimate regenerative strategy for
acceleration towards progress. It forces our hand to see our interconnectedness as
organisations, throughout all time, all connected in one large tree of life. This is precisely why we
have designed the network to work in relation, learn from our experience and then pass our
knowledge to the next generation.
The other risk is around the hero or founder worship model and around governance. We have
met this risk by centering IMAGI-NATION’s governance with 10 indicator species from Nature
(chosen as the most appropriate cultural indicator species from an Indigenous lens, whose
health represents the health of the entire global ecosystem), and we are intending to give the IP
of IMAGI-NATION back to Nature (as a well-established Indigenous practice of storing wisdom
in the landscape) once the network dies. This will be in addition to embedding our tools,
methodologies and processes into 5000+ organisations globally, reaching 1 Billion+ humans
who will walk across the bridge and become mentors for a fairer world. Our heroes are the
Natural species, and our Puppets as the custodians of imagination.
To meet the challenge that human beings can become obsessed with their own progress and
individual worth, we have built a few features. Before entering we have created a ceremony
experience where each person brings in 5 elements with them, 3 people and 2 non-human
entities to help form their core Unlikely Connections x 5 (UNCx5), to bring the time before, the
time now, and the time after with us. Also, to be in relation beyond our own species in our
grounding, each person will select one of the 10 Indicator species as their relation for their time
in IMAGI-NATION.
In order to meet the challenge of team units, we have shaped the core team as a UNCx5 crew of
people. 5 people, all unlikely connections, together in the home base, all messages can be seen
by all 5 people, engendering transparency and openness.
To meet the potential child protection challenges within the network, there is a 16+ age accesslimit, and as young people will be interacting with older people, we have removed private
inboxing; all the conversations happen in a core group of UNCx5.
Finally there is a challenge around passive engagement with the network, and we have been
explicitly clear that this is an active network, people have to work at the application phase to
apply to be engaged and be in movement before entering. This is why the AIME network of 18
years as the backbone is so important. Our established relational network is the base and
IMAGI-NATION becomes the playground for amplification of networking and action.

Durability of Impact
We believe deeply that our focus on a 10 year horizon and our drive towards zeroing in on 3 key
pillars listed below will ensure durability of impact:
1) Capacity building for 1 Billion+ humans as Mentors
2) Systems change projects
3) Suite of tools left behind
This gives us a focused spine for the work of IMAGI-NATION to beautifully and organically
emerge. AIME is but 1 organisation of which thousands will enter IMAGI-NATION, including
others who will be the ones that pick up the stage after the 10 years. We are hopeful for endless
relational economies and networks spinning up, for a focus on imagination, for mentoring
returning as our hero status, and that we have remembered just in time our natural intelligence,
our role on earth to be a custodial species.
Through the intentional death strategy we hope to lead the world in reminding us that death is
natural, that our organisations should be in relation and we’ll model a way to work together
intentionally to accelerate impact and change systemically.
We think this systems frame we have developed has the necessary complexity to work with the
world, and all of our species, and to move and dance and weave and to release a quality of action
and behaviour that can save humanity from itself just in the nick of time and release a much
richer way of networking our systems into our state of being.Emergence as a design frame
Whilst we are confident we can achieve what we have set out, we believe we will achieve a lot
more than our original plans even as there is a LOT of space for emergence. We believe we have
a frame and spine for the work and that the body can grow as it should. We have been inspired
by mycelium as a network design pattern and will ensure our network has the capacity and
space for regeneration and rich health through adaptability throughout the next 10 years. We
are at pains to not contain the impact structure as we set out on this next quest; however, our
100+ page IMPACT book will showcase the rich modelling pre-work we have done on the strong
frameworks with ample flexibility to ensure there is space for emergence and that we’re
adapting with the changing needs of the ecosystem.
Project Phases
We are building towards the launch of IMAGI-NATION in August 2023. We have already secured
our physical IMAGI-NATION{Factory} in Sydney, Australia. We have also secured our first
IMAGI-NATION{Embassy} which will hit the road by December 2022 to start directing young
people towards IMAGI-NATION via our ‘kindness economy’ connections. We have built the
design of IMAGI-NATION with JosephMark and the first phase of funding from the US$100M will
go to completing the build which we have AU$1M left to build on. We have already invested
AU$500K into the build that we received as part of our Australian Federal Government funding
in 2022. We have commenced our system wide projects listed earlier in the document, our
HUMAN/KIND/\\/KIND\HUMAN 5 year campaign launches in November 2022 at the Sunrise
Festival in Australia and our work with Music Festivals have commenced with the world’s first
introduction of Very Important Kind People (VIKP) tickets. We are a year into our work on the
Nature Fund with Ethic and the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs with the Fund set to come
to life in 2023. Regarding MentorClass, we are in conversations with some of the world’s leading
online education providers (such as Khan Academy) to jointly discover and understand how we
could share our knowledge through existing platforms and mechanisms in a deep, rich manner.
We don’t want to build our own empires, but lift the system at large. The Professors, our
Mentoring TV show for teenagers and parents, will be shared with the network at the end of
2022 and we’ve completed the development of the show. IMAGINE Film is being shared with
networks to bring Indigenous Knowledge to the general public, and is being shared with
networks at the end of 2022. Our global film festival is set to open through our Cinema in 2023
with a potential partnership on the horizon with Industrial Light and Magic, the group behind
the Star Wars series & several others. Hoodie Economics, the book about our theory of change
by our founder Jack Manning Bancroft will be published and released worldwide by Hardie
Grant in September 2023. Our IMAGI-NATION{Gallery} global campaign with M&C Saatchi will
commence once IMAGI-NATION has opened for the holiday season of 2023.
In the build up to IMAGI-NATION opening we will be following the first
IMAGI-NATION{Embassy} and creating a short documentary film as a way to let the world know
IMAGI-NATION is open, AND we are not looking for one big bang moment, we’ll keep working in
relation with the network we have, keep making unlikely connections, and over the next 10
years we are deeply confident in delivering on what we have laid out and much more for planet
earth.Testimonials

1) Go1
“The few months that we’ve engaged with AIME have already shifted our view of what
learning and mentoring could be. We’ve moved from a simple ask for training from AIME
to setting our sights on One Billion mentors with AIME. More than a number, this is our
chance to put intelligence from outside the margins to the forefront of workplace
training. Together, we can encourage people to get offline, engage with kids and then use
the tools available to them to learn from and with each other”.

Ben Richardson, Chief Content Officer | Go1
2) Thread Together
“Thread Together is driving social change through environmental action. By partnering
with the fashion industry in Australia, we are creating a blue-print to scale by diverting
brand new, unsold clothing from landfill and giving these clothes to vulnerable and
marginalised people who find themselves experiencing hardship.
It’s no secret that clothes have more than practical functions. Clothes are also used
as forms of self-expression that can signal status, individuality and personal taste.
What we wear can influence how others see us, but what’s perhaps less obvious is
how it can affect our own sense of self.
Thread Together is thrilled to partner with AIME and play our part to keep clothing in
circulation at its highest value. We are really looking forward to the ReclAIMEd Global
Festival, a global first.”

Anthony Chesler, CEO | Thread Together
3) Learning Planet
“It's a privilege to partner with AIME on the Imagination circle, exploring Imagination
for the transformation of Education. AIME inspires us as a leader of systems change, by
pushing unlikely connections, hacking traditional systems, trusting youth, and weaving
imagination throughout their work.”

Ed Stevenette, Program Manager | Learning Planet Institute
4) 4:08 Productions
"At 4:08 Productions we create stories to inspire, educate, entertain, and incite positivechange. We cannot accomplish this, at the level we aspire to, without groundbreaking
partners like AIME.
4:08 Productions is currently working with AIME to develop, and bring to life, the
animated feature film "IMAGINE." We are honoured to help shine light on the
far-too-often marginalised voices, knowledge, and cultural importance of Indigenous
people.
Through our partnership with AIME, we will imbue IMAGINE's narrative with powerful
systems of Indigenous knowledge, to help unlock our imaginations, and to build a
healthier, happier, and more sustainable planet. The end result will be a wildly
compelling animated feature film that will be shared for decades to come.
4:08 Productions is a proud partner of AIME and all that they are doing to make a more
compassionate, thoughtful, playful and kinder planet."

5) Festival Partners re Kindness Economy
“At Fuzzy we are always on the lookout for partners that understand our core business
which is all about connection. Partnering with AIME on the Festivals Kindness Initiative
helped celebrate our customers and connect them with each other.”
- Adelle Robinson, Managing Director | Fuzzy
“At Untitled Group, our core ethos is to prioritise areas of social change. As a team, we
are very excited to be collaborating with AIME to build bridges with different
communities, engage with Indigenous thinking and take creative action. Throughout the
years, we have deepened our partnership with AIME as a KindFest, as well as through
other social impact initiatives, such as ticket donations, site activations, and events,
internships, and mentorship. The opportunity to participate in the Kindness Economy at
Beyond the Valley this year has been an incredible experience, and we look forward to
continuing to support AIME into the future.”

Fil Palermo, Managing Director | Untitled Group
“Sunrise is our flagship creativity and startup festival. Our aim is to change Australian
culture, and AIME is central to helping us to shape a more kind and human experience.
At first, we approached Jack to keynote, and from there, we expanded our partnership to
launching HUMAN\KIND\//\KIND/HUMAN. The Sunrise event is richer for having
kindness presented in such a connected way, and we look forward to being part of
AIME's 5-year vision to share as much kindness in this world as possible."

Details on the USD$100M
Non-Profits / charities are often asked “how are you going to be sustainable?” The
answer to the question is that we are not trying to be sustainable forever, but for the next 10
years. And the $100M funding we raise will cover our costs for the entire duration.
Our main expenditure is focused on
● the people we employ to activate the relational network globally,
● the development of the tools to shape systemic change,
● the travel to move people around to make unlikely connections, and
● the running of the IMAGI-NATION platform.
A 10 year strategic spend that will change the way the world works and how it is networked; an
investment in the future we have described. We'll secure US$100M before October 2023, so
when we launch IMAGI-NATION we can be completely relational in our network patterns,
moving money to the side, and show what can happen with a small injection of, for example,
US$10M from 10 separate donors.
This is how 1 billion people can be activated as mentors, how systems can be shifted, and how
tools in the shape of rich story can be left behind for the benefit of the human race forever.
Our network that attended the IMAGI-NATION event in October this year has pushed us
past the starting line. Now it's your chance to turn interest into action and build a fairer
world with us.IMAGI-NATION: A network of networks built on
unlikely connections & a lab for humanity to solve
the challenges of our times
AIME:
We have 18+ years of track record in shifting deep entrenched systems by bridging
marginalised youth & communities in 52+ countries by valuing their intelligence with people
& organisations with power to create a healthy relational network, and an alternative
economic framework, validated by independent research from Harvard, KPMG,
world-leading Universities, systems thinkers & more.
IMAGI-NATION:
We’re now digitising all this and fusing the best of humanity powered by the internet to
create a virtual nation, IMAGI-NATION, led by Indigenous systems knowledge to unite all
other Nations, launching at the end of 2023. This relational digital network will be for all
people from inside and outside the margins, and 50+ of some of humanity’s best
organisations & networks, to come together in unlikely connections and rewire our unhealthy
systems & solve the challenges of our times.
INTENTIONAL DEATH / IP TO NATURE:
To counter the current limitless growth mindset & model a healthy regenerative sustainable
system, AIME & IMAGI-NATION have an intentional death date set for March 2033, after
which we cease operations & return our IP back to Nature and the ecosystem around us.
IMPACT:
We're building a measurement system that brings numbers, stories, ripple effect, network
potential over time and other dimensions into play for a multidimensional view of impact.
The big prize is returning humanity to our custodial relationship with each other and Nature
by centering imagination as the critical skill to get us there, and by using mentoring as the
methodology to allow this knowledge to be transferred freely across generations. We will:
● Model a relational network, connecting us to people and ideas we’ll never likely
encounter and change the way the world works by providing a scalable alternative to
the current sick social networks of today without their self-serving algorithms.
● Unearth for humanity the most enduring source of human knowledge on the planet -
Indigenous systems thinking, fusing it with the best of modern knowledge systems to
support the world’s largest lab of co-design within complex systems.
● Create an ecosystem of activated stakeholders (see following point); completing
100+ systems change projects to showcase scalable impact and shifting current
unhealthy systems at play in education, employment, finance, fashion, sustainability
etc.; and leaving behind 50+ valuable tools, designed to continue to shape the design
of our living systems well into the future.
ACTIVATED STAKEHOLDERS:
Through IMAGI-NATION, the following key stakeholder groups will be activated directly, with
each of these having the potential to impact millions of humans thereafter:
1. 1000 Indigenous Knowledge Systems Labs created and networked as the key
decentralised knowledge network across all of Earth’s bio-regions
2. 1M young people from marginalised communities establishing custodial economies
to return humankind back to Nature as IMAGI-NATION Presidents3. 1000 cities / councils accredited in Imagination / Custodianship / Mentoring
4. 1000 organisations accredited as JOY Corps to redesign themselves in healthier
patterns for their employees, communities and natural ecosystems
5. 1000 schools becoming Imagination Labs and working on systemic solutions
6. 1000 systems change citizens unlocked and networked to solve world problems
7. 1000 Universities training students as mentors for knowledge transference
8. 1000 Very Important Kind People accredited and celebrated at 100 Kindfests to
model a kindness economy for the world
9. 1000 art galleries accredited as IMAGI-NATION Galleries using art and imagination
as tools for systemic change
BUDGET / RESOURCES REQUIRED:
All of the projected impact and all of our operations will be delivered at a cost of $10M p.a.
For IMAGI-NATION, we’re inviting philanthropic contributions of $500k+ p.a. from key
systemic funders for the next 10 years to cover the entire network’s impact, and this is
delineated in this link (also linked in the header of this section).
NB: We have raised and invested $150M+ in-currency, and $200M+ in-kind since 2005. We
have also confirmed initial seed funding for the technology & network from the Australian
Government of $500k, as part of a $13.5M philanthropic package.

Introduction & Headline on Communications
To be able to change the world on the scale which it is needed, we cannot tell our story alone. We
believe with an alliance of unlikely connections in the form of agencies and brands, we can share the
load on the creation of unlikely connections, and build the power of the next social network, a social
network for good.
This Brand book walks you through AIME, it gives you the history, it gives you the callouts, it unlocks
some pathways for storytelling. We share the AIME Design Brain we use to ensure we’ve birthed an
AIME idea, and finally the channels AIME has to create unlikely connections.
Now I didn’t want to bury the lead - we deeply believe that every campaign, every story, starts with
manual one to one connections, that marketing requires human to human connection, and we don’t
believe in one big story that suddenly goes viral: we don’t like viruses, we don’t like unhealthy growth.
We are in this for the long game. The current dislocated media landscape is not who we require for
verification. We want to build the connections one by one, and if the work is meaningful, then people
may talk about it, but if not, the work is done. We focus our campaigns solely on the creation of the
unlikely connections, not on who's watching.We don’t think facebook, instagram or twitter are strong arenas for communication at a level of depth
that changes things. If your strategy involves them, delete your strategy, focus on the offline world, or
on platforms that give space for depth, like podcasts or youtube. Remove the artificial, the distraction,
the desperation for a quick result or a quick outcome and please please please build it slowly with us.
One by one, in the shadows if we must, we’ll slowly keep building an incredibly meaningful social
network for good that brings in the intelligence of all humankind.
Thank you for creating unlikely connections with us for a fairer world

About AIME
In 2004, AIME founder Jack Manning Bancroft, sketched an idea of a social network for good, one
that connected university students as mentors with Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander high school
students in Australia, building bridges between two different groups, to lead to educational equity,
exchanges of worth and value, and for the mentors a deeper connection to a different lived
experience.
In 2005, this network commenced and scaled at pace around Australia engaging over 25,000
Indigenous high school students who closed a 40% education outcome gap, and it lit up the minds of
a generation of university students desperate to connect to something bigger than themselves, with
over 10,000 university students volunteering their time and energy to make AIME the largest ongoing
volunteer movement of university students in Australian history.The power of AIME to build unlikely connections grew as we encountered further barriers to the high
school students’ pathway out of inequity - barriers in mass cultural storytelling where they couldn’t see
anyone like them, barriers in employment, barriers in the board rooms, barriers in the shape of the
economy that saw so many kids like them outside the margins.
One by one, we’ve worked tirelessly on building bridges between these young people and the people
in control of many of the friction points where change has not yet occurred, but is possible if we
embrace unlikely connections.
The more our work grew around Australia, the more we realised the largest challenge to inequity was
not limited by national borders; it was all interlinked. It was how we saw each other, how we saw
people outside the margins, how we valued exchange, and the amount of the pie there was to go
around globally.
In 2016, we expanded our work across the globe, which has led to the invention of our own TV
network, our own radio show, our own University to train people to make unlikely connections and
which in 2021 is reaching people across 52 countries. We scaled our work in fashion, with our Hoodie
to drive into youth culture with a symbol that was more than an empty brand promise, a symbol that
showed the true power of fashion for good.
We are in the process of bringing all of this work into an online world, contained in one social network,
where we can model a different economy of exchange where everyone is included, and where there
are bridges for those in positions of power who want to see things change, but don’t know where to
find a marginalised young person, or connect to a different way of thinking. Our network will build
these bridges driven by the power of unlikely connections.
While nation states have struggled to find solutions that bridge the divides, we have decided to call
our new network, IMAGI-NATION, a new nation, where everyone has a seat at the table, and where
we are all invited to make an unlikely connection and help build a fairer world.

https://player.fm/series/the-other-others/positivity-meets-complexityWhat is AIME?
AIME is ‘unlikely connections’ for a fairer world. We are a network that connects
marginalised youth with the rest of the world to make space for exchanges of time,
knowledge, opportunities to create more bridges between those inside the margins and
those outside so we can realise a fairer world.

What is UNCx5?
Unlikely Connections times five - it’s the formula to unlock the power of unlikely connections
and the key to open up the world of IMAGI-NATION. To create change, we don't need an
island, or thousands of Instagram followers, or be a LinkedIn influencer. All we need is 5
incredible Unlikely Connections, and watch the many infinite new connections into
experiences, knowledges, perspectives that explode when 5 people go deep in a smaller
circle - in a network that is decentralised and includes us all.
What’s AIME’s vision?
Creating millions of unlikely connections between marginalised youth and those inside the
margins AND between all human beings and different ways of thinking in order to create a
fairer world.
What is the problem AIME is solving?
Our current connections work towards a concentration of wealth and opportunity for the few,
a confirmation of our biases, more time with people like us
What’s the solution?
Unlikely connections, between races, ages, wealth, nations.
How has AIME made the solution?
Two parallel pathways - connecting people with stories and knowledge, and connecting
people with each other.
The stories and knowledge come through AIME’s Hoodie, TV, Radio, Film, Gallery, Library &
University.
The connections are facilitated via AIME’s online social network for good & in our physical
work in Universities & schools worldwide - IMAGI-NATION, AIME’s university
IMAGI-NATION {University}, and via AIME’s meeting place within IMAGI-NATION, a globalexchange portal where marginalised youth can connect with mentors, internships,
scholarships and jobs.
What’s the difference between AIME and IMAGI-NATION?
AIME is the organisation, IMAGI-NATION is the network.
How do we measure success?
By counting the unlikely connections created.
And then by tracking through case studies, the deeper impact short, medium, long term of
those unlikely connections.
How not to talk about AIME
Okay here’s some watchouts. Avoid these:
●The Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience - AIME was founded as an
Australian unlikely connector between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, it’s
now grown to 50+ countries. QANTAS used to be the Queensland and Northern
Territory Airline Association, it’s now just QANTAS. AIME’s origin story is part of the
heartbeat of the organisation, and it is told with subtlety and nuance, by having a
global stage where Indigenous Australian young people stand alongside other young
people outside the margins, and people inside the margins, and in that statement, on
a global stage, we see the ultimate equity achieved for Indigenous people in Aus.
That equity is that there are no ceilings, there are no doors closed to their possibility,
their identity is their power and their story, not to limit them, but to unleash them.
●“Indigenous Australian and other marginalised youth” - this reinforces the negative
twice. We want the audience to understand the global inequality faced by young
people who because of historical circumstances, because of societal design, have
landed in a life that they are outside the margins. Calling out Indigenous Australians
and then other marginalised youth does a double otherising. Back to the simple
message “AIME connects young people outside the margins with a network of those
inside the margins to build exchanges to create a fairer world.”
●Awareness - AIME isn’t about awareness, we aren’t here to tell people about the
problem of inequity, to dwell on the past, AIME is about solutions, AIME is about
tomorrow, AIME is about action, about really simple action where people make an
unlikely connection with knowledge through our storytelling, are inspired to act
through our storytelling, or are connected in unlikely ways via AIME’s network.
○ Particular callout on the AIME Hoodie - the AIME Hoodie is the most activated
meaningful Hoodie in the world. No hoodie we make is about awareness. For
example:
■ Making Space Hoodie is a Gallery - it exhibits the work of
marginalised youth from around the world & it also exhibits the work of■
■
●
profile artists giving their profile and work to raise $ and bring people
to connect with the AIME network and make more unlikely
connections.
Making Space Hoodie is a ticket - to the global Making Space
exhibition where the world’s marginalised youth are exhibited on the
walls of the most prestigious galleries around the planet.
Making Space Hoodie is not awareness building about the plight of
inequity.
AIME is the anti charity. If there’s anything you’ve seen before in public fundraising,
gala balls, flip the script on it because AIME doesn’t want to give to people what they
already know, we don’t give them what they’ve already got, because that is not an
unlikely connection with an idea, with a way of thinking. We want people to see AIME
as the ideal organisation on planet earth, not your usual charity, not noble, but
normal.
How to talk about AIME
● Unlikely connections for a fairer world.
● Ask a question - What unlikely connection with an idea, with a person, has changed
your life for good?
● We are the anti facebook - AIME is the network of tomorrow - built for everyone, not
affirming what we know and who we know, but connecting us to what we don’t know
and who we don’t know, not for entertainment, but for good.
● Action action action - focus on the action, the impact, the outcome, the unlikely
connections, how one unlikely connection after another we can change things. Map
the impact, showcase how the idea is changing the world.
● Borrow - borrow from all different organisations, stories, ideas, and fuse the unlikely
connections.
● Imaginatively create stories that are fuelled by unlikely connections. If you have a
young person from outside the margins and someone from inside the margins you
are on your way. If they are activated and working proactively on a project of
tomorrow, and the young person is shown with strength, with agency, not as a
problem to be fixed, but the solution, then you are well on your way.
● DO IT - don’t overthink it, don’t over strategise it. Make sure the passion for what we
are doing - the fairer world we are fighting for, is alive. When this is alive, we are
alive, we’ll learn from the doing.
● Always drafting - embrace an idea that we are always drafting. This links in with the
doing of it. If we know we are creating unlikely connections, then let’s get out there
and do it.
Our Spokespeople
● Our Lead spokespeople are our 6 Professors. They transcend our literal
representations of race and identity and allow us to move into a place of imagination.
They are multidimensional, they are challenging and complex. We want our
professors doing media spots, public speaking events, representing AIME.
○ Profile on each please Josh Buoy Vanessa Ellis Benjamin Knight
● AIME Ambassadors - 200 young people from around the worldWhere and how to activate AIME’s unlikely connections
Our social network for good, since 2005 has focused on real life, real world interactions
between human beings, creating unlikely connections one by one.
We see the power of the internet to connect and are developing our own digital social
network for good to be released in 2022.
We are very wary of the trap of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and would prefer the use of
these platforms to drive physical action. For example:
● Making Space campaign - Post from an artist at a gallery asking their gallery to join
the Making Space Exhibition globally
● Making Space campaign - an employer inviting other businesses to join the making
space club
What we dig less is ‘awareness’: “I’m wearing this hoodie, I’m cool therefore marginalised
youth are cool” We aren’t so into that, we’d prefer action. Eg:
● I’m wearing this hoodie with a callout to any young artists from outside the margins
who want to have a chance to be exhibited at the Louvre in this year’s MAKING
SPACE exhibition and have your own work created into a custom Art Hoodie via
AIME’s IMAGI-NATION{Gallery}, head to aimementoring.com to apply.
Ensure there are unlikely connections from the inception through to the delivery of the idea
and impact tracking & storytelling afterwards.
If it builds the network of unlikely connections, if it leads to action = good.
If it talks about how good AIME is = not so good.
Remember - not the past, but the future. Not the problem, but the solution. That every single
communication piece from us is an opportunity to create an unlikely connection with a new
piece of knowledge, a different way of thinking, or a person, that leads to a fairer world.
How to birth an AIME Idea
This is our AIME brain, it’s what’s required to create an AIME idea. If you have ticked all of
these, it’s an AIME idea. We believe in knowledge to change the world, that’s why we have a
philosophy checklist; we believe that economics drives what we value and to change the
world, we must influence economic exchanges; we see art and artistic thinking as leading an
idea, birthing a reality, a bridge between imagination and what we know; and finally, we
believe in robust engineering to ensure we change the system, and the idea can move from
imagination to actionable change. Below is the graphic we work through to ensure we have
designed an AIME idea. And we’ll share a short description of each section.Philosophy
Star Dust
● Does this idea live after it’s been created, is there a vision where it explodes, and the
star dust that is left helps the whole earth?
Freedom
● Are we working on freeing people’s minds? Or helping them enter a space of
imagination? Are we suspending disbelief? Are we flipping the script on how we
think? Are we releasing all sides/different people from their existing biases and
allowing for freedom of thought to see unlikely pathways as realities?
Knowledge
● Is there knowledge shared as part of the idea? Not surface awareness but deep
knowledge transfer? Do we change the way people think? Is there depth to the idea?
Create a fairer world?
● Does this action create a fairer world? How will we prove it?
Economics
● Exchange of Time, Knowledge, Opportunities
○ Does this idea focus on an exchange of time, knowledge and opportunities?
Does it provide the space for those involved to share across the margins? Is
cash kicked down the line as a barrier to entry? Are there moneyless
exchanges leading?●
IMAGI-NATION - Social Network for Good
○ Does it bring the audience to IMAGI-NATION to act?
○ Does it inspire the audience to network differently, to network with unlikely
connections?
Artists
● Make a statement
○ Does the idea grab you? Does it make a statement? Have we distilled the
essence of it into a headline? Is the statement something we can stand for?
● Always drafting
○ Does the idea have fingerprints all over it? Have we embraced ‘always
drafting’ as a concept in design? Have we let the audience into the process of
creation? Have we created a bridge between them and us by being human,
by drafting with them? Have we co-created? And have we released ourselves
from perfection by releasing the idea, then drafting with the world?
● Imagine
○ Have we harnessed the power of our collective and individual imaginations
with the idea? Have we truly deeply imagined what’s possible? Is the idea
predictable or imaginative? Have we used the principle of unlikely
connections in the birthing of the idea to ensure it is imaginative?
● Layers and levels
○ Is there depth to the work? Are there multiple layers and levels at play? Does
it work today and tomorrow? Is there complexity in the approach?
● Play with the frame
○ Have we looked at the existing frame and played with it? Have we drawn
outside the margins? Have we changed the frame? Have we played with the
assumptions of what the playground is? Have we, in the very act of adjusting
the frame, expanded the margins? Have we made the frame bigger to help
others see bigger? Have we made more space?
Engineering
● Impact
○ What is the measurable impact of unlikely connections created from the
campaign? What are the numbers of young people from outside the margins
that will have unlikely connections because of this idea? How are we going to
capture the case study impact of the work? In what format? What changes
because of the idea? And can you prove it with hard facts? With numbers and
stories?
● Repeatable
○ Is the idea repeatable? Can it scale globally? Can it grow year on year?
Could it last for 20 years?
● Shift the system from the inside
○ Does the idea bring those people from inside the margins onto the bridge to
make an unlikely connection with those outside the margins? Have we
inspired those inside the margins to act, then given them a pathway and
responsibility to do the work?
○ Does it have a design that moves beyond a day? Does it have a club/ a
system/ a campaign/ a peer-to-peer device/ cultural pressure that moves the●
●
●
work back into the hands of those within the margins to create the change
themselves?
○ What levers are we pulling on to make the system move?
Long Game
○ Have we imagined what happens with this idea in 100 years’ time? Have we
thought about what happens in 1000 years’ time? Have we released
ourselves from a measurement of success being an instant ‘like’, to thinking
about the long game? Have we resisted the pressure of “big news” results, to
think one-by-one about how we can build the idea year-on-year, to create the
snowball, into the avalanche of change? Is there patience in the design?
Who's at the table?
○ Are people from outside the margins at the table in the design of the idea? Do
we have unlikely connections at play the whole way through?
Give kids the stage
○ Does the idea make a stage and then give the stage to young people outside
the margins to show they are not a problem to be fixed but part of the
solution?
○ Are young people involved in the design process?
○ How do the young people take their opportunities from the idea and become
leaders that pass it on and create more opportunities for young people like
themselves?
The AIME Unlikely Connection Channels
IMAGI-NATION {University}
Where AIME educates & inspires people in how to make unlikely connections to act for a
fairer world. Students complete their courses over 10 months.
There are five degree courses and five key audiences:
● Executives - who work on creating a Co-CEO in their organisation and levelling the
playing field in their workplace
● University students - who lead an AIME student chapter and create mentoring
connections between university student mentors and 100 marginalised high school
students
● Teachers - who teach with imagination to engage ALL students in the classroom and
build bridges to local employers & community
● Entrepreneurs - for school students from outside the margins to become
entrepreneurs and create change from the inside out (and for those within the
margins to build unlikely connections back to those outside)
● Citizens - for individuals to work on projects for change within their communities or
the world
Via IMAGI-NATION {University}, by 2024, AIME is looking to create unlikely connections for
90K marginalised youth per year.
Here are 5 case studies of students enrolled in 2021IMAGI-NATION {TV}
A weekly TV show where we curate unlikely connections. This is where we incubate ideas,

Always drafting
We are always drafting. We have released ourselves from perfection and embraced the idea that our
work is always a draft. It’s never finished, never perfect.
Asking questions
One of our 18 values. Asking questions allows us to move from what we already know to what we
don’t yet know.
Asterix
Professor of Hoodie Economics at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Asterix is a philosopher combined

questions through her research to redefine how we think about adding value in our world – pursuing
an exchange of time and experience instead of just money.
Blue
Professor of Flipping the Script at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Blue knows that self-authorship and an
entrepreneurial mindset are integral in order to move oneself outside the dominant narrative. His
fundamental lesson in flipping the script: “I don’t have to play a part in someone else’s story”. Blue
wants to help write a curriculum for all students to see themselves in a new light at IMAGI-NATION
{University}.BRAVE goals

Co-CEO
The Co-CEO program looks at levelling the playing field and making boardrooms more diverse and

available to those who get a seat at the decision-making table.
Empathy
One of our 18 values. Empathy is feeling with the heart of another person.
Einstein
Professor of Building Bridges at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Einstein wrote a paper as a sociology
grad student in the 1970’s based on a phenomenon she gathered from her research: instead of going
from A to B and B to C, what if we just built a bridge from A to C? Now she’s getting recruited by
leaders around the world to talk about building bridges. The problem is: she’s not sure it’s going to
work...
Energy
Professor of Mentoring at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Energy is on a lifelong quest to pass on
knowledge. She earned her PhD in mentoring; she loves the Plato/Socrates relationship; she’s
obsessed with seeing knowledge passed down from generation to generation. If she wants to tell you
something, she’ll tell you a parable. She knows that if you want to change the world, you need to
connect with people through stories.

Failure Time
An ingredient of pop-up IMAGI-NATION {Factory} days. A confidence and resilience-building session

One of our 18 values. Hard work and discipline are the gears behind change. It’s not always pretty but
it’s completely necessary.
Hoodie
The AIME Hoodie is the most meaningful Hoodie in the world. Since 2010, it has been the currency of
IMAGI-NATION and our device for change. We ask people to act, to stand up and create change, and
in exchange, we give them a hoodie to say “Thank you for fighting for a fairer world.”
Hoodie Economics
One the 6 knowledge fields taught at IMAGI-NATION {University}. The economy that underpins AIME:
elevating the exchange of time, knowledge and opportunity above money.
Hope
One of our 18 values. Hope is believing in a better future and working to make it happen
Hope
Professor of Imagination at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Hope knows that hope doesn’t come easy:
it’s always a struggle. He’s trying as hard as possible to build that bridge between reality and unreality.
Hope feels the heaviness of hope; he carries this giant burden and responsibility – all the while
thinking: “Don’t make me carry this alone!” Hope is the epitome of hard work: he knows you don’t get
to opt out of the work if you want to change the world.Imagination
One the 6 knowledge fields taught at IMAGI-NATION {University}. Imagination is the beginning of
human thought and action.
IMAGI-NATION
