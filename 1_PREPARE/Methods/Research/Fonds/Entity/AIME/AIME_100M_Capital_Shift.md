IMAGI-NATION
A relational network.
With imagination as the doorway in.
Powered by unlikely connections.
To invest in our intelligence.
To invest in Kindness, Joy, and Nature.
To change the way the world is networked
& solve the challenges of our time.
A LAB for humanity, driven by creating a meeting place for 5 of the key groups on earth that
shape the way the world moves to 1) our organisations; 2) our higher educational institutes; 3)
our schools; 4) our citizens; and 5) up until this point, our systemically marginalised youth
whose systems design intelligence is what we are missing as a species.
IMAGI-NATION will only have 1.4 Million citizens, including the following 5 groups:
1 Million Presidents of IMAGI-NATION will rise from the world's marginalised youth. The
IMAGI-NATION Presidents will all be working on projects to return humanity to our
custodial relations with NATURE.
1000 Higher Educational Institutes will work towards becoming Mentoring Universities, to
be networked beyond the University gates, to the most marginalised school students,
and to focus on knowledge shared not knowledge kept as a philosophy.
1000 Organisations will work towards becoming JOY Corps by shaping themselves
inside and out from the boardroom to the front door, to being more in relation, to nature,
to kindness, to Joy.
1000 Schools will unleash their potential by re-invigorating imagination throughout the
schools DNA and becoming Imagination classrooms, activating and unleashing the
intelligence of our young people into the system right now.
●
1000 citizens will be shaped as systems change organisers with the capacity to see the
full map at large, and work with the enormity of this blue moving dot we call home,
amongst the universe.
Meeting Place for the largest cross-pollinated, focused talent pool fusing intelligence from
outside and inside the margins, and creating a jobs portal like nothing else on earth, focused,
generative, limited, a club that's intentionally inclusive, that doesn't ask for $$ to pay for ads, but
asks Universities, Schools, Organisations and Citizens to work to earn their reputational credit.
To work on their own change to shape the system.
The kids outside the margins aren't the problem to be fixed, they are the solution when given the
    stage. In IMAGI-NATION 1M marginalised youth will be in the centre, driving projects to re-vive
our custodial ways with nature. From this base of deep intelligence, they will enter the relations
with the other people, as valuable intelligent beings, as systems designers. We are not sick, the
network is, and we don't fix that by buying our way out with advertising, we shift it by shifting our
collective energy and effort allowing us to move all of the pathways of our relations can be
nudged, moved, shaped. We are the network. We are the economists, our attention and
intention shapes value and this includes shaping our mindsets to take an imagination, mentor,
systems change, unlikely connections, relational mindset.
IMAGI-NATION Passports can't be bought, they can't be gamed, they must be earned, through
relations. This hub will be one of the most significant generative talent and intelligence hubs
earth has seen. And for the 10 years of existence, the job of those inside IMAGI-NATION is not
to sit in the ivory tower, but to take our time in IMAGI-NATION to enhance and unleash the
potential of all life on EARTH.
Beyond IMAGI-NATON's borders is Earth, and we see our role as planetary, in fact as galactic.
We are energy currents in the whole universe, and we don't see nation borders, we don't see
racial borders, we see 7 million other species on the rock we call home, we see 20 billion other
animals, and we see a universe of which we only know 4% of what we might know. Our work in
IMAGI-NATION must be transferred into KNOWLEDGE openly shared, which in its ideal format
is shaped into TOOLS, which when activated in their deepest richest forms, are STORY, deep
long story.
We tell STORY through TOOLS to help humanity be CONTENT. We don't shape CONTENT to
make humanity feel insecure, hopeless, lost, isolated and want to buy our freedom. We remind
humanity through STORY and TOOLS that our freedom is always here, in our imagination, in
our ability for original thought.
After our 10 years as IMAGI-NATION, we will gift all of the IP from the network and from AIME
back to NATURE, to restore modern songlines, to restore nature as our source of intelligence, to
shift economies from preservation to intelligent relations with nature. The original IP holder is
NATURE, we are NATURE's AI. Every idea, every one of us, and when our economies value
this relation, we'll find our way.
People will hear about IMAGI-NATION in a few ways. For starters IMAGI-NATION is built by
AIME which has an established global community, across 52 countries. AIME has already raised
$150M in the last 20 years, and generated significant systemic change. From this network core,
the digital IMAGI-NATION will be birthed. Some of the spaces we are shaping to connect people
to IMAGI-NATION will be revealed on the following pages. Below are some of the organisations
working with AIME on IMAGI-NATION.
These are the wisdom holders and mentors who are custodians of IMAGI-NATION.
Festival will be one of our key spaces to build a bridge between IMAGI-NATION & Planet Earth.
Working with Festivals around the world, we will work to centre Kindness Economics. Through
the introduction of Very Important Kind People, we will work on deep, deep Story to then work
with human beings when they have time away from the distraction platforms and devices, and
space to reclaim deeper moments of thinking and movement. We already have the following
Festival partners we have worked on this model with.
Factory in Sydney, Australia, in the heart of the entertainment district is the AIME
IMAGI-NATION Factory - the physical home for the laboratory of IMAGI-NATION's work. It's the
home of IMAGI-NATION{University} and The Professors (AIME's Muppet Show/Sesame Street)
TV Show is filmed at the IMAGI-NATION{Factory}. It's the lobby for the deeper fusion of
systems projects arising in IMAGI-NATION and the physical soul of the network.
Embassy is defined as the ambassadors of AIME's work. 20,000+ hoodies around the world
moving the AIME mindsets and values with four continents hosting AIME staff.
Five physical vehicles will travel around the world heading out to Schools. We will create &
leave behind 10,000 Imagination Classrooms over the next 10 years.
We will fuse the network between those inside and outside the margins by linking JOY Corps,
Mentoring Universities and Citizens to the Schools.
The First Embassy is currently on the Road in Australia.
The value of IMAGI-NATION to restore Earth's relational networks so we don't go over 1.5°C, to
work out how to live with robots and keep investing in our imagination, to shape economies that
are relational and can live with robots and automation, to bring people together across nation
states, to stop the rot of democracy with the division created by modern network models that
affirm what we know and who we know, to reclaim our attention and arrest our desperate spiral
to forever distraction.
This value is so far beyond what we are looking for in terms of financial investment. We are
looking at 10M a year over 10 years, secured upfront as 100M, so we can then say no to any
further financial contributions to protect against network corruption and moving from the
intentionality of the design. The main spend goes towards our staff, and the development of our
story, which again is mainly an employment cost, beyond this there is some investment in
bringing our team together around the world to tell big STORIES, and to ensure our
EMBASSIES are safe and can move to build the 10,000 Classrooms and beyond.
The Death For life, IMAGI-NATION has set an intentional death date, 10 years from March
2023, to ensure we are working towards systemic health for the whole network of organisations
and people around us at large. The clock has begun ticking. We have no hidden agenda. This is
open source - all knowledge will be shared, all IP returned to Nature. This is an intentional
10-year sprint at a key time in human history which also means we can be accurate with the
limitations of our needs. We don't want for more than 100M to make this real over the decade.
The Economics We desperately want to help humanity move our $$ towards nature, joy,
kindness, and to valuing relational economies, time, reclaiming processes, and finding the
fusion between the efficiency and growth that has got us here, with the intelligence that's been
around since we were birthed as a species.
In order to give IMAGI-NATION the greatest chance to create the most significant set of
economic case studies we are offering numerous playgrounds for financial capital to be
deployed as part of the 100M. On the following pages, we have mapped the Economic
movement and shapes for investment, and below we have listed some of the arenas:
R&D for Humanity
○ Government Grants
○ Philanthropic Investors
○ Research Investment
Story
○ Ownership investment model - 10-20M in total, 1-2M per year
○ Film and TV Grants and Production partnerships
Soul in Festivals
○ Government Kindness Economic R&D
○ Philanthropic Investors
Relational Economics
○ Exchanging Space, Time, Knowledge, Skills
Tokenomics
○ NFT - of The Professors - modern valuation of research and knowledge projects
○ Hoodie Economics
■ Inside IMAGI-NATION
■ Passports will be the Reputational Marker for achievements - the
modern CV - which will then be the currency at The Meeting Place
and Beyond IMAGI-NATION
■ Physical Hoodies & Digital Hoodies will be released by the
Re-Serve Bank to stimulate economy in IMAGI-NATION
■ Outside IMAGI-NATION
■
Reputational Currency of Hoodie Economics could see
IMAGI-NATION Citizens gain access to Festivals, to housing
opportunities, to transport, to food.
There are enough playgrounds to see the $$ move in. We are really interested in how to group
these $$ to create Economic language and case studies around the return on investment, which
we'll share the frames for on the following page.
The return Within IMAGI-NATION for investors there can be the following returns:
● $ Returns - you can make money here - through investments in Story and our business
venture partner who shapes our Story work; through our NFT work; through our relations
with other business ventures that are for profit.
● NATURE returns - The NATURE fund is the largest project at scale which promises
NATURE and financial returns. Within IMAGI-NATION, we have been building examples
of our research becoming systems change projects, like our Seaweed Hoodie Project to
reforest Sydney's Coastline. There is other R&D which has huge potential around
IMAGI-NATION's IP Return to Nature and much more.
● Reputational Returns - via JOY Corps, Presidents, Mentoring Univeristy's, Systems
Change Citizens, Imagination Schools, Hoodies and Passports
● Return on Relations - we believe investors will be more intelligent and mapped healthily
by having time with IMAGI-NATION
● Knowledge Return via R&D - amongst all of this, there is no question IMAGI-NATION is
Planet Earth's R&D Lab We are here for us all. This a space for emergence to grow, to
invest in the philosophy and relations, in the 20 years of work before it, and to know this
is not merely charity $$
● Tool Return - R&D without the Tools is knowledge on the shelf that no one uses. Tools
without relevance have no utility value and are wasted investments. Our tools via
imagination focus on big story. They have the potential and capacity to last and stand the
test of time, like our models around the Co-CEO lever, or UNCx5 organisation patterns,
Mentor Training or MentorClass, and at scale, our greatest gift is mindset tools and
processes for thinking with mindsets of imagination, mentoring, relations, unlikely
connections and systems change.
Introduction
Welcome to IMAGI-NATION
The new country for planet Earth, a place to model relational economics, to use imagination
powered by unlikely connections x 5 to solve the challenges of our time and create the systemic
solutions needed for planet Earth. Welcome to a global R&D lab, bringing in the best of us-all at
this critical juncture in human history, as we stare down mass, global challenges for human kind.
Through IMAGI-NATION, we will:
● Centre Indigenous systems thinking and other systematically marginalised intelligence to
help humanity unlock it's custodial patterns
● Centre and value nature and have it be the primary driving force of our economies
● Unlock imagination in our classrooms, and JOY in our workplaces
● Shift the behaviour of the fashion industry to circularity, through reclaiming our making
and shaping processes
● Re-imagine the festival experience around the world. We'll have a gallery that pushes
the limits of imagination and shifts where we move wealth to and from, with a strong NFT
experience. From music to film festivals, we will centre of kindness within our experience
through the introduction of the Very Important Kind People (VIKP)
● Re-invigorate global gatherings of youth, like the UN Youth Council, with 1 Million
IMAGI-NATION Presidents from outside the margins coming together to drive the
network forward, with a focus on restoring and reviving our relations with nature. This will
provide a network space for the generation of unlikely relationships and one of the most
focused employment portals in the world for young people from outside the margins who
should be valued as systems change thinkers and doers
● Gather together and share openly. This is an open source knowledge project. It is an
imagination wikipedia, focused on mindsets - including the mentor mindset - which we
believe is the key to the continuity of human civilisation since our origin
● Tell immense stories with soul, recapturing the essence of film and TV, of theatre and
magic, and we'll move people with hope, joy, possibility and imagination
This document is for investors looking to engage in the world and work of IMAGI-NATION. We
have budgeted that we can achieve all of this, and we believe more, for US$100M over a
10-year period, equating to $10M a year.
We want to set limitations on financial capital and are looking to raise the full $100M by October
2023. Then we want to model relational economics in full.
To understand the philosophy underpinning the work, we invite you to read Hoodie Economics
which will be released in September 2023.
This is AIME's strategy to work on the flow of $100M to create a series of investment case
studies that can shift the way global and local economies shape value.
A series of circles have emerged. These circles are the investment pipelines towards relational
economies. We have one rule:
NFT - The Professors
1) The circle must be able to be copied at scale. This is a precedent. We are providing a
systemic case study - a bright spot to then become a bright system. A circle for 1000s of
circles. Cellular health and wealth, for now and beyond. A network in relations.
We are turning The Professors at IMAGI-NATION{University} into NFTs to create new
opportunities for AIME as an R&D innovation lab. The cultural, economic, and social benefits of
turning these puppets into NFTs include preserving their legacy, generating new revenue
streams, exposing them to new audiences, and creating educational opportunities for owners.
By leveraging the latest technology whilst maintaining a relational mindest, AIME can continue
to innovate and create unique and engaging stories while generating income to reinvest in
research and development.
A conversation that might help with your comprehension can be found here.

UNDERNEATH IMAGI-NATION
Network Philosophy
AIME is a 20 year case study - of patterning networks and systems design in relation;
knowledge in relation; of practical behavioural economics with the prize of valuing the heart of
humanity; our relations to each other, to nature, and to time before us and afterwards.
We’ve inherited networks that were shaped to channel natural resources and labour into wealth
through money and financial capital for a handful of colonial empires. These networks were not
built for all. They were built for a few, where the coin became the modality to track debt, to move
wealth back and forth between the Kings and Queens.
How can we adapt and generate healthier networks, and systems for healthier life on Earth with
human beings as a custodial species for nature?In the battle of distraction versus relation, how can we balance the ledger and remind humans of
the deep, deep, genetic, relational intelligence inside of us? How can we remind us all of the
promise and potential of the internet for equality and justice, for rewiring the network to reverse
the inherited patterns of the empires - that were designed to exclude.
The challenge to overcome is distraction, by design, that networks power into the hands of the
few.
D

The solution is understanding that we have power, ourselves. We have the choice to choose
from many behaviours. We can reshape patterns; imagine new realities; we can tread them; we
can change the network because we are the network! And we know this because, at AIME,
we’ve done it in a small-big way.
Eighteen years ago, AIME designed an anti-networking model of human connections between
those inside and outside the margins, using unlikely connections to build a fairer world. We’ve
been running this model ever since, and are now in the process of building this physical network
into an alternative, digital network - a relational network, unlike a social network.
Hoodie Economics
How do we build a relational network that values us all and is grounded in deep, human
knowledge which connects us back to nature?
AL
W
AY
S
A place where designers have real lived experience working in and out of connections and
relations with all sorts of human and non-human beings.
Where a network is built around lived experience in the real world, before people enter the
infinite possibilities of the internet and what can unfold.
The economy, in the world of AIME, is a relational economy - it’s based deeply on healthy
Indigenous patterns of relations, where you give and don’t expect anything in return and you
know it’s not a waste of time. It's a give-give.
Our relations map to the rivers, to the sky, to each other. They map back in time. They map
across borders, across seas. We trade as needed. We share our knowledge freely and widely.
As we deepen our exchanges of time, knowledge and opportunities, we build an ongoing
mentoring continuum of human progress where the knowledge branch is passed on, time after
time, always learning, always growing. This is the gift being life. [Yolande’s edit] - In Jack’s
language, the language of the Bundjalung Nation, it is the Jalgnay - where the reflection of the fire is
shared with each other in this time and the next. It’s our job to hold the fire. and in Jack's language
of the Bundjalung Nation, the Jalgnay, where the reflection of the fire is shared with each other in this
time and the next.The centre of our economy isn’t a coin. It’s a Hoodie ... a sweatshirt ... a common thread.

The Hoodie is a symbol of rebellion, for the outsider and outcast. With this hoodie, we are
throwing our hand out to those who wear hoodies and those who don’t, to those who think about
economics and those who don’t realise that we are all economists, studying value,
understanding history and future, dancing through temporal shape shifting to make decisions
day in, day out, that are moral decisions, economic decisions, decisions about life.
The challenge we were facing was a network that had been patterned to enhance our
separation, Indigenous vs. non-Indigenous, or the divides across the 190+ nations, states and
provinces within the nations, postcodes and street names, black skin white skin, which shoe
style you wore, which music you listened to, haircuts, algebra levels, digestive habits, sentence
structure, facial dexterity.
When we built AIME as a mentoring model in 2005, we started to notice that when we had
unlikely connections x 2 (a mentor and a mentee from 2 very different walks of life), the focus of
the narrative and relation was enhancing the differences, remarking at the ways of life, of being,
of what we looked like that were different and unique in our different places and spaces. Even
when we found common ground, both parties would leave the table changed for the moment
and yet we would revert back to the established patterns of being a little while after we walked
away from that interaction.
AL
W
AY
S
As we explored the relational patterns, we found that once we reached Unlikely Connections x 5
(UNCx5), there was a stickiness to the shape that created lasting change. There was a circular
energy that would unfold with five, and if someone dropped out (which highlighted a level of
dependency in the UNCx2 model), the other four would find a way to keep generating the
energy and connections. At UNCx5, the network unravelled the patterns of specialisation and
race and culture, and fixed mindsets evaporated. The space in between became human kind,
and we found the deep commonalities like our imagination as a species, our ability to laugh, our
relationships with nature, and our feelings of love.
Research showed that the number 5 was ideal for team size or the ideal amount of friends one
can have. Our work added a design element into who were the 5 and how we created a
generative capacity to the relations. We would make the biggest possible unlikely connections
leap to the next person until we found our 5.
As we looked down at our hand and saw the 5 digits we thought, yeah that’s about right, unlikely
connections x 5 (UNCx5). To re-pattern the network, we had to find our unlikely 5, and then to
Robin Dunbar’s map, we had to multiply the pattern in sets of 5.
And thus, we had an algorithm on our hands for our network design. It was a regenerative
network in flow, moving knowledge inside and outside the margins, in relation.D

Knowledge/History
AL
W
AY
S
We have one long history, a birth from a star, and a natural world beyond anything we as a
species can fathom into language.
What rich human life could exist if we had another 60,000 years on Earth?
If we can rebalance, in this moment in time with our climate emergency, there is no reason why
we can’t emerge in deeper relation with a plan for life on Earth for another 60,000+. We are so
excited to think about what the Indigenous Australian story would be 60,000+ years from now.
The 200 year odd modern Australian history as an example of an anomaly in the lack of valuing
of Indigenous knowledge systems and intelligence across a 120,000 years of life. A blip of a
time we weren’t in balance.
Our oldest Indigenous systems give us the largest intelligence for activating our patterns for how
to live with, from and around nature.
Nature is our anchor.
We are one species.
We are many species.Nature is our shared home.
It’s where we come from and where we end up: in the Earth.
D
R
AF

N
G
As we look ahead to the next 6 billion years of Earth’s existence, before the sun munches it up,
can we imagine human life still here? Can we find a way to imagine a billion years from now
how this time sparked the songlines for the next billion years, in relation to the intelligence of
everything that has been, embracing emergence, to release our control, and find our place in
this ongoing energy dance.
This is the most important decade in human history - we gotta change the way the world works
or there just won’t be human life on Earth - so we’re throwing our hat in the ring to go all in with
all of you for the next 10 years - then stardust this thing and let the magic sing now and forever.
Therefore, we have an intentional death plan for AIME in 10 years’ time, to allow us to build the
healthiest network pattern that can be freely shared with the rest of humanity and then to leave
the stage, allowing regeneration to take its course.
Sure there are challenges ahead, and also, there are opportunities. In modern history, have we
ever seen such a mass transformation of the way teachers engage with students? Have we
ever seen parents so engaged in their children’s education? Have we ever seen students have
such power by having greater knowledge and understanding than almost anyone else of the
“classroom” in which they are being taught? Have we ever seen a greater en masse arrival of
trusted guides on the internet?
AL
W
AY
S
Every sleep leads us to being awake - refreshed. Every ending is a beginning.
We see the urgency of organisations knowing we won’t be around forever having a few powerful
energetic reactions.
Schools wanting to learn from us so teachers can take on the tools.
Our value being connected with.
Hoodies becoming collector items.
Our influence rising as we claim our small time in the spotlight.
Building a bridge and space and sphere of influence, that others can then follow onto after we
are gone.
Talent from across the globe wanting to work with us.
Our team wanting to drive towards a finish line.50 years worth of progress being possible in 10.
The university filling up because there will only ever be 10 years.
The NATION becoming a must visit because the show won’t roll on forever.
AIME being of a time and place in history, a generational movement.

Those that might be wondering about our deep down intentions, suddenly realise we are not in
this for AIME’s power, but for everyone else in the ecosystem. We are the star that is flying
ahead, at forces not yet reached, to then explode to the benefit of us all.
The prize of the next century will be those who defied the pressure to take it all, to design for us
all, history, and life, will reward them. Let’s use this moment to rebuild from the disaster with
united, imaginative, alive, emergent, regenerative, estates.

Network - 52 Countries
In 2004, AIME founder Jack Manning Bancroft sketched an idea of a relational network for
good, one that connected university students as mentors with Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander high school students in Australia. Over the next decade, AIME scaled at pace around
Australia, engaging over 25,000 Indigenous high school students who closed a 40% educationoutcome gap, whilst simultaneously building the largest volunteer movement of University
students in Australia.

As AIME grew throughout Australia, we realised the largest challenge to inequity was not limited
by national borders: it was all interlinked — internationally. In 2016, we expanded our work
around the globe: launching our own TV network, radio show, apparel line, and University to
train people to make unlikely connections and uphold thinking outside the margins. By 2021, our
relational network for good spanned 52 countries, and through healthy patterns of sharing
knowledge, we were drawing intelligence from all these disparate sources to power the future
network.
We are in the process of bringing all of this work into a digital world where we can model a new
economy of exchange where everyone is included and where bridges are built between those in
power and those outside the margins. We’re calling our new nation the IMAGI-NATION: a digital
country where everyone has a seat at the table to help build a fairer world.
After almost 20 years on trying to solve the challenges of inequity, which started for us in
Australia, and has since expanded to over 52 countries, we have been peeling back the band
aid of societal design desperately searching for models that can get us unstuck, and in
movement towards a world where each human being is valued equally.

IMAGI-NATION is already a complex ecosystem - a new nation, where everyone is welcome,
and that's what we've been building over the last 6 years, globally, as we've grown our network
to 52 countries around the world, from where we’ve sourced our knowledge and network
patterns, in addition to the 60,000+ years of Indigenous genius and the millions of years of
natural intelligence that are the primary driving forces.
We have an imaginative capacity to think with complexity before we even commence social
interventions. We work to find the biggest possible lens of the world to have a chance to design
richly. This was hammered home to us by Dr Jane Goodall in 2021 who said to Professor Hope
in her Imagination lecture as the opening keynote for AIME's IMAGI-NATION{University} -
"every action has a huge number of unintended reactions".

QUESTIONS // ABOUT CLASSROOMS
Is there a demographic of kids we are working with?
Why do we teach students in a room?
Where do they learn best?
What environments support different learning styles?
Who teaches who?
Who determines what gets taught?
Why?
When do students get the opportunity to use their imagination?
Is Imagination important?
Does it matter at all ages?
What about nature?
Do students value their connection with nature?
Do they have a connection to nature?Imagination is misunderstood and often neglected in the education system. It is associated with
young children playing rather than being vital to knowledge and learning, and the mother of all -
invention and innovation.
Generally speaking, we tend to have a clear idea of what we think imagination is. We tend to
associate it with the creative arts, business innovation (think Steve Jobs, Einstein, Picasso) or
high end sciences; meaning it’s often misunderstood and under-appreciated in its role in
everyday thinking and in disciplinary and professional practices, and in education.

Imagine what would be possible if we give students in the classroom the freedom to learn in
alternative ways through imagination. If we didn’t close off their thinking, we didn’t put them into
boxes and we encouraged them to think big - bigger than ever before - to design systems and
solutions to our current problems.
Imagine if we told them they had to design our future, our education systems, our policies and
the economy. Imagine if we lifted them up and cheered them on through every adversity, failure
and triumph.
The reality is, teachers are overworked, underutilised and rarely appreciated. They are expected
to achieve certain learning benchmarks, to follow the curriculum and lesson plans and more
than often, they lack the time and or flexibility to work in areas that can promote creative
learning or imaginative learning in their classrooms. In a TED talk on creativity and schooling,
Sir Ken Robinson said that “humans are born with creativity, but we get educated out of it”.

Teaching imaginative thinking can yield many benefits, including sharpening creative skills and
improving social and emotional skills. Incorporating imaginative thinking in classrooms can
activate dormant imaginations.
And now, more than ever, we need people to;
Teach for imagination
Teach with imagination
And, learn with imagination...D

And that sweet little grey spot in the middle, is an Imagination Classroom in every school.
An imagination classroom is a blank page, designed in a way in which going forward requires
imagination. So disorganised, that design is the only thing to create organised chaos. It should
be flexible enough to allow the students to use their imagination. Before imagination is
mentioned, there should be an opportunity for students to use their imaginations. Maybe even
new or uncommon obstacles or barriers should be introduced. Not to prevent or limit access but
to inspire creativity and problem solving.

Considering that most solutions are a click away, the classroom should also be a phone-free
zone. The ability to access solutions easily has prevented us from using our imagination, and
that's because someone has already imagined for us. Sometimes the only resources one should
have is our presence and our thoughts.
Would it be taking it too far to say an imagination classroom should be no four-walled classroom
but the entire universe?
What environment would you like to learn in?
What gets your imagination activated?
An IMAGI-NATION{Embassy} simply reclaims time and space for human beings to imagine.
NASA conducted a famous study on the creative genius of humans, measuring how imaginative
we remain over the years as we become “educated”. What is the role of divergent thinking in
preserving and nourishing one of the most important skills for us: imagination?
The test results were shocking: 98% of 5-year-old children fell into the “genius category of
imagination”, this number dropped to 12% for 15-year-olds and to 2% for adults. All of us knowD

that we are still sending children to schools and tuitions to make them ready for jobs, train them
to test, and get admissions into colleges. What we don’t realise is that, in the process, all of us,
and now our children, are losing their most natural and precious skills, which will become
increasingly critical in this coming age of AI.
Now, more than ever, we need the time and space to reclaim our imaginations. Which is why we
are building 10,000 IMAGI-NATION Embassies over the next 10 years - in schools, workplaces,
communal spaces, and more.

Imagination Boardrooms
For decades, corporations have used Research and Development labs to spur innovation and
create frameworks that enhance the creativity within their organisations. These R&D labs have
traditionally been limited and secretive until the best ideas are ready to be introduced. Within the
JOY Corps model at AIME, we offer an idea to bring everyone within an organisation into a R&D
lab to not only generate ideas that are profitable but to first centre respecting nature and
incorporating the wisdoms of Indigenous systems thinking. An example of what this in-office
R&D lab would look like is called an Imagi-Nation Board room. What is it exactly? I’m glad you
asked - it’s a magical room where executives gather to make important decisions. This isn't just
any ordinary room, though. It was called the Imagination Board Room, because it is filled with all
sorts of sensory enhancing elements that boost creativity and open-mindedness.
The walls of the room are covered in colourful murals of forests, oceans, and mountains which
are indigenous to the land in which the boardroom is built upon. The murals even include
pictures of animals like bears, eagles, and whales. It is like stepping into a world of nature, after
all we’re shifting our mindsets within the boardroom to centre nature in our thought processes
and decision making.In the centre of the room, there is a big table that is covered in yarn. It has all different colours,
and it crisscrosses in every direction. It looks like a big, tangled web, it’s symbolic of embracing
complexity and having free flowing conversations.
Whenever executives need to make an important decision, they come into the Imagination
Board Room and sit around the table. They still utilise their traditional way of working by looking
at data points and information that they have gathered, but they now use their imaginations to
come up with new ideas instead of shooting down ideas.
D
R
AF
TI
N
G
In the imagination boardroom, the executives are encouraged to use their creativity and explore
unlikely connections. They use yarn to connect ideas and concepts that they wouldn't have
thought of before. It’s like a giant brainstorming session, where everyone is free to share their
ideas and opinions. Executives are encouraged to bring in students, citizens, and teachers into
the conversation to advance research and development for their organisations. They tap into the
network of unlikely connections with the Nation powered by AIME.
In each boardroom there is a section called the Imagination Library. This is a program that helps
executives strengthen their imaginations by providing them with books that spark their creativity.
The executives realise that by nurturing adult imaginations, they can help create a future where
people are more connected to nature and make decisions that are better for the planet and their
businesses.
AL
W
AY
S
The executives explore many concepts that support and respect the planet. They talk about
using renewable energy sources, reducing waste, protecting wildlife, and how modern
technology can be a catalyst to solve irreversible climate threats. They also explore ways to
build internal systems of complexity that would help them make better decisions.
An outcome of the imagination board room is that executives realise that they need to change
the way they make decisions and bring R&D out of secretive labs and into a space where
unlikely connections and nature are a part of the conversations about how businesses operate.
Imagination Bus Stops
https://www.betterblock.org/
Imagination boardrooms are just one aspect of the model. There are also imagination bus stops
where citizens gather and yarn on solutions for a fairer and more joyful world. An example of the
Imagination Bus Stop is a community R&D model. The Imagination Bus Stop is a place where
people from all over the world gather to talk about how they can make the world a better place.
There are lots of trees and flowers around the bus stop, and there are even some friendly
animals like birds and squirrels that come to visit. The people who come to the bus stop are
people who have been shaped by various life experiences and are curious about imagination,
kindness and values-driven lifestyles.When people arrive at the bus stop, they get split into groups of five. These groups are called
"unlikely connections x5" because they're made up of people who might not normally be friends,
but they work together to come up with ideas for how to make the world a better place.
D
R
AF
TI
N
G
There's this really fun puppet named Professor AIME who drives the imagination bus, and he
takes the groups of five to a magical place called the Imagination. In the Imagination, anything is
possible, this includes solving the most challenging problems of current times! While there isn’t
a physical bus, we envision people walking to parks, hiking, going into cafes, or community
centered spaces to activate the community R&D labs. The Imagination Bus Stops are marked
similar to a traditional bus stop so that people can easily identify the gathering space. The
people in the groups can imagine all sorts of cool things that they can do to make the world a
better place.
They might imagine planting more trees, or building sustainable houses for people who don't
have them. They might imagine making sure that everyone has enough food to eat that’s grown
sustainably, or helping to take care of animals that are hurt or sick. And they do all of this with
joy and kindness, because they know that it's important to be respectful to nature, animals, and
other people. The Imagination Bus Stops don’t require a huge capital investment, rather a
simple sign that can be made from recycled materials and inked with paint to signify the
gathering spot. This model is scalable even in remote areas of the world.
Embassies at Festivals = A pop-up Imagination R&D Lab
AL
W
AY
S
The embassies and festivals have a unique R&D lab playground. Imagination Embassies - a
pop-up style experience that brings together VIKP guests to create unlikely connections and
provide input to AIME's 20+ projects while immersing in nature.
●
Step 1: Choose a location
The first step is to choose a location that is in close proximity to nature within the festival
grounds. A park, beach or forest can be an ideal location. Ensure that the location can
accommodate a lab that can host groups of five guests at a time and has access to electricity
tablets, tvs, whiteboards, and phone charging stations.
●
Step 2: Design the Imagination Embassy
Design the Imagination Embassy in a way that it represents nature and the vibe of the festival
and have a pull down wall of AIME’s 20+ projects that guests will provide input for. The embassy
should have various sections that represent different elements of nature such as earth, water,
air and fire. The sections should be designed in a way that guests can immerse themselves in
nature while providing feedback. To encourage connections, phones are stored in lockers that
recharge the phone so it’s a benefit to the crew charging their phones and encouraging them to
immerse themselves in nature for this experience.●
Step 3: Create Unlikely Connections of 5 (UNCX5)
The core element of the Imagination Embassy is the Unlikely Connections X 5. When guests
arrive at the embassy, they will be assigned to a lab where they will meet four other guests.
Each lab should have a unique theme or challenge related to nature. The guests will then
participate in a yarn - a conversation that encourages sharing and collaboration. This is where
the unlikely connections are formed and guests can brainstorm input to AIME's 20 projects.
Step 4: Incorporate Nature
D
R

●
Nature is an integral part of the Imagination Embassy festival experience. Ensure that the
embassy is surrounded by nature and incorporate natural elements into the design. Host
activities such as nature walks, bird watching and stargazing to encourage guests to immerse
themselves in nature.
●
Step 5: Provide Opportunities for Engagement
Guests should have the opportunity to provide input on AIME's 20 projects. Encourage guests to
submit names of their network who may be able to help the projects advance to the next phase.
They can also sign their company up to bring an Imagination Board Room to life in their office.
This will help AIME to gain new insights and connect with potential collaborators.
AL

AY
S
In summary, Imagination Embassies are a unique way to bring together VIKP guests to create
unlikely connections, provide input to AIME's 20 projects and immerse themselves in nature. By
following these five steps, we can scale an unforgettable experience that will leave guests
feeling inspired and connected.
Imagination Embassies for Everyone
The natural world offers us a wealth of inspiration for creating a sustainable and collaborative
society. With this in mind, we can use the power of nature as a model for creating an
Imagination Embassy, a pop-up research and development lab for citizens of the world to come
together and discuss social issues with a focus on respecting planet Earth.
●Initial Step: We outline UNCX5 as a requirement for Imagination Embassies for
Everyone. We identify five individuals from different backgrounds who are curious about
solutions that make positive changes for the environment. These individuals could come
from different ages, genres, and professions such as artists, scientists, engineers,
educators, and community leaders. By bringing together a diverse group of people, we
can tap into their unique perspectives, skills, and experiences to generate innovative
ideas.
●Second Step: Leverage the concept of biomimicry, which is the practice of imitating
nature's processes and systems to solve human problems. Explore ways to incorporate
this approach to design an Imagination Embassy that is sustainable, efficient, andcost-effective or meet within a natural space such as a local park or beach. Thinking
about tapping into nature, we can use materials that are biodegradable or recycled,
incorporate natural lighting and ventilation, and use renewable energy sources such as
solar power. Meeting through video chat is also a reliable and cost efficient way to
connect.
Creative Activation of Sponsors: To ensure that this initiative does not require any
monetary investment, we can rely on the power of collaboration and sponsorship. Global
citizens and organisations can sponsor the Imagination Embassy, providing funding and
resources for the next ten years. This would enable groups to gather on a consistent
schedule, with workshops and events supporting participants as they come together to
exchange ideas, learn from one another, and develop solutions for social issues that
impact the environment.
●Invitation to Apply to be a Fellow: Citizens can enter a fellowship within Imagination
University, powered by AIME. This program would provide participants with the tools,
resources, and support they need to transform their ideas into action. They would have
access to mentorship, training, and funding opportunities to help them launch their own
projects and initiatives.

can inspire a new generation of global citizens who are committed to respecting planet Earth
and creating a brighter future for all.
A safe place to imagine. Let’s open source it and share our case studies together.
AIME will create 5 moving Embassies to help provide examples, and help create Imagination
Classrooms in schools around the world.

IMPACT
The R&D framework called Imagination R&D labs powered by AIME, utilises 60,000 years of
continuous knowledge to centre nature and Indigenous systems thinking for innovation in
corporate spaces. It has several potential economic impacts for organisations that adopt it.
R&D is a key aspect of corporate innovation. It helps companies to dream up new knowledge,
create innovative products and services, and improve existing ones. R&D labs play a critical role
in supporting corporate innovation, as they provide a dedicated space and resources for
conducting research and development activities. This section aims to examine the economic
impact of R&D labs in corporate innovation, including the sources of data used to support this
analysis.
Firstly, the framework leads to the development of more innovative and sustainable products
and services with a respect of nature first model. By tapping into the knowledge and wisdom of
Indigenous cultures and nature-based approaches, organisations can gain unique insights and
perspectives that can inspire novel ideas and solutions. Going beyond the intersection of DEI
and Sustainability. This can give organisations a competitive edge in the marketplace, attract
new customers, and drive revenue.
AL
W
AY
S
Secondly, adopting the Imagination R&D labs framework, powered by AIME, can support
organisations to reduce their environmental impact and cultivate a ripple effect of sustainability
throughout the ecosystem of supply chains. By incorporating principles of nature-based design
and Indigenous knowledge, organisations can develop more environmentally-friendly practices
and products that appeal to consumers who are increasingly solution driven towards
sustainability practices.
Thirdly, by incorporating diverse perspectives and knowledge into their innovation processes,
organisations can improve their ability to solve complex problems and adapt to changing
circumstances. This can increase organisational resilience and agility, which are important
factors in today's rapidly changing business environment.
Metrics
Traditionally R&D metrics are determined through several markers including financial
statements, which provide information on a company's R&D spending, sales growth, profit
margins, and market value. Another source of data is patent data, which traditionally has been
used to measure a company's innovation output and the impact of its R&D activities on the
industry (Harhoff et al., 1999). Additionally, surveys of R&D labs can provide insights into the
types of activities conducted in these labs and their impact on innovation and economic growth
(National Science Foundation, 2017).Overall, the adoption of the Imagination powered by AIME framework has the potential to
provide organisations with a competitive advantage, improve their sustainability practices, and
increase their ability to adapt to changing circumstances, all of which can have positive
economic impacts.

The big prize of unleashing an imagination lab for humanity is to shift the world at large by
returning humans to our custodial role in nature and reclaiming space for humanity to
collectively use our intelligence, in relation with all the other species, to solve the challenges of
today and tomorrow. Some lenses that organisations traditionally apply at R&D labs are
presented below but the macro systems view of building a fairer world all together is what drives
us.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) LABS
Research and Development (R&D) labs are an integral component of corporate innovation.
These labs are designed to create and develop new products, processes, and technologies that
can help companies stay competitive in the market. The economic impact of R&D labs is
significant, as it can lead to improved productivity, increased sales and job creation. In this
section, we will explore the economic impact of R&D labs in corporate innovation, including
sources of data that support why R&D receives billions in annual investments from both the
public and private sectors.
AL
W
AY
S
Productivity Improvement:
R&D labs significantly improve the performance of a company. By investing in R&D labs,
companies develop new technologies and processes that streamline their production process,
reduce costs, and increase efficiency. According to a study by the National Bureau of Economic
Research, R&D investments can lead to a 5-10% increase in productivity for firms in the
manufacturing industry (Griliches, 1992). Moreover, a report by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that R&D investments can improve productivity
growth by up to 0.4% annually (OECD, 2015).
Value Add of Imagination R&D Labs powered by AIME
Organisations have a unique opportunity to move beyond diversity, equity, and inclusion to
integrating intelligence from outside the margins into innovation frameworks within the realm of
R&D. Companies are familiar with the upside of engaging in external R&D partnerships which
can bring several economic benefits to an organisation. Here are some of them:
●
Access to expertise: External R&D partnerships allow organisations to access
specialised expertise and more specifically, intelligence from outside the margins that
they may not have in-house. This can help organisations to develop new products orimprove existing ones, which can increase their market share and generate higher
revenues.
Reduced costs: R&D partnerships can be costly, but collaborating with external
partners can reduce costs associated with research and development. This can be
achieved through cost-sharing, knowledge sharing, and shared resources. By partnering
with AIME corporations can begin to centre 60,000+ of intelligence network.
●Faster time to market: Working with external partners can help organisations to speed
up their R&D process, which can reduce the time to market for new products. This can
give organisations a competitive advantage and generate higher profits with a
sustainability, first mover advantage.
●Mitigate risk: R&D partnerships can also help organisations to mitigate risk associated
with product development. Collaborating with external partners can reduce the risk of
failure, as partners can bring additional knowledge and resources to the table.
●Access to new markets: R&D partnerships can also provide organisations with access
to new markets. By collaborating with partners from different regions, organisations can
gain a better understanding of local markets and develop products that are tailored to
specific market needs.

W
AY
S
Overall, engaging in external R&D partnerships can help organisations to improve their
innovation capabilities, reduce costs, mitigate risk, and gain access to new markets, which can
result in higher revenues and profits.
Sales Growth:
Investments in R&D labs also lead to increased sales for companies. The development of new
and innovative products help companies capture new markets and expand their customer base.
A study by the European Patent Office found that companies that invest in R&D have higher
sales growth rates than companies that do not invest in R&D (European Patent Office, 2013).
Furthermore, a report by the US Department of Commerce found that companies that invest in
R&D have higher rates of export growth than companies that do not invest in R&D (US
Department of Commerce, 2018).
Job Creation:
Investments in R&D labs also lead to job creation. By developing new technologies and
products, companies create new job opportunities in areas such as engineering, research and
development. A study by the National Science Foundation found that every $1 million in R&D
spending generates approximately 19 jobs (National Science Foundation, 2018). Moreover, a
report by the US Department of Commerce found that R&D-intensive industries have a higher
job multiplier than non-R&D-intensive industries (US Department of Commerce, 2018).Summary:
In Summary, R&D labs are a crucial component of corporate innovation, and their economic
impact is significant. Investments in R&D labs can lead to improved productivity, increased sales
and job creation. The sources of data mentioned in this article support the claim that R&D labs
can have a positive economic impact on companies. Therefore, companies invest in R&D labs
to stay competitive in the market and achieve long-term growth.

IMPACT
R&D activities play a crucial role in promoting economic growth and enhancing the
competitiveness of firms and industries. R&D activities involve the creation of new knowledge,
ideas, and technologies that can lead to innovative products, processes, and services, which in
turn can generate higher profits, increase market share, and create new job opportunities.
There is a large body of literature that has examined the economic impact of R&D. A study by
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that R&D
investment is positively associated with higher levels of productivity, economic growth and job
creation across countries (OECD, 2019). Another study by the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER) found that R&D activities can increase firm-level productivity and profitability
by enabling firms to introduce new products and improve existing ones (Griliches, 1992).
AL
W
AY
S
In addition, R&D activities can also have spillover effects, which means that the knowledge and
technologies developed by one firm or industry can be used by others, leading to further
innovation and economic growth. A study by the European Commission found that R&D
spillovers can lead to a significant increase in economic growth, productivity, and
competitiveness at the national level (European Commission, 2017).
Furthermore, R&D activities can also have important implications for environmental
sustainability and social welfare. For example, R&D investments in clean energy technologies
can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a transition to a low-carbon economy, while
R&D investments in healthcare technologies can improve health outcomes and reduce
healthcare costs (Popp, 2019).
In summary, the economic impact of R&D is significant and multifaceted, with positive effects on
productivity, economic growth, job creation, and social welfare. Governments, firms, and other
stakeholders can benefit from investing in R&D activities to promote innovation and
competitiveness in the global economy.

MENTOR TRAINING
SYNOPSIS
Mentors invest in relations, they create environments for knowledge to flow between groups of
people while looking out on the world to gain new perspectives in relation.D
R
AF
TI
N
G
It’s how knowledge is kept regenerative and fluid - each one of us holding a fragmented piece to
the picture and remembering we are not the only ones who hold perspectives - trees, water, the
stars, fire and every living thing in the universe holds its own perspectives as well as those they
are in relation too. It’s a complex, beautiful, self organising system that will turn your brain into
mush if you don’t stay in relation - Mentors build relations.
I go to the biggest possible view first because every action has intended and unintended
consequences and seeing from all these different perspectives help to reveal some of the
hidden opportunities that are deep within the layers of systems. We’re not taught to think in this
way in our institutions, it’s mostly read and recite and be graded, or knowledge out of relation
and very linear, limited, boxed in, trapped, suffocating ways of thinking. Mentors make space for
freedom from this way of learning.
AL
W
AY
S
The world keeps moving and is in a constant state of becoming every single second, and for the
most part we’re disconnected from this, with knowledge out of relation, that steers us towards a
lifestyle where cash is king. But in reality, it’s not - nature is, always was and always will be.
Mentors build environments that allow the nodes in the network to become reconnected - we
can plug back in and build a systems thinking mindset that is in relation along the way. Using the
18 values helps us build these environments for felt learning experiences to spark the
reconnections. Once the spark is there, together we/us/all can flow under, around, over and
through the barriers in the current system and surf all the layers in between to connect and
make systems healthier, as we pass through.

NY Judges Project
The New York Governor's Office and CUNY Law School have recognized the need for systems
change in the way that youth from the Bronx and Queens boroughs of New York City engagewith law professionals. To achieve this goal, they are partnering with AIME, to provide training
on how to become mentors to judges, justices, clerks, lawyers, and adjacent legal professionals.

2023 is the first year of the three-year project which aims to reshape the way that young people
interact with judges and judicial staff across the state of New York. AIME's 20-year knowledge in
mentoring, combined with their 18 established values, is seen as essential in unlocking the
potential of these legal professionals and the unlikely connections of young people and
providing them with the tools they need to engage in a highway of mentoring which will be
delivered in a virtual format.
Judges and judicial staff across the state recognize the value of AIME's 18 established values,
which emphasise things like asking questions, respect, and failure time. By focusing on the full
set of values, they believe that they can create a more positive and supportive environment,
which will ultimately lead to better outcomes in establishing unlikely connections.
The project is expected to have a significant impact on the way that young people in the Bronx
and Queens engage with law professionals. By providing them with mentors not saviours and
guidance, it is hoped that they will be better able to understand, and be a part of, new systems
and frameworks of legal systems now and in the future. Ultimately, the goal is to create a more
just and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to live in harmony with nature
and one another.

A world of 1 Billion Trained Mentors
Imagine a world with 1 billion mentors who are trained to lead life through values. The culture of
the society would be shaped by the fundamental principles of honesty, respect, compassion,
and responsibility. These mentors would be well-versed in the art of listening, asking questions,
and empathising with others. They would understand that every individual is unique, with their
own set of experiences, beliefs and perspectives.
In this world, life as we currently experience the season of planet Earth we move from a system
where a few people are in power and make decisions to a world where there would be no
saviours or self-righteous individuals. Everyone would understand that they are part of a larger
network of human connections, and that their actions impact not just themselves, but others and
the planet as well. By valuing and prioritising relationships, individuals would be able to take a
step back from letting emails and text messages dictate their actions, to working towards a
common goal, creating a harmonious and sustainable society.
The emphasis on values and ethics would also translate into the workplace, where individuals
would be encouraged to be brave and discuss their work ethic which includes spending time in
nature to recharge and maintain an optimal state of well-being. This would help to foster mutualrespect and understanding between colleagues, and create an environment where everyone's
contributions are valued and appreciated.
In a world where being rebellious is seen as a positive trait, individuals would be encouraged to
challenge the status quo, to question the norm, and to think outside the box. This would help to
foster innovation and creativity, and create a culture where new ideas and perspectives are
welcomed and valued.

60,000+ years of intelligence, we are able to highlight and share a framework of mentorship
through training and development to corporations worldwide. Mentorship has been shown to
have a positive impact on both mentors and mentees, and research in this area continues to
grow. In this section, we share a few data points and research on the impact of mentorship,
including available impact metrics:
Improved career outcomes: Mentorship has been shown to positively impact career
outcomes such as job satisfaction, salary, and promotions. In a study of 1,000
employees by LinkedIn, 94% of respondents said that mentorship was effective in
helping them achieve their goals, and 89% said they would be interested in being a
mentor themselves. (Source: LinkedIn, "The Mentorship Effect")

Increased confidence and self-efficacy: Mentees who receive mentorship often report
increased confidence and self-efficacy, which can have a positive impact on their career
and personal life. In a study of STEM students, those who received mentorship reported
higher levels of self-efficacy and were more likely to persist in their chosen field.
Enhanced learning and development: Mentorship can also contribute to the learning
and development of both mentors and mentees. In a study of medical students, those
who participated in a mentorship program reported higher levels of knowledge
acquisition and improved clinical skills. (Source: BMC Medical Education, "Mentoring in
Medical Education: A Systematic Review")
Improved mental health and well-being: Mentorship can provide emotional support
and guidance to mentees, which can lead to improved mental health and well-being. In a
study of at-risk youth, those who received mentorship reported lower levels of
depression and anxiety. (Source: Journal of Primary Prevention, "Mentoring and At-Risk
Youths' Academic and Emotional Development: A Quasi-Experimental Study")Overall, the data and research on the impact of mentorship suggests that it can have positive
effects on both mentors and mentees, contributing to career success, personal development,
and well-being.
Scalability: The mentor app developed by AIME has the potential to scale quickly and
reach a large audience with AIME’s 18 values as a driver for the mentor training, which
is the core component of the app. The app will remove barriers for individuals to become
mentors, and will allow mentees to connect with mentors from anywhere in the world that
have a values-based approach, which includes being a mentor not a saviour. This
radical framework of training mentors on values isn’t the first of its kind, but it is the most
tested across 52 countries and is prime to scale to train 1 billion mentors worldwide in
collaboration with Go1. As the app grows in popularity, it will become a valuable tool for
individuals and organisations looking to develop mentorship programs.
●Accessibility: The mentor app will make mentorship training more accessible to
individuals who may not have had access to mentorship training in the past. This
includes individuals who live in remote regions, individuals with disabilities, and
individuals who may not have had access to qualified mentors in their field of interest. By
increasing accessibility, the app has the potential to level the playing field and provide
opportunities for individuals who may have otherwise not been able to access unlikely
connections.
●Impact: The mentor app has the potential to have a significant impact on the quality of
time spent by individuals and organisations. By providing individuals with access to
qualified mentor training, the app can help to increase relations between humans,
nature, academic and career success, reduce turnover rates, and increase engagement.
The app has the potential to be a valuable tool for organisations looking to develop and
retain talent.

SYNOPSIS
As kids, we are tested on our ability to efficiently recount the histories that got us to this point,
and master the fundamentals of information retention. Success in school is often defined by our
ability to simply read back information that we were taught, with no room for questioning the
creation and maintenance of the systems that create the big problems our world is facing today.
The voices and intelligence of those outside the margins has been actively thwarted in our
education systems. Imagination - our most critical skill in these rapidly evolving times - is killed
in the classroom (see NASA study above, or listen to Ken Robinson unpack this in his famous
TED talk).
It’s time we recognize that people have been physically and systemically pushed outside the
margin. The conversations on global representation are a product of the lines drawn four
hundred years ago and the removal of Indigenous knowledge from the dominant narratives that
persist. So the answer is not to just recreate or rebuild within, but position the imaginations of
those on the margins at the forefront of the new narratives needed to reshape the world.
There is a shift going in the world right now. Global forces are attempting to make a pivot
towards understanding how to make equitable solutions; at AIME we've been working for 18
years generating measurable changes using a framework for reigniting the imagination.We need to work on regaining the knowledge lost from those pushed outside the margins. There
are ongoing issues with the maintenance of the margins, but also in excluding the imagination of
Indigenous minds. We need to rebuild the globe and get it to a place where we recognize that
we must look outside to solve within. Millions of people and minds have left behind but the
thinking that the people possess does not solve the issue, the Indigenous thinking that was left
behind will solve the issue.

Imagine a world without borders. Our entire perspective of humanity, politics, and global
exchange would shift. There would be no ideas of immigration, passports would be useless,
politics would not be regional because regions would not exist.
Imagine a world without the missing perspectives and colonial narratives ... a world where four
hundred year old thought processes were put to rest, and a thing of the past.
Imagine a world where Indigenous thinking led the way. Where the curriculum was written by
people from outside the margins, and their stories were told by them and for them.
AIME’s solution: MentorClass{Imagine} - where curriculum, unlikely connections, and
imagination work together as a framework for global change. Where all people are taught to
reimagine the world they want to live in, so that two or three generations from now we are living
in the margins of our own imaginations.

IMPACT
For the last eighteen years AIME has created 150+ interactive mentor classes, and the work of
imagination based practice has closed the educational gap for 25,000 Indigenous high school
students. AIME has also prioritised the training of volunteers to become mentors and the
non-profit has trained over 10,000+ minds, with our network reach now spanning 52+ countries.
The work has fostered unlikely connections across the globe to solve the issues that lead to
educational disengagement for marginalised students. Through mentorship and strategic
creation of educational resources, AIME has increased the graduation rate for graduating school
students from 39% to 75%.
The educational mentorship initiative, focused on addressing education inequality, has taken
steps towards breaking the continuous cycles and repositioning imagination as a lifelong
practice for internal agency. Using Imagination Education Pedagogical Framework (IEPF) as a
vehicle for knowledge production, AIME's work has been crucial in breaking Educational barriers
and instituting change to redefine the margins and make room for Indigenous minds to rewrite
history.AIME's solution: MentorClass – a project 18+ years in the making at AIME. With MentorClass,
the limitless nature of humanity’s most powerful tool, our brains, is embraced. Embracing a
global Imagination is the answer to the global disconnect between those who hold power and
those who do not.
MentorClass is a framework that levels the imagination playing field for everyone.

IMPACT
Fashion research and development (R&D) labs have become increasingly important in the
fashion industry, particularly in relation to sustainability and respecting the planet. This section
provides an outline of the concept of a sustainable and scalable fashion R&D lab and its
financial impacts.
A sustainable and scalable fashion R&D lab powered by reclAIMed inside the Imagination
Factory. The Imagination factory is a facility for teams to collaborate, researching and
developing sustainable solutions for the fashion industry that can be scaled up to meet the
needs of a healthier planet. The lab explores areas of research such as identifying new
materials, production methods, and technologies that can reduce the environmental impact of
the fashion industry while also maintaining profitability. The lab also focuses on ensuring that
any sustainable solutions developed are scalable and can be implemented across the industry.
An early example of R&D collaboration with AIME is the seawood hoodie. Seaweed-based
textiles, also known as "sea leather," are made from kelp, a type of seaweed that is harvestedand processed to create a soft, durable material that can be used to make clothing and
accessories. Unlike traditional textiles like cotton or polyester, which are derived from
non-renewable resources and can take decades or even centuries to decompose,
seaweed-based textiles are biodegradable and can be composted in as little as a few weeks.
Seaweed hoodies are fully compostable because they are made entirely from biodegradable
materials, including the seaweed fibres, the dye used to colour the fabric, and the thread used
to sew the garment together.

ReclAIMEd fashion and fabrics with a nature-first approach prioritise sustainable and ethical
practices, and seek to minimise their environmental impact. The concept of impact is
multifaceted and includes social, economic, and environmental dimensions. In the context of
fashion sustainability, impact can be summarised in four areas:
Environmental Impact: This refers to the impact that fashion has on the natural world. It
encompasses the use of raw materials, the manufacturing process, and the disposal of
clothing. The environmental impact of fashion is significant, with the industry being one
of the largest polluters globally. Sustainable fashion seeks to minimise this impact by
using recycled or organic materials, reducing water usage, and minimising waste.
●Social Impact: The social impact of fashion is concerned with the human aspect of the
industry. This includes the working conditions of factory workers, fair wages, and the
impact on local communities. Sustainable fashion prioritises fair labour practices, and
ethical production methods.
●Economic Impact: The economic impact of fashion refers to its contribution to the
global economy. Sustainable fashion seeks to create a circular economy, where
resources are reused, and waste is minimised. This approach creates new job
opportunities and encourages the growth of sustainable businesses.
●Cultural Impact: The cultural impact of fashion refers to the way clothing and fashion
trends shape society. Sustainable fashion promotes diversity, inclusivity, and a broader
representation of cultures and communities. It seeks to shift the cultural narrative around
fashion towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

An example of a partnership that embraces a nature-first approach in fashion is the AIME and
MJ BALE partnership based out of Australia. AIME is a social enterprise that began as a
mentorship network supporting Indigenous Australian youth and now has global reach in 52
countries as a solutions lab solving the challenges of today’s time including the impact of
fashion waste to the plant. AIME has a well-developed and scalable partnership with MJ BALE,
which is a menswear brand that prioritises sustainability and ethical practices. The partnership
involves the creation of a limited edition collection of suits under the division of AIME known as
reclAIMEd. To further describe the elements of this partnership, selected suits feature unique
designs inspired by Indigenous Australian art, with a portion of the monetary proceeds goingtowards supporting AIME's programs. This partnership demonstrates how sustainable fashion
can be a force for positive change, promoting environmental and social sustainability while
supporting local communities.

Sustainable fashion is an emerging trend in the fashion industry that is gaining significant
attention from consumers and investors alike. The concept of sustainable fashion revolves
around the use of eco-friendly materials, ethical production practices, and reducing the
environmental impact of the fashion industry. In recent years, sustainable fashion has become
an increasingly popular investment opportunity due to the growing awareness of environmental
and social issues. This section of the academic paper will discuss the future of sustainable
fashion and its impact on the economy, with references to relevant sources.
Impact of Sustainable Fashion on the Economy
The fashion industry is one of the largest industries in the world, with an estimated global value
of $2.5 trillion in 2021. The industry is also responsible for significant environmental and social
impacts. According to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the fashion industry is
responsible for over 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes more energy than
the aviation and shipping industries combined. Consumers have traditionally engaged in the
fashion economy without fully understanding the impact on the planet. The industry has recently
come to address old systems that enabled poor labour practices, including low wages, long
hours, and unsafe working conditions.
AL
W
AY
S
As consumers become more aware of these issues, there has been a growing demand for
sustainable fashion and a call for solutions such as what reclAIMEd provides as a scaleable
solution. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, the sustainable fashion market is
expected to grow by 15-20% annually, reaching a market value of $9.81 billion by 2025. This
growth is driven by consumers' increasing demand for eco-friendly and socially responsible
products.
Investment Opportunities in Sustainable Fashion
Investing in sustainable fashion is a profitable venture and the market continues to grow.
Sustainable fashion companies are adopting innovative production methods that reduce waste,
minimize environmental impact, and promote ethical practices. These companies are also
leveraging technology to create sustainable and innovative products that cater to consumers'
evolving need while seeking partners such as AIME which 60,000 years of intelligence of
working with nature, the innovation opportunity for partnerships is attractive for fashion industry
pioneers and trailblazers.
Some of the top sustainable fashion companies that investors can consider include Patagonia,
Everlane, and Stella McCartney. Patagonia is a leading outdoor clothing company that uses
organic cotton and recycled polyester in its products, while also promoting fair labor practices.
Everlane is a direct-to-consumer brand that focuses on transparency and sustainability in itsproduction process. Stella McCartney is a luxury fashion brand that is committed to using
sustainable materials and ethical production practices. These are a few examples of scalable
partnerships that the reclAIMEd framework could support.

SYNOPSIS
When seeking to understand a concept I find that breaking down each word adds a layer of
understanding therefore when we look at the word kindness from its etymological roots it stems
from Proto-Germanic *kundi- " meaning: natural, native from the word *kunjam meaning "family"
kin. Economics on the other hand has changed from its traditional meaning of oikonomia
meaning household management now being defined as the study of how we distribute scarce
resources, goods and welfare amongst society. Simplified we can say it is where we place our
value.
Kindness Economics is an economic system which AIME wants to be a part of placing at the
heart of the global ecosystem, festivals and organisations by shifting where we place our value.
We recognise that the world has been constructed to focus on profit, reward competition and
gain. This approach has coined phrases such as “It’s a dog eat dog world”, “every man for
himself”, “survival of the fittest”and many more, all of these were constructed in a world that
placed greed at its core whilst creating inequality and destroying the planet along with it.
It is not enough to know this, we want to be a part of changing it by creating an ecosystem that
values people and the planet as much as it does profit, this shifts us to kindness which is rooted
in relational economics,when we are kind It allows us to demonstrate empathy and compassion
which connects us to one another and to the planet around us. This heightens our
consciousness and concern for how we choose to trade, whether that be our time or resources.
In the journal of happiness it showed that when people are kind it increases their happiness and
life satisfaction, whilst other studies have shown kindness reduces stress, improves wellbeing,
social cohesion and lowers depression and anxiety. This goes to show that having a kinder
organisation, festival or world is worth investing in.AIME is focused on creating sustainable levers of change, rewarding kindness and starting by
centering it at the heart of 1000 festivals, with 10000 Very Important Kind People
Very Important Kind People Program For Festivals

Globally we have celebrated people due to their influence, power or financial accomplishments
solely, deeming them VIP’s. As the world shifts and we start placing humanity and kindness at
the heart of global systems, AIME has created a new program called VIKP’s This is a Very
Important KIND Person. This is a system designed to reward people who have demonstrated
kindness in their communities and to those around them, by gifting them with entries into
various festivals as VIKP’s and ambassadors of a kinder world.
AIME recognises that the person who is running a weekly food kitchen to support their
community is as valuable as the executive running a company. We want to consistently
recognise people who have embodied kindness in their lives and allow them to pay it forward
through their experiences at the various festivals whilst slowly shifting where society places
value.
When festivals have VIKP’s it:
●
●
AL
W
AY
S
●
Creates a positive and inclusive atmosphere where everyone in attendance feels seen
and valued
Fosters connection: when people know that other kind people are attending the feel safe
to interact and build relationships
Creates a safe environment: since people know that their fellow attendees value
kindness they can feel safe to express themselves holistically
Creates a ripple effect: inherently when people are kind to us we want to be kind to
others
Respects the environment: when people have kindness as a core value they respect
each other and the environment they are in
Creates inclusivity: when people have been shown that value has been placed on their
kindness and not how much money they bought the ticket for it opens them up to feeling
included
Creates a story of impact: for both the participants and the festival
●
●
●

A recent VIKP at the HumanKind Festival where we ran the program said the following to AIME:
“As a transwoman who has been harassed on the train for my identity, I have never felt so
loved, seen and accepted in a public space let alone a festival. Thank you for creating a safe
space for not just me but everyone here”This testimonial amongst many others shows how impactful having kind and compassionate
people present at any festival is. The VIKP model is an alternative model of transaction that
displays a way of trade that is relational and places people at the centre of an economic model.
Shifting the dynamics of the current operational ecosystem to one that is human centric and
built on sustainable values, that nurture oneness and collaboration with each other and the
planet.
The Process of finding VIKP’s:

1. Potential festival goers will be asked to go onto our easy online portal to nominate a kind
person and share how this individual displays acts of kindness in the world
2. AIME will then review the entries
3. Successful applicants that have been chosen will be issued with two tickets to attend the
festival
VIKP is restructuring where we place value in society by integrating a new model that is based
on relations and not simply transactions.
Kindness Economics in Corporate Organisations VIKC’s
Capitalism has placed profit at the centre of society, rewarding a transactional economic model,
however giving organisations an opportunity to relook at the way it functions by creating a
relational dynamic. That puts people at the centre and choosing to use what AIME refers to as
the three sustainable P’s that can be used to measure organisational success.
People
○ Do people feel seen, valued and heard within the organisation?
○ Is kindness,collaboration, compassion and empathy at the core of the
organisation and being rewarded?
○ Is it a respectful and kind work environment?
○ Does leadership within the organisation display understanding and kindness?
Planet
○ Is the organisation aware of its impact on the environment?
○ Are sustainable business practices being used with the organisation?
○ Is there a focus on reducing the impact on the planet, whether that be water
usage, energy consumption or excessive waste
Profit
○ Is the organisation focused on a fair wage policy to allow people to feel valued?
○ Is the company investing in sustainable initiatives that support kindness to their
communities or the planet?
○ Is the company investing in sustainable business practices that focus on
kindness and compassion and not greed?
○ Paying it forward, depending on the organisation, it dedicates 10% of services or
products or profits from them to their community to reward kindness

●The kinder an organisation is has been proven to benefit an organisation’s overall success
because when employees are happy, compassionate and in flow with the organisational culture
they have the ability to access their imagination, empathy and joy which leads to creative
solutions to the companies needs.
●
●
A study published in the Journal of Organisational Behaviour found that when
employees perceived their organisation as having a positive and kind work climate, they
were more likely to engage in proactive behaviours, such as generating new ideas,
being imaginative and seeking out new opportunities for the organisation.
A literary article published in the Journal of Business and Psychology found that social
support and collaboration at work was positively related to creativity, with studies
showing that individuals who felt supported by their colleagues and supervisors were
more likely to engage in creative problem-solving and innovation within their roles.
Studies suggest that when people are treated with kindness and feel valued in their
organisation, they are more likely to be imaginative and productive.

In addition to an organisation having a kinder workforce there are additional benefits to placing a
kindness economy at the centre of the organisation and that includes incorporating a structure
that operates within and outside the organisation which places emphasis on the nature of the
business being rooted in a relational system and not a transactional one.
When a business moves from transactional it’s core essence becomes serving the community it
operates in first and foremost and caring for those it does business with whilst also taking
measures to ensure that it is taking care of the environment in which it operates.

The benefits of moving from a transactional to relational economy are:

This shows the organisation is operating with purpose and dedication to its community.
Increased community support, because when those who interact with the business feel
taken care of they will remain loyal to the organisation
Increased innovation within the organisation, when people feel like they are operating to
fulfil a purpose that is larger than profit they want to continue creating ways to be of
service
VIKC’s are Very Important Kind Companies, that are committed to creating sustainable change
in business by valuing kindness and collaboration over greed and competition.

In the past twenty years AIME has measured the number of university hours in the early years
which from 2010 to 2020 saw 258,137 hours in kind from mentors valued at $60/hr was worth
$14,159,631 worth of mentoring time. This in kind gesture, is relational currency in effect.
As we head towards our intentional death strategy, in the next ten years we have the infinite
opportunity to showcase the power of incorporating the kindness economy model into festivals
and organisations showcasing its efficacy in creating a new and sustainable narrative that
benefits humanity and the planet.
At the HumanKind Festival we awarded 1000 kind people an experience that inspired them to
take what they learned and implement it into their businesses, communities and interpersonal
relationships and one that the festival organisers defined as “revolutionary”.●

By looking at festivals as a ground for change, we create a large enough case study backed
with evidence for organisations to recognise the power of placing kindness at the heart of every
ecosystem. There is a tangible benefit to the festivals, festival goers and the ripple effect this
creates in other areas of society.
If festivals had to reward 15 - 20% of their tickets to kind people, it would create a ripple through
the ecosystem and introduce a new societal measurement. Much like the happiness index has
been adopted.
AIME’s mission is to make every festival a kindness fest, placing a new metric of what defines
an event’s success, recognising compassion and empathy at its core.
In the next 10 years by certifying 100 large festivals a year as official KindFest’s and they award
anywhere between 100 - 250 kindness tickets per event. That would create a measurable
impact of 100000 - 250000 kindness ambassadors.
AL
W
AY
S
These festivals once being certified would be required to pledge to do it for a minimum of three
years to accurately measure the impact it has had on the quality of their festival which means
the impact continues and the amount of kindness ambassadors increases as more festivals
continue to join as the years go on.
With over 100 000 festivals taking place annually this 100 festivals a year is 0.001% which
increases the possibility of impact far greater than 100 as people begin to adopt the concept it is
likely we will have far more than 100 Kindfests a year.
As the impact grows within festivals we are rewarding people in social capital and changing the
social aspect of trade.
In the next ten years AIME has the capacity to create 1000 Kind Companies, companies
devoted to creating sustainable change and adopting a new unit of operation that is centred in
relational economy, as a lever in JOY Corp.
Without kindness at a organisations root true change in how we trade and use the world's
resources is harder to achieve

Why does kindness matter?
If we continue down the path where we prioritise competition over collaboration, can the world's
resources truly survive without embedding kindness into the fabric of operations?
Can kindness revolutionise the way we not only treat each other but the planet that gave us a
home?
What is economics? As Jack says it is simply another way of seeing life, it is a viewpoint set
from a particular perspective that defines value.
So what stops each and every one of us here being a part of defining where we choose to place
value?
Could kindness be something we can embed into the heart of global perception?
Why should we value Very Important Kind People?
Are human beings truly only as valuable as the financial equivalent we place on them or is there
another way?

Probably also important to say at the top that the true impact of a theatre show will be felt by
those in the room. Story was a metaphor for life - you came in confused, were asked to make
something together with others, to learn, to challenge yourself, to experience shame. And then
to perform, to open yourself to wonder, to laugh, to be nervous. All of this in a safe space to help
incubate imagination and make people think differently. The feedback that stuck with me the
most was from the Luna Park staff, who all jumped in to help us create something in a space
that is usually not a performance venue, who kept saying “I’ve never seen or done anything like
this before.” Through building relationships with them, we were able to achieve something
together that will have the most impact in how each and every person remembers and feels the
experience differently.

There is a great model that I've witnessed in action. Black Hole Theatre uses it "The Critical
Response Process is an innovative method for discussing an artist’s work with the artist and an
audience or group of “responders”. This method was developed by US choreographer Liz
Lerman and her associate John Borstel at Dance Exchange. It is now used by artists,
companies, and teachers across a wide range of forms and around the globe as a unique and
valuable tool for creative development.

Narratives drive our lives. Human beings think in stories, understand the world through stories,
make plans and decisions in stories and organize their lives in stories. Leaders in politics,
government and business use stories to explain what is happening and to inspire change.
Although stories drive our decisions about how and where to invest, how much to spend and
save, and help propel major economic events and policies, economists have systematically
neglected the role of narrative.
In a world in which internet troll farms attempt to influence foreign elections, can we afford to
ignore the power of stories to affect economies? In his groundbreaking book, Narrative
Economics: How Stories Go Viral & Drive Major Economic Events,​​Nobel Prize-winning
economist and New York Times bestselling author Robert Shiller examines how the stories we
tell about our lives and our society can spread from person to person, changing shared
perceptions of events and shaping economic behaviour. Using a rich array of historical
examples and data, Shiller argues that studying popular stories that affect individual and
collective economic behaviour- what he calls "narrative economics"- has the potential to vastly
improve our ability to predict, prepare for, and lessen the damage of financial crises, recessions,
depressions, and other major economic events.
Spread through the public in the form of popular stories, ideas can go viral and move
markets-whether it's the belief that tech stocks can only go up, that housing prices never fall, or
that some firms are too big to fail. Whether true or false, stories like these-transmitted by word of
mouth, by the news media, and increasingly by social media drive the economy by driving our
decisions about how and where to invest, how much to spend and save, and more. But despite
the obvious importance of such stories, most economists have paid little attention to them. Uponclose inspection, we’ll find that stories help propel economic events that have led to war, mass
unemployment, and increased inequality. And it is through story, that we can write a new
narrative for humanity.

The same applies if you look at the story of humanity’s relationship with Nature. Although we are
part of the natural world, the dominant narrative that emerged in recent times allowed for
humans to have dominion over all other species and thus we find ourselves in this complicated
space of being on red alert with our climate crisis, with humans freely extracting and polluting
the world around them and bringing so many species to the brink of extinction at an
unprecedented rate. Contrast this with the long deep story told by Indigenous peoples around
the world of being a part of Nature and playing an active custodial role in relation to other
species. This is the story we hope to return humankind to through AIME’s rich suite of soulful
stories.

IMAGI-NATION Minutes
SYNOPSIS
There is a “...race to the bottom of the brain stem” between social media companies.
Humans are a custodial species, in harmony we are in relation with those beyond our nuclear
family, we are in relation with nature, with many views, in many times. We are multi-lensed,
multidirectional, and at the very essence of human intelligence we have a wonderful little engine
room, connecting our mind, to our brain to our soul, I think of all our little people, old people, all
people, all animals, all elements, all time, dancing around inside us in our internal
IMAGI-NATION.
IMAGI-NATION as a network isn’t anything but a reminder.
“...I don’t want this to be addictive, to be so rich inside IMAGI-NATION that people forget their
own imagination, I want to have the network as a reminder for us all, if people really want to go
into IMAGI-NATION, let’s make it focused for a short time, maximum one year. On the outside of
IMAGI-NATION, let’s build the simplest possible technology, that anyone could build anywhere,
and that could be replicated offline with pencil and paper, or just as a thinking process.On the outside walls of IMAGI-NATION let’s invite people to not come in. Remind them, remind
you, that imagination is with you right now, and invite you to make an imagination minutes
pledge, then potentially turn off your screens and take back your 15 minutes, or 60 minutes, or 6
days. Take it, we shouldn’t create networks that steal your time, we should be gifting it back.”
Ultimately that’s the role of the mentor. To be a mentor and not a saviour.
To build one's capacity to be stronger without you.

Like an electric vehicle recharge station, never to be seen again, but critical for the energy to
keep that vehicle moving.
Or two rocks that Earth has left us, that when banged together, light a spark for a new fire.
That’s us. Billions of charges and charging stations, rocks and potential sparks, spirals of energy
spinning constantly, nurturing, and caring for life on Earth, holding the notes for a moment, then
passing it on.
I’m so hopeful that humanity can come into relation with each other. I’m so hopeful we can get
back to a place where nature is our hero, our living gods, our libraries, our place of worship, our
source of knowledge and intelligence and energy. And I’m hopeful when we face our
impermanence, we’ll move from competition to seeing our commonality, that we’ll unlock our
collective potential by staring through the end and seeing many many new beginnings.

Deep down I hope we can find inner peace. So often the struggle is not with the idea a person is
putting forward, or the action we can make. The struggle is with some internal pattern we have
inherited or developed, systemic weaves or personal melodies. And when we come into relation
internally with these notes, we can release ourselves and hear the music all around us, we can
play together.

IMPACT
“The real problem of humanity is the following:
We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology.”
— DR. E.O. WILSON, SOCIOBIOLOGIST
Social media reinforces certain negative patterns by triggering the release of dopamine, a
chemical in the brain that makes you feel good. The constant novelty and endless scrolling
content create an addictive cycle of refreshing, much like someone in Las Vegas playing a slot
machine.Mass General Brigham McLean, “The Social Dilemma: Social Media and Your Mental Health”
Platforms and apps, like YouTube, often provide a feeling of community. When used for genuine
connection, it can be a valuable tool. However, these platforms take advantage of our instinct to
belong. Throughout human history, belonging to a group was necessary for our survival; our
brains are wired to care what people think of us.
D
R
AF
TI
N
G
When we receive social validation, the reward centers in our brain light up, triggering a release
of more dopamine. Even the expectation of a positive reward releases more of that feel-good
chemical which keeps us coming back during times of anxiety and stress.
We become conditioned to seek regular and constant feedback with likes, comments, and
shares. This creates a cycle of increased social media use and a decrease in mental health.
https://www.humanetech.com/attention-mental-health
Regular social media use also has a negative impact on our attention span. Rapidly changing
content and constant interruptions reduce our capacity to pay attention; we become used to
quick sound bites and short videos. A recent survey found that the ideal TikTok video was
between 21 to 34 seconds, with many avid users reporting that they find longer videos
“stressful.”
AL
W
AY
S
Gloria Mark, a professor at UC Irvine, found that we’ve become so accustomed to interruptions
that we begin to create them ourselves. Even when we’re at work, we can’t escape these
notifications, with the average person checking their email 74 times a day.
TikTok is killing your brain, one short-form video at a time. (2022, September 18). Social Media
Psychology. https://socialmediapsychology.eu/2022/08/18/tiktok-is-killing-your-brain-right-now/
The unpredictability, coupled with social validation features, keeps you coming back.
The attention economy refers to the idea that attention is a scarce resource, and therefore, it
has economic value. In other words, the more attention something or someone can attract, the
more valuable it becomes.
The attention economy is often associated with the rise of digital media and the internet, as
these technologies have created an abundance of information and entertainment options that
compete for people's attention. This has led to the development of new business models and
marketing strategies that focus on capturing and holding people's attention.
Social media platforms, for example, are designed to keep users engaged and scrolling for as
long as possible, as this increases the amount of attention that can be monetized through
advertising or other revenue streams. In the attention economy, companies and individuals
compete not only for market share or sales, but also for people's attention and time.Everyone wants to be noticed and feel like they belong, but it's hard to capture people's
attention. Our need for attention and belonging is rooted in our DNA and the need to be part of a
community. However, since we no longer live in the same type of community as our prehistoric
ancestors, we can become desperate for attention and belonging. This can lead to unhealthy
behaviors and a constant search for online fame.
D
R
AF
TI
N
G
We may think we're pursuing money, position, or awards, but what we really need is the
assurance from our peers that we're liked, included, and safe. Unfortunately, even extreme
wealth or power can't satisfy our need for belonging, as it's a local and personal experience.
If we realize that small, in-person groups are the key to fulfilling our need for attention and
belonging, we can start building a world where we all feel seen and connected.
Our economy is driven by where we place our attention, that's what shapes value, the heroes
we hold up and the people we let into the clubs.
Reclaiming healthier ways of living and fighting against the attention economy requires a
conscious effort to prioritize our values, relationships, and well-being over the constant
stimulation and distractions that the attention economy provides.
Imagination can be a powerful tool to help address the issues of the attention economy and the
search for belonging. By engaging in imaginative thinking, we can explore new possibilities and
perspectives, and develop creative solutions to these challenges.
AL
W
AY
S
For example, by imagining new ways of connecting with others, we can find alternative forms of
social interaction that don't rely on the attention-grabbing tactics of the attention economy. We
can imagine creating local communities and networks where people can connect in person and
build meaningful relationships based on shared interests and values.
Imagination can also help us prioritize our values and goals, and envision a future where these
priorities are reflected in our daily lives. By using our imagination to visualize what we truly want
and need, we can make more intentional choices about how we spend our time and attention,
and find fulfillment in activities that align with our priorities.
In addition, imagination can help us cultivate empathy and understanding for others, which can
be a key factor in building strong, meaningful relationships. By using our imagination to put
ourselves in others' shoes, we can develop a deeper sense of compassion and connection that
can help counteract the isolation and disconnection of the attention economy.
Social media platforms – like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok – are financially
incentivized to amplify the most engaging content. This leads to an overrepresentation of fake
news, disinformation, and divisive content. The cumulative impact on our information
environment over the past 10+ years has increased polarization, election interference,
legislative lockup, and other manipulative practices that undermine democracies world-wide.D

Building 20 at MIT and Warhol's Factory were significant cultural and historical experiences that
had an impact on global culture.
Building 20 was a temporary building on the MIT campus that was constructed during World
War II to house the school's Radiation Laboratory. Despite its temporary nature and lack of
architectural merit, Building 20 became a hub of innovation and creativity that spawned
numerous breakthroughs in fields ranging from linguistics and psychology to computer science
and music.
The open, flexible design of Building 20 allowed researchers and scholars from diverse
disciplines to interact and collaborate in a way that was not possible in more formal academic
settings. This led to an atmosphere of creativity and experimentation that gave rise to numerous
innovations, including the creation of the first video game, the development of modern
linguistics, and groundbreaking research in the field of acoustics.

Warhol's Factory was a creative studio and social scene that was established by artist Andy
Warhol in the 1960s. The Factory became a cultural hotspot where artists, musicians, writers,
and other creatives gathered to collaborate, experiment, and push the boundaries of art and
culture.
The Factory was a place where Warhol and his collaborators could freely explore new ideas and
push the limits of art and popular culture. It became a symbol of the countercultural movement
of the 1960s and had a profound impact on the art world, influencing subsequent movements
such as pop art, conceptual art, and performance art.
The Factory also played a significant role in shaping popular music, with many notable
musicians of the era, including Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, collaborating with Warhol
and recording albums at the studio.
In summary, both Building 20 at MIT and Warhol's Factory were influential hubs of innovation
and creativity that had a significant impact on their respective fields. Building 20 paved the way
for interdisciplinary collaboration and groundbreaking research, while Warhol's Factory pushed
the boundaries of art and popular culture and influenced subsequent artistic movements.

One of the positive financial impacts of travelling to the Imagination Factory is that it can spark
creativity and innovation within R&D teams. AIME, the organisation behind the Imagination
Factory, is known for its out-of-the-box thinking and unconventional approach to problem-solving
the world’s most pressing issues. By bringing R&D teams into this environment, companies can
experience thinking that is based on 60,000 years of intelligence while sparking new ideas and
approaches to their own work processes. The result is creation of new products, processes, and
strategies that can increase the company's bottom line while centering relationships that respect
nature.
Another financial benefit of visiting the Imagination Factory is that it can lead to new
partnerships and collaborations for organizaitons with a desire to collaborate within sustainable
driven networks. AIME has a diverse network of partners, including universities, startups, and
other intelligence of people from over 50 countries. By connecting with these partners during the
immersive R&D experience inside the Imagination Factory, R&D teams can expand their own
network and potentially find new opportunities for growth and innovation.
Part 2: The Social Impact of Travelling to the Imagination Factory

The Imagination Factory is a place where intelligence that was traditionally outside the margins
is centred. AIME is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of its
work, and this is reflected in the diverse community of creatives and innovators who work there.
By bringing R&D teams to the Imagination Factory, they can learn from and interact with nature
and people from different backgrounds and perspectives, which can broaden their own
understanding and lead to more inclusive and empathetic approaches to their work.
Furthermore, visiting the Imagination Factory can have a positive impact on the morale and
motivation of R&D teams. Working in a creative and inspiring environment does boost
productivity and engagement, and the opportunity to collaborate with other creatives and
innovators is energizing and inspiring.
Part 3: Deepening R&D by Visiting the Imagination Factory
During their visit to the Imagination Factory, R&D teams will learn how to apply unlikely
connections by five to increase their relationship with nature and imagination and a byproduct is
an increase to the company’s bottom line. AIME's approach to problem-solving involves making
connections between seemingly disparate ideas, concepts, and fields. This can lead to
innovative solutions and approaches that would not have been possible otherwise.By experiencing this approach firsthand, R&D teams can learn how to apply this way of thinking
to their own work. They can learn how to identify and make connections between seemingly
unrelated ideas, which can lead to new insights and approaches to their research and
development. This can result in more innovative and effective products, processes, and
strategies, which can ultimately increase the company's bottom line.

For sceptics of this process of learning for development we look to a widely known investor who
has profited by spending time to gather knowledge from inside and outside of the margins.
Warren Buffett spends a significant amount of time each day on research and learning. In fact,
he has famously said that he spends 80% of his day reading and thinking.
Buffett has also stated that he spends about six hours each day reading newspapers, annual
reports, trade publications, and other materials related to his investments. This dedication to
research and learning has been a key factor in his success as an investor.
In addition to reading and researching, Buffett also spends time speaking with executives and
industry experts to gain insights into potential investments. He is known for his careful and
thorough analysis of companies before investing in them, and his dedication to research is a big
part of that process.

RE-SERVE BANK
SYNOPSISRe-serve Bank functions as the economic lubricant within the AIME network by
producing its native currency, the JOY Token. It also serves as a bridge between
IMAGI-NATION and the world beyond by generating a digital currency, grounded in
relational economics, that can be traded on the open market.
This digital currency is backed by a physical currency as well, the AIME Hoodie, which
has a long history of generating positive social change through placing value on
invaluable actions such as joy, kindness, mentoring and so on.
- How are coins generated?
- Tokens can be earned by organisations as they work through the process of
becoming a JOY Corp .To become a JOY Corp organisations must activate
seven levers internally.
- Mentors as the ultimate citizens mapping a network for all
- Intelligence from outside the margins centred with unlikely connections
- Kindness as our stimulus for our relational health
- Nature as our source of intelligence for planetary health
- Joy as the impact measurement for relational wealth
- Peace as the pathway for progress to unfold
- Regeneration / Intentional death for long future health of the network - all
in relation
- Once organisations can successfully demonstrate that a lever has been
implemented the bank will then release a fixed number of JOY tokens. This
allows organisations to progressively change their practices over time and
gradually build up their holdings.
- Schools
- Individuals
- Trading
- JOY tokens will be tradable items that can be exchanged beyond the world of
IMAGI-NATION. Organisations that sit outside of the digital world can purchase
the currency as a means of increasing the value of the coins and in turn placing
greater value on a relational nature based currency. This mechanism also serves
as a means of offsetting business practices that are purely transactional do not
engage directly with IMAGI-NATION
PARTNERS
- Simba Global have provided 50,000 Hoodies as the backing currency for the digital
tokens to be issued
- The Hoodies will be designed and printed in collaboration with 1000s of humans that will
visit AIME’s IMAGI-NATION {Factory} in Sydney and create a custom hoodie for
someone who comes after them
- Venture Crowd / Vest are working with us on the digital currency aka JOY token

IMPACT
Through the Re-Serve Bank, we will oversee the economic impacts of all the projects we’re
working on, and codify the varied economic models that will emerge from all our systemic work.The impact would be to provide an at-scale alternative to the current capitalist worldview and
framework, which as aforementioned, has excluded the masses for the benefit of the few elite.
By using the Hoodie as a tangible currency, supplemented by a digital token (see section on
JOY towards the end) and the issuance of passports to track the change created by every
member of IMAGI-NATION, we will present a global case study of how economies and nations
might begin to value things beyond just the $.

Another parallel emergence, from the increasing use of AI, especially in the more developed
nations, is the groups of people who will have access to enough material resources and may not
need to work, as more and more jobs get automated. This has started happening already in
pockets of the world. Also in developing and under-developed countries, the lack of work will
lead to increased hopelessness and despondency. In both these situations, we need to find
value beyond just the $ and ignite people’s passions and purpose in life. Through the Re-Serve
Bank, we will model how banks around the world can start centering ‘service’ and ‘kindness’ (we
mean, actions that uplift others around us, human and non-human) and become drivers of not
just monetary gain, but of human potential.

Meeting Place powered by AIME is a digital playground that aims to create the largest talent
pipeline of marginalized talent in the world. It consists of an Imagination University of 1M
Presidents, who are university students, linked in a web to 1000 JOY Corps, which are
corporations, startups, and public entities worldwide. Inside Meeting Place powered by AIME is
1000 Mentoring University students and 1000 Imagination Schools for primary to grade 12, and
1000 Systems Change Citizens, who are also known as social justice changemakers.
Meeting Place powered by AIME is designed to address the economic and social inequality that
exists in our world today. Communities who traditionally been outside the margins face
significant barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, and Meeting Place is
a bridge connecting them with corporations, startups, and public entities that are actively
seeking intelligence from outside the margins and multiplied through unlikely connections x5.
This platform also provides opportunities for mentorship and learning, which can help students
and young professionals develop their skills and advance their careers.
Meeting Place is different from LinkedIn in several ways. While LinkedIn is a professional
networking platform that aims to connect professionals with job opportunities, Meeting Place is
focused on connecting intelligence that has traditionally been outside of the margins with
opportunities to share their knowledge with people who are inside the margins. Meeting Place
also provides a platform for learning and mentorship, which is not a primary focus of LinkedIn.
AL
W
AY
S
Investors who are interested in Meeting Place powered by AIME should consider the potential
economic impact of this platform. By creating the largest talent pipeline of talent that has
traditionally been left outside the margins, Meeting Place will unlock significant economic value.
Diverse talent brings fresh perspectives and ideas to companies and organizations, which can
help them innovate and grow. Additionally, by providing opportunities for mentorship and
learning, Meeting Place can help build bridges to a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce
of unlikely connections that are focused on respecting planet Earth, which will lead to increased
productivity and competitiveness.
To provide some context, LinkedIn was purchased by Microsoft in 2016 for $26.2 billion, making
it one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. While Meeting Place is still in its early stages, its
focus on connecting marginalized talent with opportunities and providing a platform for learning
and mentorship could make it an attractive investment opportunity for investors who are
interested in social impact and economic growth.
In summary, Meeting Place powered by AIME has the potential to create significant economic
and social impact by creating the largest talent pipeline of talent in the world and providing
opportunities for mentorship and learning. Investors should consider the potential economic
value of this platform, as well as its potential to drive positive social change.Scaling Meeting Place
Scaling Meeting Place from concept to 20 million citizens worldwide requires a relational map
and compassionate approach that involves several key steps. We don’t want to get people
hooked on feedback loops that lead to unhealthy patterns and actions. Here is our relational
roadmap for scaling Meeting Place powered by AIME:
Transparent & Clear Plan: The first step is to share the development process which
outlines a clear plan that relates to relational growth objectives. This plan includes
healthy human and tech interaction touchpoints, timeline for scaling, and budget.
●Focus on Connection & Healthy Usage: To scale Meeting Place powered by AIME it is
crucial to focus on designing based on 60,000 years of continuous knowledge and
pattern off the maps within nature's cycles. This will be achieved through various
relational channels such as festivals, imagination embassies, imagination fellows, and
film and television projects. The key is to identify the most effective channels for
reaching humans who want a healthier relationship with technology, nature, and other
humans.
●Build a Solid Journey: To respect humans who engage with Meeting Place powered by
AIME we encourage them to spread the word about the app, it is essential to provide a
transparent experience where we are not trying to game anyone but instead provide a
microphone to say we hear you and a mirror to symbolise that we see you. This design
frame includes intuitive design, smooth performance, and easy-to-use features.
●Leverage Data Analytics: Data analytics can help companies identify behaviour
patterns and optimize the app's features and human experience accordingly. This will
help to avoid traps of manipulation of data or temptation to profit off of human data.
●Focus on Relational Growth: Relational growth can be a powerful tool for scaling an
app to healthy adaption by youth who have traditionally been outside the margins. This
can be achieved by incorporating features that encourage humans to invite their friends
to join the app, encouraging conversations offline vs social sharing buttons.
●Invest in Infrastructure: As the human base grows, it is essential to invest in the
infrastructure necessary to support the increased traffic and engagement. This includes
server capacity, respectful database management, and cybersecurity so that the humans
are not exposed to unhealthy internet behaviour, while we can’t prevent all unhealthy
behaviour we will continue to put a safety first approach into the infrastructure of the
design.
●Foster a Community: Creating a strong community around the app can help to drive
growth and healthy retention. This will be achieved by providing forums for humans to
connect offline through Imagination bus stops and festivals, engaging with humans in

●real life face-to-face experiences, and hosting events while utilising our television and

Partner with Indigenous systems thinking: Partnering with Indigenous systems thinkers
worldwide can help to increase awareness and attract humans to be a part of the
Meeting Place experience. This can be done by offering access to our fellow library
which features or content in exchange for promoting kindness.
●Continuously Innovate: Finally, to be intentional in passing on the notes of what we’re
learning and continue to engage in healthy patterns with humans, it is essential to
continuously innovate and improve the app's features based on the feedback of the
humans engaging with Meeting Place powered by AIME.

THE SOUL OF THE STORY
Film & TV & Radio & Gallery
SYNOPSIS
AL
W
AY
S
Story is where everything moves, it’s where knowledge is stored and in story is where we can
be distracted, and moved towards the purchase of products, tools, ideas.
Empires have been built around story. Disney, ILM to name a few.
Netflix and the streaming services have created a relationship with Film and TV that has
completely disrupted our relationship with story. Story has been relabeled as content, which
when said another way means to be content, at peace, complete. The streaming platforms are
not about contentment, deep enriching stories, but about entrapment, addiction, and a battle for
eyeball minutes, and attention seconds.
Story modern story, fuelled by the streamers and social networks, has become a distraction, not
enhancement from reality. From life. From nature.
The backdrop in 2022 is that we have serious problems to solve, we are on red alert as a
species, the economic plates are melting as the pandemics virus leaves it’s societal flow on
effect, automation is accelerating, the robots are munching the jobs, food crises face us, and
what do we look to story for? For distraction, when it should be powering, solutions.Meaningful deep knowledge texts, intelligence incubated that can drive hope, case studies,
movement, imagination unleashed for the joy of our species to be able to unlock our potential
collective intelligence. Stories shaped from everyone, beyond identity politics, to knowledge, to
systemic patterns and shifting how when and from whom we shape value.

Our university systems are drowning, our government leaders are struggling to communicate
with disrupted media platforms and cycles, and the loudest ducks are grabbing the microphone
in social networks that demand and command us to the extremes of unbased opinion to create
division, movement, uncertainty which then drives inflammation and eventually fosters the ideal
environment of instability to sell products.
The facade of Disney is over, the business empire is real, the soul is not.
So what is the next storytelling empire? Will there be one that is like a Disney?
Simply no. We don’t think there will be or there should be. We think that there is a window for a
collection of The Soul’s of Story to be created around the world, micro studios, a decentralised
Hollywood, that will anchor and protect the Soul of the Story to be centred around purpose,
driven, moved, and shaped. Where the investment will provide freedom for artists to work with
those creating and shaping systemic change, where the advancements in AI will allow for a
democratisation of storytelling and the tools being placed in the hands of those locked out of the
current Hollywood playground by how much money they have. We see thousands of Soul’s of
the Story as investment models and we think this can be the first one.

By building a decentralised soulful story model, with authentic stories moving us collectively
towards healthier relations with each other and with nature, this might just be the greatest
opportunity we have to galvanise humanity as a whole and tap into our collective intelligence to
solve some of the greatest challenges of our times.
Within AIME, the IMAGI-NATION Show, led by our Professors, inspired by the ancient
knowledges of Indigenous systems and the more recent work by Sesame Workshop in bringing
these lovable characters to life, with Sesame Street being "perhaps the most vigorously
researched, vetted, and fretted-over program”, we believe their impact spanning 150 million kids
in 150 countries can be replicated and surpassed by our work in collection with other soulful
storytellers.IMAGINE the film will unlock a new form of audio-visual storytelling that is built from deep
wisdom unlocked through the Indigenous systems yarning method, and might potentially lead to
a whole new genre of filmmaking.
ECONOMIC MODEL
The model works like this.
D

G
Step 1 - Find the social change organisation with a bend for storytelling, that has the potential to
create and implement systems change.
Step 2 - Find the virtual production studio that is emerging.
Step 3 - Find the investor that wants to release the Soul of Story, and make some money along
the way.
Step 4 - The investor takes a stake in the virtual production studio, and provides the operating
capital for the virtual production company to spend 5 years creating TV shows and feature films,
not short form ads, deep knowledge texts, the investment allows the systems change groups to
be able to have their time bought to be artists, to deeply engage in R&D in real time working
with the groups that are going to change the world. The value and reputation of the Virtual
Production Studio is enhanced over the 5 years, the work and credibility of the Soul of the Story
enhances the value of the Virtual Production Studion, and after the 5 year mark there is an
option for the investor to sell or to go around again for another 5 year cycle.
AL
W
AY
S
Step 5 - We recommend a 10 year life cycle for the Soul of the Story and then an intentional
death strategy where the company is then sold off at the end of the 10 years. Scarcity. Lab.
Intentional. Soul stays pure.
In this case the first group is AIME - the global imagination lab solving the challenges of our
time, and VIZION, a world leader in Virtual Production.
The investment we are looking at is:
●
2M per year for 5 years for VIZION to go all in with leading R&D work with AIME on
creating imaginative film and TV production, for the imagination factory to be a global
Soul of the Story powerhouse.
For the return there is:
● 25% ownership of VIZION - currently valued at 10M (TBC)
● Soul of the Story and systems change with AIME which ups the value of VIZION
● Global legacy for other investors to copy and model the Soul of the Story fund concept.

1 Million IMAGI-NATION Presidents
SYNOPSIS
AL
W
AY
S
At the heart of the failings of our modern systems is our network inheritance. We have inherited
networks that explicitly set to, through colonial empires, exclude everything, and everything
except for those in the Royal Family. Economics was exclusive. And those pushed to the
margins, and removed from society included 7 million nature species we share this rock with, 20
billion billion animals, and the longest intelligence labs in human history, our Indigenous
knowledge systems labs and other deep thinking systemic patterns which mapped humanity in
our natural role, a custodian on the rock between all of the natural world, not excluded from it
extracting and dominating and destroying.
As we enter 2023, with humankind now on Red Alert, with one year set until the 100th
anniversary of the rights of the child, it is not time to bring the intelligence from outside the
margins back into the centre of our design system (insert hand animation). The 1 Million
IMAGI-NATION Presidents are those young people marginalised, by race, religion, class,
climate and those young people who desperately want to lead the solutions to solve the
systemic challenges which at the heart is how we shape our modern economies, the 1M
PResidents are set to undertake projects to return humanity to our custodial role with nature.

Unearth a central intelligence force of marginalised intelligence, the largest central job directory
in the world of the talent that has been systemically overlooked. Link that talent with the most
influential organisations, universities, and economic leaders in the world, to shape, design, and
create the world we want to live in for the next century and beyond.
This will revitalise institutions like the UN Youth Council with vibrancy and joy, with the creation
of a NATION, a space for us all - IMAGI-NATION.
THE ECONOMIC MODEL
This is a systems partnership funding model where we are looking for philanthropic donations to
power the core this road forward.
The reputational credit is the emancipating pathway which will alleviate network and status
inequity for 1 Million young people from outside the margins, and more broadly impact the social
and cultural belief systems on what intelligence looks like and where it comes from around the
world.JOY CORP

Token
Drawing from the carbon credit system could we establish a framework in which - tradeable JOY
tokens incentivises corporations to engage in a new economy grounded in nature, Indigenous
knowledge systems and hoodie economics. It would do this in two ways -
1. Corporations that aim to generate tokens by engaging with JOY and each of the seven levers
- a literal soul searching process - maybe there are 7 tokens that can be earned in total?
2. 2. Corporations that might not initially generate tokens but might look to offset their current
business practices by purchasing tokens.. this purchasing then incentives other orgs to
engage with JOY and generate their own tokens.
In turn JOY tokens could sit on a trading platform with other currencies that value nature, human
health, climate change etc and be interchangeable.. creating an entirely new set of currencies that
can only be generated by actions which help drive the change that humanity requires.
SYNOPSIS
Over the last 20 years AIME has been building a model of accreditation that centers joy,
kindness, nature & intelligence from outside the margins into the DNA of corporations &
organisations.

We as a species are not sick, the networks are. We have inherited networks that by intention
excluded nature and most human beings. Now, outside the margins, with those people whose
systems have been previously devalued we are learning and understanding that Indigenous
knowledge systems processes as one example showcase a much healthier relational economic
roadmap for us as species, with intelligence labs lasting beyond 60,000 years, this model of
societal mapping is the way forward, the intelligence from outside the margins, must be mapped
to the centre of our design frame.
The following are the seven systemic levers that JOY Corps get to design with to activate health
in the network.

After 20 years of patterning networks between those inside and outside the margins, we know
that our current organisational structures broadly don’t value relations, or allow room to measure
joy, or kindness. The underlying economic frame is driven by a system that encourages secrets
to be kept, not knowledge shared openly by mentors, it doesn’t look at death as a natural
phenomenon of systemic health and regeneration, it encourages competition not peace, it
forces us to hide in our camps and affirm our biases politically dividing and conquering with a
fear of the other which affirms what we know, and who we know, decreasing our greatest
process of intelligence – imagination, instead of building rich regenerative networks via unlikely
connections with other human beings, other knowledge, other species, and in doing so
activating a networked regenerative imaginative intelligence.
Over the next 10 years JOY Corp will build a case study of 1000 organisations that generate
healthier patterns & networks into their operations in order to create a healthier, fairer, joyful
and regenerative system for all people and the plant.
