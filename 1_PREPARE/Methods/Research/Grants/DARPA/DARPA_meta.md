## DARPA Offices 

DARPA’s research portfolio is managed by six technical offices charged with developing breakthrough technologies and additional offices that manage special projects and the transition of DARPA-funded technologies into Department of Defense capabilities. The Agency benefits from contributions by a number of support offices as well.

### Biological Technologies Office
DARPA’s Biological Technologies Office (BTO) develops capabilities that embrace the unique properties of biology and applies those features to revolutionize how the United States protects its Warfighters. BTO is helping the Department of Defense expand technology-driven capabilities in two thrust areas: warfighter readiness, to support readiness, health, and recovery, and operational biotechnology to create operational advantages and sustainable operations.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Bio-complexity | Bio-systems | Disease | Health | Med-Devices | Syn-Bio

### Defense Sciences Office
DARPA's Defense Sciences Office (DSO) identifies and pursues high-risk, high-payoff research initiatives across a broad spectrum of science and engineering disciplines and transforms them into important, new game-changing technologies for U.S. national security. Current DSO themes include novel materials and structures, sensing and measurement, computation and processing, enabling operations, collective intelligence, and emerging threats. DSO relies on the greater scientific research community to help identify and explore ideas that could potentially revolutionize the state-of-the-art.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Autonomy | Complexity | Fundamentals | Materials | Math | Sensors

### Information Innovation Office
DARPA’s Information Innovation Office (I2O) creates groundbreaking science and develops transformational capabilities in the informational and computational spheres to surprise adversaries and maintain enduring advantage for national security.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Algorithms | Artificial Intelligence | Cognitive Science | Cyber | Data | Language | ML | Networking | Privacy | Processing | Programming | Trust

### Microsystems Technology Office
The Microsystems Technology Office’s (MTO) core mission is to develop high-performance intelligent microsystems and next-generation components to ensure U.S. dominance in the areas of Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Directed Energy (DE). The effectiveness, survivability, and lethality of these systems depend critically on the microsystems contained inside.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Decentralization | Electronics | EW | Globalization | Microsystems | Mobile | Photonics | PNT | Spectrum

### Strategic Technology Office
DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office (STO) develops technology to give national security leaders trusted, disruptive capabilities to win in all physical domains (air, space, sea, and land) and across the spectrum of competition, from deterrence to high-end peer combat.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Air | Communications | Countermeasures | EW | ISR | Mobile | Spectrum | Tech-Foundations

### Tactical Technology Office
The mission of DARPA/TTO is to provide or prevent strategic and tactical surprise with very high-payoff, high-risk development and demonstration of revolutionary new platforms in Ground Systems, Maritime (Surface and Undersea) Systems, Air Systems, and Space Systems.

**Focus Areas:** Agency | Air | Ground | ISR | Maritime | Munitions | Robotics | Space
