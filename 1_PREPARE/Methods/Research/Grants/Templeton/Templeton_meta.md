# John Templeton Foundation: A Comprehensive Overview

## History and Mission

Founded in 1987 by Sir John Templeton, a renowned investor and philanthropist, the John Templeton Foundation has become a pivotal force in funding interdisciplinary research and fostering conversations that inspire awe and wonder. Sir John, who began his career on Wall Street in 1937, was known for his contrarian thinking and investment acumen. His passion for understanding value eventually broadened to encompass fields like theology and philanthropy.

The Foundation's mission reflects Sir John's belief in the importance of open-minded research and progress in spiritual understanding. Their motto, "How little we know, how eager to learn," encapsulates this approach and drives their commitment to exploring life's biggest questions.

## Funding Areas and Scope

The John Templeton Foundation funds work across a diverse range of subjects, including:

1. Science and the big questions
2. Character virtue development
3. Individual freedom and free markets
4. Genetics
