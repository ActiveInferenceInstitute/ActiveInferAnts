Abbott: So, you want to know about the Meta-Grants Methodology?
Costello: Yeah, I need to understand the whole process. Who's on first?
Abbott: No, no, no. First, we have the PreProGrants_Write.py.
Costello: Okay, so what's on second?
Abbott: No, second is ProGrant_Write-with-LLM.py.
Costello: I don't know...
Abbott: That's on third! But let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we generate pre-pro-grants.
Costello: Pre-pro-what?
Abbott: Pre-pro-grants. They are the inputs for the grant writing tool.
Costello: And then?
Abbott: Then we use ProGrant_Write-with-LLM.py to generate pro-grants.
Costello: Pro-grants? What's that?
Abbott: A pro-grant is a fully specified and answered Catechism that serves as the basis for generating a complete grant proposal.
Costello: So, who reviews these pro-grants?
Abbott: ProGrant_Review-with-LLM.py does.
Costello: And what does it do?
Abbott: It conducts comprehensive reviews of the generated pro-grants.
Costello: And after that?
Abbott: We summarize the grants using Grants_Summarize-with-LLM.py.
Costello: And then?
Abbott: We perform meta-analysis on the pro-grants with ProGrant_Meta-Analysis.py.
Costello: And what about the pre-pro-grants?
Abbott: We analyze those with PreProGrant_Meta-Analysis.py.
Costello: So, who does what?
Abbott: Exactly!
Costello: I don't know...
Abbott: Third base!
