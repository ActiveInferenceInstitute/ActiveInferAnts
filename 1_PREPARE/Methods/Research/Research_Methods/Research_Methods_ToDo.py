## Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up livestreaming environment
   - [ ] Choose a streaming platform (e.g., Twitch, YouTube Live)
   - [ ] Set up OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) for screen capture and streaming
   - [ ] Test audio and video quality
   - [ ] Create a schedule for regular coding sessions

2. Prepare for the next coding session
   - [ ] Review the short-term goals and select a specific task to focus on
   - [ ] Gather necessary resources and documentation for the chosen task
   - [ ] Create a brief outline or pseudocode for the implementation
   - [ ] Set up a new branch in the repository for the upcoming changes

3. Engage with the community
   - [ ] Create a Discord server or similar platform for real-time interaction during streams
   - [ ] Announce the upcoming livestream on relevant social media platforms
   - [ ] Prepare a brief introduction to the project for new viewers
   - [ ] Consider creating a FAQ document to address common questions

Remember, the surprising nature of livestreaming code requires flexibility and adaptability. Be prepared to explain your thought process, handle unexpected issues, and interact with viewers in real-time. This new format offers an exciting opportunity for collaborative development and immediate feedback.
