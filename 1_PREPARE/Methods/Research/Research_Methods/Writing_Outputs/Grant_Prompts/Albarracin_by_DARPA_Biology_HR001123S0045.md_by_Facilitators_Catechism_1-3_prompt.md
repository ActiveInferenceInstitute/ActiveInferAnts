Any resultant award negotiations will follow all pertinent law and regulation, and any negotiations and/or awards for procurement contracts will use procedures under FAR 15.4, Contract Pricing, as specified in the BAA.

BTO's mission is to develop capabilities that leverage the unique properties of biology - adaption, replication, resilience and complexity, to revolutionize how the United States defends the homeland and prepares and protects its Warfighters. Research in BTO creates biotechnological capabilities that provide tactical care and restore function to injured warfighters, increase operational resilience, develop novel functional materials, and detect and protect against threats to maintain force readiness.

BTO is interested in submissions related to the following topic areas:

#### General Topic:
- Biological technology topic areas that fit the national security scope of BTO’s mission.

#### Human Performance:
- Understanding and improving treatment of and resilience in neurological health, transformative neural processing, fatigue, cognition, and optimized human performance and teaming, including in extreme conditions.
- Discovering interventions that utilize biotechnology, biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science, social and behavioral science, and related disciplines to advance and optimize human performance and teaming, including in extreme conditions.
- Developing and leveraging technologies to advance continuous or near-continuous monitoring of physiology to elucidate mechanisms of human readiness and resilience.

### 2. Award Information
#### 2.1. GENERAL AWARD INFORMATION
Multiple awards are possible. The amount of resources made available under this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with proposers. The Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined to be necessary. If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options. Additionally, DARPA reserves the right to accept proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of proposals for award. In the event that DARPA desires to award only portions of a proposal, negotiations may be opened with that proposer. The Government reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work, as applicable.

The Government reserves the right to request any additional, necessary documentation once it makes the award instrument determination. Such additional information may include but is not limited to Representations and Certifications (see Section 6.2.3, “Representations and Certifications”). The Government reserves the right to remove proposers from award consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement on award terms, conditions, and/or cost/price within a reasonable time, and the proposer fails to timely provide requested additional information. Proposals identified for negotiation may result in a procurement contract, cooperative agreement, or other transaction, depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, whether or not the research is classified as Fundamental Research, and other factors.

Proposers looking for innovative, commercial-like contractual arrangements are encouraged to consider requesting Other Transactions. To understand the flexibility and options associated with Other Transactions, consult [DARPA Contract Management](http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/contractmanagement#OtherTransactions).

In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 4022(f), the Government may award a follow-on production contract or Other Transaction (OT) for any OT awarded under this solicitation if: (1) that participant in the OT, or a recognized successor in interest to the OT, successfully completed the entire prototype project provided for in the OT, as modified; and (2) the OT provides for the award of a follow-on production contract or OT to the participant, or a recognized successor in interest to the OT.

In all cases, the Government contracting officer shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type, regardless of instrument type proposed, and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. DARPA will apply publication or other restrictions, as necessary, if it determines that the research resulting from the proposed effort will present a high likelihood of disclosing performance characteristics of military systems or manufacturing technologies that are unique and critical to defense. Any award resulting from such a determination will include a requirement for DARPA permission before publishing any information or results on the program. For more information on publication restrictions, see the section below on Fundamental Research.

#### 2.2. FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189 defines fundamental research as follows:

> ‘Fundamental research’ means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.

As of the date of publication of this solicitation, the Government cannot identify whether the work under this solicitation may be considered fundamental research and may award both fundamental and non-fundamental research.

University or non-profit research institution performance under this solicitation may include effort categorized as fundamental research. In addition to Government support for free and open scientific exchanges and dissemination of research results in a broad and unrestricted manner, the academic or non-profit research performer or recipient, regardless of tier, acknowledges that such research may have implications that are important to U.S. national interests and must be protected against foreign influence and exploitation. As such, the academic or non-profit research performer or recipient agrees to comply with the following requirements:

(a) The University or non-profit research institution performer or recipient must establish and maintain an internal process or procedure to address foreign talent programs, conflicts of commitment, conflicts of interest, and research integrity. The academic or non-profit research performer or recipient must also utilize due diligence to identify Foreign Components or participation by Senior/Key Personnel in Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs and agree to share such information with the Government upon request.
  - i. The above described information will be provided to the Government as part of the proposal response to the solicitation and will be reviewed and assessed prior to award. Generally, this information will be included in the Research and Related Senior/Key Personnel Profile (Expanded) form (SF-424) required as part the proposer’s submission through Grants.gov.
    1. Instructions regarding how to fill out the SF-424 and its biographical sketch can be found through Grants.gov.
  - ii. In accordance with USD(R&E) direction to mitigate undue foreign influence in DoD-funded science and technology, DARPA will assess all Senior/Key Personnel proposed to support DARPA grants and cooperative agreements for potential undue foreign influence risk factors relating to professional and financial activities. This will be done by evaluating information provided via the SF-424, and any accompanying or referenced documents, in order to identify and assess any associations or affiliations the Senior/Key Personnel may have with foreign strategic competitors or countries that have a history of intellectual property theft, research misconduct, or history of targeting U.S. technology for unauthorized transfer. DARPA’s evaluation takes into consideration the entirety of the Senior/Key Personnel’s SF-424, current and pending support, and biographical sketch, placing the most weight on the Senior/Key Person’s professional and financial activities over the last 4 years. The majority of foreign entities lists used to make these determinations are publicly available. The DARPA Countering Foreign Influence Program (CFIP) “Senior/Key Personnel Foreign Influence Risk Rubric” details the various risk ratings and factors. The rubric can be seen at the following link: [DARPA CFIP Rubric](https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/092021DARPACFIPRubric.pdf)
  - iii. Examples of lists that DARPA leverages to assess potential undue foreign influence factors include, but are not limited to:
    1. Executive Order 13959 “Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments That Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies”: [Executive Order 13959](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-11-17/pdf/2020-25459.pdf)

    6. Various Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) products regarding targeting of US technologies, adversary targeting of academia, and the exploitation of academic experts: [DCSA](https://www.dcsa.mil/)
(b) DARPA’s analysis and assessment of affiliations and associations of Senior/Key Personnel is compliant with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Information regarding race, color, or national origin is not collected and does not have bearing in DARPA’s assessment.
(c) University or non-profit research institutions with proposals selected for negotiation that have been assessed as having high or very high undue foreign influence risk, will be given an opportunity during the negotiation process to mitigate the risk. DARPA reserves the right to request any follow-up information needed to assess risk or mitigation strategies.
  - i. Upon conclusion of the negotiations, if DARPA determines, despite any proposed mitigation terms (e.g. mitigation plan, alternative research personnel), the participation of any Senior/Key Research Personnel still represents high risk to the program, or proposed mitigation affects the Government’s confidence in proposer’s capability to successfully complete the research (e.g., less qualified Senior/Key Research Personnel) the Government may determine not to award the proposed effort. Any decision not to award will be predicated upon reasonable disclosure of the pertinent facts and reasonable discussion of any possible alternatives while balancing program award timeline requirements.

scientific exchanges and dissemination of research results in a broad and unrestricted manner, the
academic or non-profit research performer or recipient, regardless of tier, acknowledges that
such research may have implications that are important to U.S. national interests and must be
protected against foreign influence and exploitation. As such, the academic or non-profit
research performer or recipient agrees to comply with the following requirements:
(a) The University or non-profit research institution performer or recipient must establish
and maintain an internal process or procedure to address foreign talent programs,
conflicts of commitment, conflicts of interest, and research integrity. The academic or
non-profit research performer or recipient must also utilize due diligence to identify
Foreign Components or participation by Senior/Key Personnel in Foreign Government
Talent Recruitment Programs and agree to share such information with the Government
upon request.
i. The above described information will be provided to the Government as part of

ii. In accordance with USD(R&E) direction to mitigate undue foreign influence in
DoD-funded science and technology, DARPA will assess all Senior/Key
Personnel proposed to support DARPA grants and cooperative agreements for
potential undue foreign influence risk factors relating to professional and financial
activities. This will be done by evaluating information provided via the SF-424,
and any accompanying or referenced documents, in order to identify and assess
any associations or affiliations the Senior/Key Personnel may have with foreign
strategic competitors or countries that have a history of intellectual property theft,
research misconduct, or history of targeting U.S. technology for unauthorized
transfer. DARPA’s evaluation takes into consideration the entirety of the
Senior/Key Personnel’s SF-424, current and pending support, and biographical
sketch, placing the most weight on the Senior/Key Person’s professional and
financial activities over the last 4 years. The majority of foreign entities lists used
to make these determinations are publicly available. The DARPA Countering
Foreign Influence Program (CFIP) “Senior/Key Personnel Foreign Influence Risk
Rubric” details the various risk ratings and factors. The rubric can be seen at the
following link:

1. Association is defined as collaboration, coordination or interrelation,
professionally or personally, with a foreign government-connected entity
where no direct monetary or non-monetary reward is involved.
2. Affiliation is defined as collaboration, coordination, or interrelation,
professionally or personally, with a foreign government-connected entity
where direct monetary or non-monetary reward is involved.
iii. Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs
1. In general, these programs will include any foreign-state-sponsored
attempt to acquire U.S. scientific-funded research or technology through
foreign government-run or funded recruitment programs that target
scientists, engineers, academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs of all
nationalities working and educated in the U.S.
2. Distinguishing features of a Foreign Government Talent Recruitment
Program may include:
a. Compensation, either monetary or in-kind, provided by the foreign
state to the targeted individual in exchange for the individual
transferring their knowledge and expertise to the foreign country.
b. In-kind compensation may include honorific titles, career
advancement opportunities, promised future compensation or other
types of remuneration or compensation.
c. Recruitment, in this context, refers to the foreign-state-sponsor’s
active engagement in attracting the targeted individual to join the
foreign-sponsored program and transfer their knowledge and
expertise to the foreign state. The targeted individual may be
employed and located in the U.S. or in the foreign state. 
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
12
d. Contracts for participation in some programs that create conflicts
of commitment and/or conflicts of interest for researchers. These
contracts include, but are not limited to, requirements to attribute
awards, patents, and projects to the foreign institution, even if
conducted under U.S. funding, to recruit or train other talent
recruitment plan members, circumventing merit-based processes,
and to replicate or transfer U.S.-funded work in another country.
e. Many, but not all, of these programs aim to incentivize the targeted
individual to physically relocate to the foreign state. Of particular
concern are those programs that allow for continued employment
at U.S. research facilities or receipt of U.S. Government research
funding while concurrently receiving compensation from the
foreign state.
3. Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs DO NOT include:
a. Research agreements between the University and a foreign entity,
unless that agreement includes provisions that create situations of
concern addressed elsewhere in this section,
b. Agreements for the provision of goods or services by commercial
vendors, or
c. Invitations to attend or present at conferences.
iv. Conflict of Interest
1. A situation in which an individual, or the individual’s spouse or dependent
children, has a financial interest or financial relationship that could
directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, reporting, or funding
of research.
v. Conflict of Commitment
1. A situation in which an individual accepts or incurs conflicting obligations
between or among multiple employers or other entities.
2. Common conflicts of commitment involve conflicting commitments of
time and effort, including obligations to dedicate time in excess of
institutional or funding agency policies or commitments. Other types of
conflicting obligations, including obligations to improperly share
information with, or withhold information from, an employer or funding
agency, can also threaten research security and integrity and are an
element of a broader concept of conflicts of commitment.
vi. Foreign Component
1. Performance of any significant scientific element or segment of a program
or project outside of the U.S., either by the University or by a researcher
employed by a foreign organization, whether or not U.S. government
funds are expended.
2. Activities that would meet this definition include, but are not limited to:
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
13
a. Involvement of human subjects or animals;
b. Extensive foreign travel by University research program or project
staff for the purpose of data collection, surveying, sampling, and
similar activities;
c. Collaborations with investigators at a foreign site anticipated to
result in co-authorship;
d. Use of facilities or instrumentation at a foreign site;
e. Receipt of financial support or resources from a foreign entity; or
f. Any activity of the University that may have an impact on U.S.
foreign policy through involvement in the affairs or environment
of a foreign country.
3. Foreign travel is not considered a Foreign Component.
vii. Strategic Competitor
1. A nation, or nation-state, that engages in diplomatic, economic or
technological rivalry with the United States where the fundamental
strategic interests of the U.S are under threat.
Proposers should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research
included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While proposers should clearly explain the
intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to determine
whether the proposed research shall be considered fundamental and to select the award
instrument type. Appropriate language will be included in resultant awards for non-fundamental
research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate. This
language can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/additional-baa.
For certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research to be performed by a
potential awardee is non-fundamental research, its proposed subawardee’s effort may be
fundamental research. It is also possible that the research performed by a potential awardee is
fundamental research while its proposed subawardee’s effort may be non-fundamental research.
In all cases, it is the potential awardee’s responsibility to explain in its proposal which proposed
efforts are fundamental research and why the proposed efforts should be considered fundamental
research.
3. Eligibility Information
3.1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that
shall be considered by DARPA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses,
Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals
and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this announcement will be set
aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or
severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
14
3.1.1. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government
Entities
FFRDCs
FFRDCs are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this
solicitation in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions. (1) FFRDCs must clearly
demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector. (2)
FFRDCs must provide a letter, on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization, that (a)
cites the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations
and compete with industry, and (b) certifies the FFRDC’s compliance with the associated
FFRDC sponsor agreement’s terms and conditions. These conditions are a requirement for
FFRDCs proposing to be awardees or subawardees.
Government Entities
Government Entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions,
etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations. Government Entities must clearly
demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written
documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant,
establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry. This
information is required for Government Entities proposing to be awardees or subawardees.
Authority and Eligibility
At the present time, DARPA does not consider 15 U.S.C. § 3710a to be sufficient legal authority
to show eligibility. While 10 U.S.C.§ 4892 may be the appropriate statutory starting point for
some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency
approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility. DARPA will consider FFRDC and
Government Entity eligibility submissions on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove
eligibility for all team members rests solely with the proposer.
3.1.2. Non-U.S. Organizations
Non-U.S. organizations and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants
comply with any necessary nondisclosure agreements, security regulations, export control laws,
and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances.
3.2. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
FAR 9.5 Requirements
In accordance with FAR 9.5, proposers are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to
potential OCIs involving the proposer’s organization and any proposed team member
(subawardee, consultant). Under this Section, the proposer is responsible for providing this
disclosure with each proposal submitted to the solicitation. The disclosure must include the
proposer’s, and as applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation
plan must include a description of the actions the proposer has taken, or intends to take, to
prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the proposer’s judgment and to prevent
the proposer from having unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will
specifically discuss the disclosed OCI in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in
FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
15
Agency Supplemental OCI Policy
In addition, DARPA has a supplemental OCI policy that prohibits contractors/performers from
concurrently providing Scientific Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and
Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar support services and being a technical performer.
Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement above, a proposer must affirm whether
the proposer or any proposed team member (subawardee, consultant) is providing SETA, A&AS,
or similar support to any DARPA office(s) under: (a) a current award or subaward; or (b) a past
award or subaward that ended within one calendar year prior to the proposal’s submission date.
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is being or was provided to any DARPA office(s), the
proposal must include:
 The name of the DARPA office receiving the support;
 The prime contract number;
 Identification of proposed team member (subawardee, consultant) providing the support; and
 An OCI mitigation plan in accordance with FAR 9.5.
Government Procedures
In accordance with FAR 9.503, 9.504 and 9.506, the Government will evaluate OCI mitigation
plans to avoid, neutralize or mitigate potential OCI issues before award and to determine whether
it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The Government will only evaluate OCI
mitigation plans for proposals that are determined selectable under the solicitation evaluation
criteria and funding availability.
The Government may require proposers to provide additional information to assist the
Government in evaluating the proposer’s OCI mitigation plan.
If the Government determines that a proposer failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide
the affirmation of DARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the proposer’s OCI mitigation
plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for award.
3.3. COST SHARING/MATCHING
Cost sharing is not required; however, it will be carefully considered where there is an applicable
statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument. Cost sharing is encouraged where
there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed
research and development effort.

The awardee is responsible for compiling and providing all subawardee proposals for the
Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO)/Grants Officer (GO)/Agreements Officer (AO), as
applicable. Subawardee proposals should include Interdivisional Work Transfer Agreements
(ITWA) or similar arrangements. Where the effort consists of multiple portions which could
reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with
separate cost estimates for each.
All proprietary subawardee proposal documentation, prepared at the same level of detail as that
required of the awardee’s proposal and which cannot be uploaded with the proposed awardee’s
proposal, shall be provided to the Government either by the awardee or by the subawardee
organization when the proposal is submitted. Subawardee proposals submitted to the
Government by the proposed subawardee should be submitted via e-mail to the address in Part I.
Other Transaction (OT) Requests
All proposers requesting an OT must include a detailed list of milestones for each phase of the
program (I, II, and III). Each milestone must include the following:
 milestone description,
 completion criteria,
 due date, and
 payment/funding schedule (to include, if cost share is proposed, awardee and
Government share amounts).
It is noted that, at a minimum, milestones should relate directly to accomplishment of program
technical metrics as defined in the BAA and/or the proposer’s proposal. Agreement type,
expenditure or fixed-price based, will be subject to negotiation by the Agreements Officer. Do
not include proprietary data.
4.2.3. Additional Proposal Information
Proprietary Markings
Proposers are responsible for clearly identifying proprietary information. Submissions containing
proprietary information must have the cover page and each page containing such information
clearly marked with a label such as “Proprietary” or “Company Proprietary.” NOTE:
“Confidential” is a classification marking used to control the dissemination of U.S. Government
National Security Information as dictated in Executive Order 13526 and should not be used to
identify proprietary business information.
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies

Unclassified Submissions
DARPA anticipates that submissions received under this BAA will be unclassified. However,
should a proposer wish to submit classified information, an unclassified e-mail must be sent to
the BAA mailbox requesting submission instructions from the Technical Office Program
Security Officer (PSO). If a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access
to classified information, a Security Classification Guide (SCG) and/or DD Form 254 will be
issued by DARPA and attached as part of the award.
Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) – if anticipated/applicable
For unclassified proposals containing controlled unclassified information (CUI), applicants will
ensure personnel and information systems processing CUI security requirements are in place.
If an unclassified submission contains CUI or the suspicion of such, as defined by Executive
Order 13556 and 32 CFR Part 2002, the information must be appropriately and conspicuously
marked CUI in accordance with DoDI 5200.48. Identification of what is CUI about this DARPA
program will be detailed in a DARPA CUI Guide and will be provided as an attachment to the
BAA or may be provided at a later date.
Unclassified submissions containing CUI may be submitted via DARPA’s BAA Website
(https://baa.darpa.mil) in accordance with Section 4.2.4 of this BAA.
Proposers submitting proposals involving the pursuit and protection of DARPA information
designated as CUI must have, or be able to acquire prior to contract award, an information
system authorized to process CUI information IAW NIST SP 800-171 and DoDI 8582.01.
Disclosure of Information and Compliance with Safeguarding Covered Defense
Information Controls
The following provisions and clause apply to all solicitations and contracts; however, the
definition of “controlled technical information” clearly exempts work considered fundamental
research and therefore, even though included in the contract, will not apply if the work is
fundamental research.

5. Application Review Information
5.1. EVALUATION CRITERIA
Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:
5.1.1 Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; 5.1.2 Potential Contribution and Relevance to the
DARPA Mission; 5.1.3 Cost Realism.
5.1.1. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
The proposed technical approach is innovative, feasible, achievable, and complete.
The proposed technical team has the expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed tasks.
Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical
sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final outcome that achieves
the goal can be expected as a result of award. The proposal identifies major technical risks, and
planned mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible. The timeline for achieving major
milestones is aggressive but rationally supported with a clear description of the requirements and
risks. The proposer's prior experience in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to
deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance within the proposed budget and
schedule. The proposed team has the expertise to manage the cost and schedule.
5.1.2. Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission
The potential contributions of the proposed effort are relevant to the national technology base.
Specifically, DARPA’s mission is to make pivotal early technology investments that create or
prevent strategic surprise for U.S. National Security.
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
33
5.1.3. Cost Realism
The proposed costs are realistic for the technical and management approach and accurately
reflect the technical goals and objectives of the solicitation. The proposed costs are consistent
with the proposer's Statement of Work and reflect a sufficient understanding of the costs and
level of effort needed to successfully accomplish the proposed technical approach. The costs for
the prime proposer and proposed subawardees are substantiated by the details provided in the
proposal (e.g., the type and number of labor hours proposed per task, the types and quantities of
materials, equipment and fabrication costs, travel and any other applicable costs and the basis for
the estimates).
It is expected that the effort will leverage all available relevant prior research in order to obtain
the maximum benefit from the available funding. For efforts with a likelihood of commercial
application, appropriate direct cost sharing may be a positive factor in the evaluation. DARPA
recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may motivate proposers to offer low-risk ideas with
minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more
competitive posture. DARPA discourages such cost strategies.
5.2. REVIEW OF PROPOSALS
5.2.1. Review Process
It is the policy of DARPA to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal evaluations
based on the evaluation criteria listed in Section 5.1. and to select the source (or sources) whose
offer meets the Government's technical, policy, and programmatic goals.
DARPA will conduct a scientific/technical review of each conforming proposal. Conforming
proposals comply with all requirements detailed in this solicitation; proposals that fail to do so
may be deemed non-conforming and may be removed from consideration. Proposals will not be
evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work
statement. DARPA’s intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however,
proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.
Award(s) will be made to proposers whose proposals are determined to be the most
advantageous to the Government, consistent with instructions and evaluation criteria specified
in the BAA herein, and availability of funding.
5.2.2. Handling of Source Selection Information
DARPA policy is to treat all submissions as source selection information (see FAR 2.101 and
3.104) and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. Restrictive notices
notwithstanding, during the evaluation process, submissions may be handled by support
contractors for administrative purposes and/or to assist with technical evaluation. All DARPA
support contractors performing this role are expressly prohibited from performing DARPAsponsored technical research and are bound by appropriate nondisclosure agreements.
Subject to the restrictions set forth in FAR 37.203(d), input on technical aspects of the proposals
may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are strictly bound
by the appropriate non-disclosure requirements. 
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
34
5.2.3. Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information (FAPIIS)
Per 41 U.S.C. § 2313, as implemented by FAR 9.103 and 2 CFR § 200.205, prior to making an
award above the simplified acquisition threshold, DARPA is required to review and consider any
information available through the designated integrity and performance system (currently
FAPIIS). Awardees have the opportunity to comment on any information about themselves
entered in the database, and DARPA will consider any comments, along with other information
in FAPIIS or other systems, prior to making an award.
5.2.4. Countering Foreign Influence Program (CFIP)
DARPA’s CFIP is an adaptive risk management security program designed to help protect the
critical technology and performer intellectual property associated with DARPA’s research
projects by identifying the possible vectors of undue foreign influence. The CFIP team will
create risk assessments of all proposed Senior/Key Personnel selected for negotiation of a
fundamental research grant or cooperative agreement award. The CFIP risk assessment process
will be conducted separately from the DARPA scientific review process and adjudicated prior to
final award.

8. Other Information
8.1. UNIVERSITY FUNDING
In order to ensure that U.S. scientific and engineering students will be able to continue to make
strategic technological advances, DARPA is committed to supporting the work and study of
Ph.D. students and post-doctoral researchers that began work under a DARPA-funded program
awarded through an assistance instrument. Stable and predictable federal funding enables these
students to continue their scientific and engineering careers.
To that end, should a DARPA funded program awarded through a grant or cooperative
agreement with a university or a Research Other Transaction pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 4021 where
the university is a participant end (due to termination or down-select) before the planned
program completion, DARPA may continue to fund, for no more than two semesters (or
equivalent), the documented costs to employ or sponsor Ph.D. students and/or post-doctoral
researchers. Should such a circumstance arise, the following will take place:
1) The Government will provide appropriate notification to the University participant by the
Agreements Office or through the prime performer.
HR001123S0045, Biological Technologies
37
2) The University must make reasonable efforts to find alternative research or employment
opportunities for these students and researchers.
3) Before any costs will be paid, the University must submit documentation describing their
due diligence efforts in finding alternative arrangements that is certified by a University
official.
4) In addition to this documentation, the affected students and researchers must submit
statements of work describing what research activities they will pursue during the period
of funding and the final deliverable they will submit when the funding is complete.
5) In determining these costs, DARPA will rely on information from the University's
original proposal unless specific circumstances warrant requesting updated proposals. In
no circumstances will this funding be provided when the program is ended because of
suspected or actual fraud or negligence.
DARPA Down-Select Definition:
DARPA often structures programs in phases or options that include specific objectives and a
designated period of performance. This may result in potentially issuing multiple awards to
maximize the number of innovative approaches. This approach allows the Government to
monitor progress and enables programmatic decision points based, at a minimum, against stated
evaluation criteria, metrics, funding availability, and program goals and objectives. As a result,
select performers may advance via award of a subsequent phase or through exercise of a planned
option period.
