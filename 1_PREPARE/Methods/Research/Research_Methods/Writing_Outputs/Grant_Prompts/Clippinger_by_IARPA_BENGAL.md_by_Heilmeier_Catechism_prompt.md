• BAA Summary – IARPA is soliciting proposals for early-stage research (which IARPA refers
to as “seedlings”) for Bias Effects and Notable Generative AI Limitations (BENGAL).
Initially, interested parties are encouraged to submit a white paper so the Government can 
4
review their ability to meet the intent of the BAA. Formal proposals will then be encouraged
or not encouraged based on this white paper review. (See BAA Sections 4 and 5).
• Program Overview
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) invests in high-risk/highpayoff research programs that have the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming
intelligence advantage. IARPA seeks to develop new capabilities to enable the safe adoption
and use of generative AI technologies to greatly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of
the Intelligence Community (IC).
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive, human-seeming conversational
capabilities. LLMs and applications that build ‘on top’ of these models are being rapidly
adopted and are expected to transform work across diverse sectors. It is anticipated that the
public will interact with a massive number of LLM-derivative technologies within this decade.
Even at this early stage in their adoption, however, the public has observed that LLMs can
exhibit erroneous or potentially harmful behavior. The inherent characteristics of LLMs (ease
of use, human-like dialogue, complexity, and lack of explainability) present vulnerabilities for
benign applications and enable hostile applications. Models may conceal threats to users,
including quick generation of mis/disinformation or elicitation of sensitive information. These
threat modes may be unintended emergent artifacts of training complex models on vast and
poorly understood training data, or they may be intentionally incorporated into models by their
designers.
The IC is interested in safe uses of LLMs (multi-modal and text-only) for a wide variety of
applications including the rapid summarization and contextualization of multilingual
information relevant to the IC. These applications must avoid unwarranted biases and toxic
outputs, preserve attribution to original sources, and be free of erroneous outputs. The US
Government is also interested in identifying and mitigating hazardous use of LLMs by
potential nefarious actors.
The goal of the BENGAL targeted super seedling is to understand LLM threat modes, quantify
them and to find novel methods to correct threats and vulnerabilities or to work resiliently with
imperfect models. IARPA seeks to develop and incorporate novel technologies to efficiently
probe large language models to detect and characterize LLM threat modes and vulnerabilities.
Performers will focus on one or more of the topic domains below, clearly articulate a taxonomy
of threat modes within their domain of interest and develop technologies to detect, defeat or
mitigate these threats.
1.1 Technical Challenges and Objectives
IARPA seeks novel research ideas from multidisciplinary teams pursuing advanced research topics
capable of supporting the interests described below:
• Biases and induction of diverse analytical perspectives: The IC seeks capabilities to
enhance awareness of LLM output biases (cognitive, demographic, ideological, cultural,
temporal, etc.) that might suppress or promote relevant content with the effect of misleading a
user. IC users also greatly benefit from exposure to contrasting perspectives on the same event
or situation. IARPA is interested in novel technologies to accurately and automatically
characterize and detect biases, as well as leverage LLMs to induce diverse perspectives on
events or states of affairs. 
5
• AI hallucinations and inferences: Generative LLMs are known to produce spurious,
ungrounded outputs (‘hallucinations’ or ‘confabulations’) that can cause erroneous analysis
and decision making. Successful methods for reducing hallucinations constrain LLM outputs
to those that are in some fashion corroborated by ground truth (e.g., quotations from a trusted
document). However, constraints enforcing grounded outputs are over-restrictive and block
LLMs from drawing correct or plausible inferences, since good inferences are often not
(straightforwardly) based on ground truth evidence. IARPA is interested in capabilities that
detect spurious hallucinations while maximizing and inducing correct and plausible inferences.
• Safe information flow in sensitive environments: The IC’s classification system limits
access to sensitive information, which if disclosed to unauthorized individuals poses a grave
threat to national security. However, restricting information to certain people and systems can
pose a threat to national security by preventing critical collaborations and timely sharing of
critical information between IC organizations. IARPA is interested in LLM technologies that
increase the flow of information while minimizing the likelihood of sensitive information
disclosure, enabling safe use of LLMs over the broadest range of data and tasks. (Please note
that performers will not be permitted access or test systems on sensitive data; thus, offerors
must propose unclassified testing and evaluation schemes that credibly simulate environments
where sensitive information is stored but not all users are authorized to access it.)
• Working resiliently with imperfect or poisoned sources: The IC is interested in novel LLM
techniques to evaluate the reliability of specific information sources (e.g., news organizations,
individual content producers from around the world), especially sources whose content is used
to train LLMs or to interpret developing situations using LLMs in scenarios where only sparse
information is available. The IC is also interested in technologies that enable analysts and other
users to work resiliently with imperfect or malicious sources, identifying within their content
reliable information where possible.
Efforts addressing these topic areas align well with needs of the intelligence and national
security communities and are, therefore, under the purview of IARPA’s research mission.
Successful technological solutions will require creative, multidisciplinary methods, paradigm
changing thinking, and transformative approaches. Preference will be given to research with
the ability to revolutionize capabilities or demonstrate that revolutionary change is possible in
the coming decade.
This BAA solicits short-term, limited scope research in topic areas that are not addressed by
emerging or ongoing Government programs or other published solicitations. It is primarily, but
not solely, intended for early-stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a
separate BAA in the future.
1.2 Program Phases
This Targeted Super Seedling effort is structured as a Phase A (Base Period) with a Phase B
(Option Period). Phase A represents an initial Proof of Concept of the proposed approach. There
is no requirement that the Phase A capability include a user interface or that it be useable by
persons who are not programmers or system administrators. Phase B, if exercised, will build upon
the Proof-of-Concept research in Phase A to deliver a demonstration capability for use by potential
Government users who may not have computer programming or system administration expertise.
Phase A shall be of a duration of 12 months to demonstrate a prototype Proof of Concept, with
preliminary software deliverables and Performance Self-Evaluation Milestone reports due at 
6
months 4, 7 and 10.
BENGAL performers are expected to propose and implement their own testing and evaluation
protocols. An independent testing and evaluation (T&E) team will verify performer results and
validate software performance. Independent evaluation teams have not been selected for this effort,
but organizations serving in this capacity may include Government agencies, Federally Funded
Research and Development Corporations (FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers
(UARCs), or Department of Energy Labs. At the conclusion of Phase A, performers shall submit
a Final Report. Reports and deliverables shall be used in evaluation of projects for continuation to
Phase B. Phase B will be 12 months in duration. Shorter duration projects, if appropriate for the
subject matter, may be considered. See Figure 1 for a proposed project timeline.

White papers and proposals must explicitly address how the offeror’s technical approach will
enable the safe adoption and use of generative AI technologies within the IC. Offerors shall
demonstrate that the proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than
incremental, improvements to current capabilities. Research that primarily results in evolutionary
improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.
White papers and proposals must include offeror-defined objectives, as well as milestones and
performance metrics as task-driven intermediate steps towards the objectives. Offerors must 
7
clearly articulate tasks, quantitative metrics, and metric targets. Good metrics for the purpose of
this effort maximize interpretability, allow easy implementation/replicability, allow calculation of
confidence bounds, furnish results that are comparable over time, and are actionable (i.e., inform
changes in technical approach).
Testing and evaluation of performer systems will occur 3 times during each of the 12-month
phases. As noted above, successful submissions will clearly articulate a testing and evaluation
protocol that can be either run on the performer site and validated by the T&E team or replicated
by T&E using T&E’s own infrastructure. Metric targets should enable comparison with state-ofthe-art or a well-justified baseline. Offerors must state target values for each milestone and justify
why these values are challenging given the current state of the art. Proposals that do not provide
explicit, feasible, and replicable protocols to measure progress will not be considered for
award.
Successful projects must also contain the following elements:
• Developed capabilities must generalize across LLM text generation models and their different
versions.
• Delivery of ‘demonstration unit’: a containerized software (Phase A) with user interface (UI)
components and thorough documentation (Phase B). The containerized software shall be
compatible with Docker technology. An independent test and evaluation (T&E) team will
affirm that software can be successfully deployed with minimal developer effort. (Ease of
deployment will be one of the criteria for advancement into the second program phase.)
• Explicitly stated model access limitations and, where relevant, provide justification why a
particular method (e.g., black box) cannot be used.
1.3 Description of Topic Areas
The following is a list of suggested subtopics. These are intended to provide to the offeror
additional information concerning the Government’s interests in the BENGAL topic areas. These
are not considered an exhaustive list and offerors are free to propose projects which address one
or more topics/subtopics.
Topic #1 Biases and induction of diverse analytical perspectives:
Subtopics:
• Methods for objectively quantifying bias (e.g., relative to a specific collection of texts and
other content)
• Computational techniques to characterize perspective spaces and measure the differences
between perspectives.
• Using human-LLMs interactions to identify analysts’ blind spots and induce perspectives
representative of those blind spots.
• Induction of outputs representing diverse perspectives (e.g., “How would a particular group
or organization interpret this event?”)
• Deriving insights from simulated dialogue between LLMs with different
biases/perspectives
8
Topic #2 AI hallucinations and inferences:
Subtopics:
• Methods to maximize the LLM’s ability to produce valuable inferences in the absence of
ground-truth evidence.
• Novel and explainable approaches to quantifying confidence of generative model output
(e.g., to ensure trustworthiness for the user or enable generation of high-quality synthetic
training data to reduce reliance on sensitive, sparse, or noisy data sources)
• Methods to investigate theoretical bases for LLM hallucinations or grounding (e.g., are
hallucinations inevitable?)
Topic #3 Safe information flow in sensitive environments:
Subtopics:
• Targeted “unlearning” in pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., methods to remove from an
LLM: information about an individual or information derived from a particular document
deemed sensitive without otherwise affecting the performance of the model). IARPA is not
interested in filtering outputs.
• Decoupling of sensitive information: Given a description of information deemed sensitive
(e.g., source/method of collection), sanitizing a document or collection of documents such
that sensitive information or ancillary information that could be used to infer sensitive
information is verifiably removed, while retaining the meaning of the original document(s).
• Methods to identify when an aggregation of innocuous facts can be used to derive specific
sensitive information. Given a set of queries, quantify the likelihood that the user is trying
to access a particular piece of sensitive information from an LLM. Alternatively, given a
set of LLM responses, quantify the likelihood that the LLM is trying to access sensitive
information from the user.
Topic #4 Working resiliently with imperfect or poisoned sources:
Subtopics:
• LLM techniques to evaluate the reliability of a given information source (e.g., individuals
or organizations) either for the purpose of ensuring the integrity of training data or for
evaluating incoming information
• Automated and explainable techniques for inferring source intentions
• Quantifying source corroboration
• Extracting reliable intelligence from incomplete or biased content
The following topics are out of scope for this targeted super seedling effort:
• research into approaches that do not generalize across LLM text generation models and
their different versions;
• research focused on systems integration or engineering of existing approaches or
instruments;
• cybersecurity research not primarily focused on LLM technology; research that will not
result in functional prototype technology;
• approaches requiring access to classified data; and/or 
9
• research which are resubmissions of work already awarded by the National Science
Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Intelligence
Community, or other federal agencies.
1.4 Proposal Information and Structure
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be
UNCLASSIFIED. Proposals must address two independent and sequential project phases: Phase
A – Initial Proof-of-Concept (Base Period) and Phase B – Demonstration (Option Period). The
periods of performance for these phases shall not exceed 12 months for Phase A and 12 months
for Phase B. Combined Phase A and Phase B shall not exceed 24 months. Specific technical
objectives to be achieved within the topic areas listed above, task descriptions, intellectual property
rights, milestone schedule, and deliverables shall be addressed in the proposal. Detailed proposal
preparation instructions are provided in Section 4. The total award value for the combined Phase
A (Base Period) and Phase B (Option Period) shall be less than $4,000,000.
2 Award Information
2.1 General Award Information
The BAA shall result in awards for both phases of the targeted super seedling. Exercise of the
Phase B (Option Period) shall depend upon performance during Phase A (Base Period) as well as
program goals, the availability of funding, and IARPA priorities. Exercising of the Phase B option
is at the sole discretion of the Government.
Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available under this BAA shall
depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.
The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals
received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with Offerors.
The Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary.
Evaluation and award of proposals will follow FAR Part 35 processes as described herein.
Proposals selected for negotiation may result in a procurement contract.
Awards under this BAA shall be made to Offerors on the basis of the Evaluation Factors listed
herein, as well as successful completion of negotiations.
This announcement constitutes the full solicitation package. This solicitation will be conducted in
two steps:
STEP ONE – Submission of white papers. The Government will review white papers and
encourage or not encourage submission of a full proposal.
STEP TWO – A reasonable number of Offerors apparently qualified to respond to the intent of
this BAA will be encouraged to submit technical and cost proposals. Offerors not encouraged to
submit or Offerors that chose not to submit a white paper are still permitted to submit a proposal,
but may not be prioritized for review, see BAA Section 5. All proposals must be submitted by the
due date listed in Section 1 of this BAA.
See Section 4 of this announcement for further details regarding the proposal requirements.
Upon completion of evaluation, the Government will contact Offerors whose proposals are
selected for negotiations and may request additional information required for award. The 
10
Government may establish a deadline for the close of fact-finding and negotiations that allows a
reasonable time for the award of a contract. Offerors that are not responsive to Government
deadlines established and communicated with the request may be removed from award
consideration. Offerors may also be removed from award consideration should the parties fail to
reach agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms, conditions, and cost/price.
2.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Organizations may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the
BAA. However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are
selected, such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can
be paid twice to perform the same task).
3 Eligibility Information
3.1 Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses
and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit
proposals; however, no portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these organizations’
participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas for exclusive
competition among these entities. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and
Development Centers, University Affiliated Research Centers, Government-Owned, ContractorOperated facilities, Government Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization
that has a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or
proprietary information or access to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to
submit proposals under this BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by
eligible entities. An entity of which only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligible
to submit a proposal or participate as a team member subject to an organizational conflict of
interest review.
Offerors can request use of a unique facility, specialized equipment or technical service that is not
otherwise obtainable and the Government will determine if the resource can be made available to
all Offerors as Government Furnished Property/Equipment/Information Service. If the resource
requested cannot be provided directly by the Government, the Government may consider an
Offeror’s request for limited use as a procured service not otherwise available, and only after an
OCI review and determination. It is advised that the Offeror have an alternate plan in its proposal
in case the Government does not accept the proposed participation. Requests for such resources
can be submitted during the BENGAL BAA Q&A period.
3.1.1 U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or
services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the
sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or
arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate
officials of the institution.”
11
Offerors shall submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter for
each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is
serving in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their
proposal. Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g., President,
Chancellor, Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the Academic
Institution Acknowledgment Letter is enclosed in Appendix A of this BAA. Note: It is highly
recommended that this letter(s) be submitted with the Offeror’s proposal. In any case, IARPA
shall not enter into negotiations with an Offeror whose team includes a U.S. academic institution
until all required Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.
3.1.2 Foreign Entities
Foreign entities and/or individuals may participate but only as part of a U.S. based team. The
prime contractor must be a U.S. company. Foreign entities and individuals may participate as
subcontractors or employees of a U.S. company however; all foreign participation must comply
with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws and
other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances. Offerors are expected to ensure that
the efforts of foreign participants do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the
United States, nor its security interests. As such, domestic Offerors should carefully consider the
roles and responsibilities of foreign participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.
3.2 Organizational Conflicts of Interest
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” (OCI) means that because of other
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render
impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the
contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to
potential OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (subawardee,
consultant). Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each
proposal submitted pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as
applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include
a description of the actions the Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of
conflicting roles that might bias the Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an
unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI
in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits Contractors from concurrently providing Scientific Engineering
Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), or similar support
services and being a technical Contractor. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement
above, address whether an Offeror or an Offeror’s team member (e.g. subawardee, consultant) is
providing SETA, A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under: (a) a current
award or subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward.
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal must include:
The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
The prime contract number; and
Identification of proposed team member (subawardee, consultant) providing the support. 
12
As part of their proposal, Offerors shall include either (a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates
have any potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in
Appendix A.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise
selectable under the BAA Evaluation Factors.
The Government may require Offerors to provide additional information to assist the Government
in evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans.
If the Government determines that an Offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide
the affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by Government to assist in evaluating the Offeror’s OCI and proposed OCI
mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for
award.
4 Application and Submission Information
STEP ONE – White Paper Submission: Interested Offerors are encouraged to submit white
papers. White papers will be accepted until December 5, 2023, 12:00 PM EST.
The Government anticipates that Offerors will receive a response to their white paper within 15
days of submission stating whether the Government encourages a proposal or does not encourage
a proposal. The purpose of the white paper is to encourage proposals from a reasonable number
of apparently qualified sources with technical approaches/solutions of interest to the Government.

Offeror’s points of contact information including: name, email and phone number for both
technical and administrative issues.
The Proposal shall include the mandatory elements specified in sections A. through C. below.
A. Proposal Overview
• A technical overview of the proposed research and plan. Effectively and succinctly convey
the main objective, key innovations, expected impact, and other unique aspects of the
proposed research project. The overview must include a paragraph on the relevance of the
proposed research to the Intelligence Community mission, as well as a realistic timeframe
for implementation of results. This shall include a description of the key technical
challenges, a concise review of the technologies proposed to overcome these challenges
and achieve the project’s goal, and a clear statement of the novelty and uniqueness of the
proposed work are required. This section shall address in detail the following questions: 
16
What is the proposed work attempting to accomplish or do? How is it done today, and what
are the limitations? Who or what will be affected and what will be the impact if the work
is successful?
• Summary of the products, transferable technology and deliverables associated with the
proposed research results. Describe measurable deliverables that show progress toward
achieving proposed milestones and goals. (All proprietary claims to the results, prototypes,
IP, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or
demonstration shall be detailed in proposal Attachment 2, Should no proprietary claims be
identified in Attachment 2, the Government shall receive Unlimited Rights, as defined in
FAR 52.227-14, to all technology and deliverables resulting from or delivered under this
BAA.)
• Schedule and milestones for the proposed research. Summarize, in table form the schedule
and milestones for the proposed research. Do not include proprietary information with the
milestone chart. (The milestone chart may become part of the resultant contract.)
• Related research. Include a brief summary of other research in this area, comparing the
significance and plausibility of the proposed innovations against competitive approaches
to achieve proposed objectives.
• Project contributors. Include a clearly defined organizational chart of all anticipated project
participants and affiliations (e.g. subcontractor, consultant), organized under functional
roles for the effort, along with the associated task number responsibilities for each. Provide
a summary of expertise of the proposed team, including any subawardees/consultants and
key personnel who will be executing the work. Identify a principal investigator (PI) for the
project. Demonstrate that the proposed Key Personnel/Principal Investigator are
sufficiently dedicated to the project.
• Facilities. Describe the facilities and resources that will be used for the proposed effort,
including computational and experimental resources.
• Resource Share. Include the type of support, if any, the Offeror might request from the
Government, such as facilities, equipment, materials, or any such resources the Offeror is
willing to provide at no additional cost to the Government to support the research effort.
(Cost-sharing is not required from Offerors and is not an evaluation criterion but is
encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application
related to the proposed research and development effort).
• The names of other federal, state or local agencies or other parties receiving the proposal
and/or funding the proposed effort. If none, so state. Concurrent submission of the proposal
to other organizations will not prejudice its review but may impact IARPA’s decision to
fund the effort.
B. Statement of Work (SOW)

• Attachment 6: Privacy Plan (if applicable)
• Attachment 7: Quad Chart Summary of Proposal
4.2.2 Volume 2: Cost/Price Proposal (No page Limit)
IARPA anticipates awarding Cost type procurement contracts. However, Offerors may request
other than a Cost type procurement contract (e.g. FFP, cost-share).
Regardless of the type of contract, the Offeror’s cost/price proposal shall contain sufficient
supporting information to establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project, the perception of
project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to support the realism and
reasonableness of the proposed cost/price, to the extent appropriate.
Offerors shall provide the detailed cost supporting information addressed below and in the Volume
2 Cost Element Spreadsheet, Appendix A.
Offerors may submit alternative cost/price supporting information or information in a different
format; however, this will be subject to a CO determination of acceptability. If alternative
information and formatting are not found acceptable, the CO will request the Offeror provide
appropriate cost supporting information during negotiations. Examples where alternative
cost/price supporting information and formatting may be found acceptable are when submitted by 
18
non-traditional contractors such as commercial entities that do not typically accept FAR-based
contracts, small businesses, start-up companies or foreign companies.
The Cost/Price Volume shall include the following:
A. Cost Element Breakdown and Total Cost Summary
Offerors shall submit an Excel document, in the format provided in Appendix A. It shall include
intact formulas and shall not be hard numbered. The base and option period cost data should roll
up into a total cost summary. The Excel files may be write-protected but shall not be password
protected.
• Completed cost element breakdown for the base period, option period and the total project
summary in the format provided in Appendix A.
• Total costs broken down by major task.
B. Narrative Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient
detail to substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the basis of estimate
(BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable:
Direct Labor –Describe the basis of the proposed labor categories and rates and provide a copy of
the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) with the Government. If Offerors do not
have a current FPRA with the Government, provide payroll records or contingency hire letters
with salary data to support each proposed labor category, including those for key individuals, and
the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal Submission, if applicable. Offeror should also
address whether any portion of their labor rates is attributable to uncompensated overtime.
Labor Escalation Factor – State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g., based
upon Global Insight indices, Cost Index or historical data). If the escalation rate is based upon
historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample calculation
demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor.
Subcontracts (to include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs) – The Offeror is
responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume.
Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, option period and the
total summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Appendix A).
Consultant letter(s) of commitment shall also be attached.
Information shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided in
Appendix A. The Offeror shall also provide justification for why the subcontractor was selected
and its determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable (Reference FAR Part 44 and FAR
clause 52.244-2). If subcontractors have concerns about proprietary cost information,
subcontractors can submit their detailed cost proposal information directly to the CO during
negotiations.
Materials and Equipment – Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data or any other
information including Offeror’s analysis to support proposed costs.
Travel - The proposed travel supporting detail shall include destination and purpose of the trip,
number of trips, number of travelers, days per trip and cost/price per traveler in sufficient detail to
19
verify the BOE and determine reasonableness. Limited travel is anticipated; however, the
proposed travel costs should align with the key activities reflected in the Figure 1 of the
BAA. Kickoff/PI meetings will require in-person attendance of relevant personnel in the
Washington DC metropolitan area. Additionally, Offerors may propose travel costs to/from team
member sites, as needed to facilitate government site visits and/or as necessary in the performance
of the research project. Proposed travel costs shall comply with the limitations set forth in FAR
Part 31.
Conference travel will require prior approval from the Contracting Officer under any contract
resulting from this BAA.
Other Direct Costs (ODCs) – ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes, historical
data or any other information including the Offeror’s analysis.
Indirect Costs – The Offeror shall show indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect
rate by fiscal year and period (base, option) and provide information on indirect cost pools and
allocation bases for each year and program period involved. If a Government agency recently
audited the Offeror’s indirect rates, the Offeror shall identify the agency that conducted the audit,
when the rates were approved and the period for which they are effective. Include a copy of this
rate agreement. Absent current Government rate recommendations, it is incumbent on the Offeror
to provide some other means of demonstrating indirect rate realism (e.g., 3 years of historical
actual costs with applicable pools and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly from historical
experience, the Offeror shall explain of the variance.
Cost sharing – Describe the source, nature and amount of cost-sharing, if any. (Acceptable forms
of cost share include (but may not be limited to): Cash contributions (application of discretionary
resources) from prime Offeror and/or subcontractor(s); unreimbursed labor; materials and
equipment; use of materials or equipment for program duration (lease value equivalent); and IP
with established market value. Non- acceptable forms of cost share include (but may not be limited
to): foregone fee; foregone G&A and COM if using independent research and development
(IR&D) as cost share; valuation of IP with no established market value; facilities or other assets
accounted for in overhead rates applied to labor; and capital assets without clear and direct
contribution to the program.)
Other Pricing and Assumptions – Identify all pricing assumptions, that should be considered or
incorporated into the resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished
Property/Facilities/Information, access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.).
Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM) – If proposing FCCM, the Offeror shall show FCCM
cost calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and program year
and provide a copy of the Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA), Forward Price Rate System
(FPRS) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR), if available.
Profit/Fee - Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base. Provide
justification for your proposed profit or fee.
Systems - For the systems listed below, provide a brief description of the cognizant federal agency
and audit results. If the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short narrative
describing the steps your organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the current status.
If a formal audit has been performed by a Government Agency, please provide a complete copy
of the audit report or adequacy determination letter. If the system has never received a formal 
20
Government review and approval include a statement to that effect. Address whether your
organization has contracts that are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered and if so, whether
they are subject to full or modified CAS coverage.
• Accounting system (if proposing a cost reimbursement contract)
• Purchasing System
4.3 White Paper and Proposal Submission Information
White papers and proposals shall be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and
Evaluation System (IDEAS). Offerors interested in providing a submission in response to this
BAA shall first register by electronic means in accordance with the instructions provided on the
following web site: https://iarpa-ideas.gov. Offerors are strongly encouraged to register a few
days prior to the due date (allow at least a week after BAA is posted). Offerors who do not register
in advance do so at their own risk, and IARPA shall not extend the due date to accommodate such
Offerors. Failure to register as stated shall prevent the Offeror’s submittal of documents.
After registration has been approved, Offerors should upload a white paper or proposal, in ‘pdf’
format, or as otherwise directed (Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Offerors are responsible for ensuring
compliant and timely submissions. Time management to upload and submit is wholly the
responsibility of the Offeror. The submittal due date and time for white papers is December 5,
2023 at 12:00 PM EST. The submittal due date and time for proposals is February 9, 2024 at
4:00 PM EST.
Upon completing the white paper or proposal submission, the Offeror shall receive an automated
confirmation email from IDEAS. IARPA strongly suggests that the Offeror document the
submission of their white paper or proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and
date stamped) that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a white paper or
proposal to the IDEAS website.
Should an Offeror be unable to complete the electronic submittal, the Offeror shall employ the
following procedure. The Offeror shall send an e-mail dni-IARPA-BAA-24-03@iarpa.gov, prior
to the due date and time specified in the BAA and indicate that an attempt was made to submit
electronically and that the submittal was unsuccessful. This e-mail shall include contact
information for the Offeror. Upon receipt of such notification, the Government will provide
additional guidance regarding submission. White papers or proposals submitted by any means
other than IDEAS shall not be considered unless the Offeror notified the Government of its
unsuccessful attempted electronic submittal and complied with the Government’s subsequent
guidance regarding submission.
It is in IARPA’s sole discretion whether to call for a second round of proposals. Selection of any
subsequent rounds remains contingent on the technical and funding availability evaluation factors.
Submissions received after the due date and time are deemed to be late and may not be reviewed.
Failure to comply with the submission procedures may result in the submittal not being evaluated.
Although classified proposals are not anticipated for this program, if an Offeror chooses to submit
a classified white paper or proposal, the Offeror must first contact IARPA via dni-IARPA-BAA24-03@iarpa.gov and request detailed submittal instructions. The Government reserves the right
not to accept classified proposals or supporting information. In no case shall classified information
be uploaded into IDEAS.
21
Regarding proprietary markings, Offerors are responsible for clearly identifying proprietary
information. Submissions containing proprietary information must have the cover page and each
page containing such information clearly marked with a label such as “Proprietary.” NOTE:
“Confidential” is a classification marking used to control the dissemination of U.S. Government
National Security Information and should not be used to identify proprietary business information.
See BAA Section 6.2.1 for additional information on Proprietary Data.
5 Evaluation of White Papers/Proposals
White papers will be reviewed by Government Technical expert (s) to determine a reasonable
number of Offerors apparently qualified to meet the intent of the BAA. This determination will
be based on the Offeror presenting technical qualifications specific to the field of science and
technology needed for the technical approach/solution presented, and the Government’s interest
in the Offeror’s intended technical approach/solution. Program balance across Topics and/or
program budget constraints may also be considerations in determining a reasonable number of
Offerors encouraged to submit. (It is IARPA’s intent to encourage approximately 50 proposals).
The submission window for the white papers will open on December 1, 2023 12:00 PM EST
and close on December 5, 2023 12:00 PM EST. The Government will conduct a review of white
papers. All efforts will be made to provide a response within 15 days of the due date.
Based on the above determination, Offerors will either be encouraged to submit a proposal or not
encouraged to submit a proposal. Note: Offerors that did not submit a white paper and offerors
that submitted a white paper but were not encouraged to submit a proposal, may still submit a
proposal but may not be given the same priority as offerors that were encouraged to submit, see
5.3 below.
Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their
proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
Proposals:
Proposals will be evaluated under FAR Part 35 procedures as described below.
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this BAA are described in the
following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be evaluated on its
own merits and its relevance to the BAA goals rather than against other proposals submitted in
response to this BAA.
The proposals shall be evaluated on the basis of technical evaluation and funding availability
factors. The technical evaluation and funding availability factors are of equal importance. Within
the technical evaluation factor, the specific technical criteria are in descending order of importance,
as follows: Overall Scientific and Technical Merit and Potential Contribution and Relevance to the
IARPA Mission. Within the funding availability factor, the sub criteria are of equal importance.
Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided below.
Awards will be made on the basis of the technical evaluation and funding availability factors, and
subject to successful negotiations with the Government. Award shall not be made to Offeror(s)
whose proposal(s) are determined not to be selectable.
Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their
proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance. 
22
5.1 Technical Evaluation Factor (sub criteria are in descending order of importance)
Proposals will be evaluated using the following two technical criteria, listed in descending order
of importance:
A. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Evaluators will assess the extent to which:
- The proposed technical approach is novel, innovative, feasible, achievable, and complete.
- The proposed technical team has the expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed
tasks and is sufficiently dedicated to the project.
- Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical
sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final outcome that
achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award.
- The proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly
defined and feasible.
B. Potential Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission
Evaluators will also assess the potential contributions of the proposed effort to bolster the national
security technology base, and support IARPA’s mission to make pivotal early technology
investments that create or prevent technological surprise. Additionally, evaluators will assess the
extent to which the proposed intellectual property restrictions (if any) will impact the
Government’s ability to utilize and transition the technology to partners.
5.2 Funding Availability Factor (sub criteria are of equal importance)
A. Budget Constraints
The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting the BAA objectives within
budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts. Note: If the Offeror has
submitted the proposal to other federal, state or local agencies or other parties that may fund the
proposed effort, this may impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort.
B. Program Balance
The Government will take into account IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives to ensure
a balanced approach to achieving program goals. This may include, but is not limited to,
broadening the variety of technical approaches and developing capabilities aligned with IC
priorities.
5.3 Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of IARPA to ensure impartial, equitable and comprehensive proposal evaluations.
The Government anticipates more than one award. Additionally, the Government is not required
to review proposals beyond those that were encouraged during the white paper stage. Given the
Government’s limited resources, the Government, at its sole discretion, may prioritize proposals
in the following order: 1) proposals that were encouraged by the Government during the white
paper stage, 2) proposals for which a white paper was not submitted; and 3) proposals that were 
23
not encouraged during the white paper stage. If the Government elects to review proposals for
which a white paper was not submitted or that were not encouraged during the white paper stage,
the Government may further prioritize based on program balance. IARPA may discontinue
evaluating proposals due to budget constraints. If new funds become available, prior to proposal
expiration, IARPA may restart proposal evaluations and issue additional selections/awards.
Selection for negotiation will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process. A
Scientific Review Panel (SRP) consisting of qualified Government Reviewers, will be established.
Reviewer(s) will assess proposal strengths, weaknesses, and risks1
against the technical criteria. If
necessary, non-Government technical experts with specialized expertise may advise the
Reviewer(s). However, only Government personnel will make recommendations and selection
determinations under this BAA. When the review is completed, the Reviewer(s) will provide their
findings and technical recommendations to the Program Manager. The Program Manager will
conduct an independent review and consider the findings and recommendations of the Reviewer(s)
and prepare a Recommendation of Selection Memo, based on all Evaluation Factors (Technical
Evaluation Factor and Funding Availability Factor), to the Scientific Review Official (SRO).
The SRO will make the final decision as to selectability for negotiations based on all stated
Evaluation Factors. At this point, Offerors will be notified in writing as to whether they have been
determined selectable, or not selectable. For the purposes of this proposal evaluation process,
these terms are defined as follows:
Selectable: A selectable proposal is a proposal that has been evaluated by the Government against
the evaluation factors listed in the BAA, and determined to be technically strong, aligned to
IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives, and funding is available. The technical strengths
of the proposal outweigh any technical weaknesses and risks and/or the proposal appreciably
contributes to program balance. Additionally, there are no technical weaknesses that would require
other than minor modification. The proposal can now move to the negotiation and award process.
Non-Selectable: A proposal is considered non-selectable when the proposal has been evaluated by
the Government against the evaluation factors listed in the BAA and determined to be technically
weak and/or not aligned with IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives, proposal
weaknesses are not offset by strengths, and/or it does not contribute to program balance.
(Proposals that were not evaluated due to limited resources, prioritization and/or budget
constraints, as described above, will also be considered non-selectable.)
Contract award is contingent on CO determination of a fair and reasonable cost/price and contract
agreement on terms and conditions.
5.4 Negotiation and Award
After selection and before award, the CO will contact Offerors whose proposals were determined
selectable to engage in negotiations. The CO will review the cost/price proposal using the proposal
analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1, as appropriate, to determine a fair and reasonable
cost/price. The CO’s evaluation will include review of proposed anticipated costs/prices of the
1
Strength- An aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has appreciable merit or appreciably exceeds specified performance or capability requirements
in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance.
Weakness – A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
Risk - The potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an Offeror’s proposed
approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance,
the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.
24
Offeror and proposed subcontractors, to ensure the Offeror has fully analyzed the budget
requirements, provided sufficient supporting information, has adequate systems for managing the
contract (i.e., accounting, purchasing as applicable), and that data is traceable and reconcilable.
The CO’s evaluation will also determine whether the prospective contractor understands the
project and its risks and has the ability to organize and perform the work and that, the Offeror
meets the responsibility standards of FAR 9.104. Additional information and supporting data may
be requested.
Procurement contracts shall be awarded to those Offerors on the basis of all stated Evaluation
Factors, and pending the successful conclusion of negotiations.
5.5 Proposal Retention
Proposals shall not be returned upon completion of the source selection process. The original of
each proposal received shall be retained at IARPA and all other non-required copies shall be
destroyed. A certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal request is sent
to IARPA via e-mail to dni-IARPA-BAA-24-03@iarpa.gov within 5 days after notification of
proposal results.
6 Award Administration Information
6.1 Award Notices
As soon as practicable after the evaluation of a proposal is complete, the Offeror will be notified
that: (1) its proposal has been selected for negotiations, or (2) its proposal has not been selected
for negotiations.
6.2 Administrative and National Policy Requirements
6.2.1 Proprietary Data
IARPA treats all proposals as proprietary information and will disclose their contents only for the
purpose of evaluation. All proposals containing proprietary data shall have the cover page and
each page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. It is the
Offeror’s responsibility to clearly define to the Government what the Offeror considers proprietary
data.
For the purposes of this BAA proposal evaluation, proprietary information is “contractor bid or
proposal information” as describe in FAR 3.104-1. Contractor bid or proposal information means
any of the following information submitted to a Federal agency as part of or in connection with a
bid or proposal to enter into a Federal agency procurement contract, if that information has not
been previously made available to the public or disclosed publicly:
(1) Cost or pricing data (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2306a.(h)) with respect to procurements subject
to that section, and 41 U.S.C. 3501(a)(2), with respect to procurements subject to that section.
(2) Indirect costs and direct labor rates.
(3) Proprietary information about manufacturing processes, operations, or techniques marked by
the contractor in accordance with applicable law or regulation.
(4) Information marked by the contractor as “contractor bid or proposal information” in accordance
with applicable law or regulation. 
25
(5) Information marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e).
6.2.2 Intellectual Property
General. The Government may request additional information from the Offeror, as may be
necessary, to evaluate the Offeror’s IP rights assertions. If Offerors do not identify any restrictions
with respect to the proposed deliverables, the Government shall assume in its review of the
proposal that the Government will receive Unlimited Rights in accordance with FAR 52.227-11.
Further, failure to provide complete information may result in a determination that the proposal is
not compliant with the solicitation, and the Government reserves the right to reject a proposal if
the Offeror does not appropriately address all required IP rights issues.
IP Ownership. The Government’s rights will be in accordance with the resulting contract which
will include but may not be limited to FAR 52.227-11, 52.227-14, 52.227-16 and IA52.227-702.
Regardless of the scope of the Government’s rights, Offerors receiving contracts under this BAA
may freely use IP generated under the contract for their own commercial purposes unless restricted
by U.S. export control laws or security classification. Therefore, technical data and computer
software developed under any contract resulting from this solicitation will remain the property of
the Contractor, subject to IARPA’s rights as set forth in the contract. For inventions first conceived
or actually reduced to practice under this effort, Contractor shall grant the Government a
nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on
its behalf, such invention throughout the world; Contractor may elect to retain title as described in
the award instrument.
Indemnification. Offerors/Contractors expecting to use, but not to deliver, data or patentable
inventions, including commercial open-source tools in implementing their approach shall be
required to indemnify the Government against legal liability arising from such use.
Technical Data--Withholding of Payment. If technical data specified to be delivered under a
contract awarded under this solicitation are not delivered within the time specified by the contract
or are deficient upon delivery (including having restrictive markings not specifically authorized
by the contract), the CO is permitted, until such data are accepted by the Government, to withhold
payment to the contractor of ten percent (10%) of the total contract price or amount unless a lesser
withholding is specified in the contract. Payments may not be withheld, nor any other action taken
pursuant to this paragraph when the contractor's failure to make timely delivery or to deliver such
data without deficiencies arises out of causes beyond its control and without fault or negligence of
the contractor. The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the contractor shall not
be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government under the contract.
6.2.3 Human Use
All research involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human data,
selected for funding must comply with the federal regulations for human subject protection, namely 45 CFR
Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects.
Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a
current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance
(http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp). All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors,
must also have a valid Assurance. In addition to a local IRB approval, IARPA will review and approve the
HSR documentation before HSR may begin. However, IARPA does not require a secondary review by a
Government IRB. 
26
For all proposed research that will involve human subjects, the institution must provide evidence of or a
plan for review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) with the final proposal submission to IARPA as
outlined in Section 4 of the BAA. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the
institution’s Assurance. The informed consent document must comply with federal regulations (45 CFR
Part 46).
The amount of time required to complete the IRB review/approval process may vary depending on the
complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants. Ample time should be allotted to
complete the approval process. No IARPA funding can be used towards human subject research until ALL
approvals are granted.
In limited instances, human subject research may be exempt from Federal regulations for human subject
protection, for example, under Department of Health and Human Services, 45 CFR 46.101(b). Offerors
claiming that their research falls within an exemption from Federal regulations for human subject protection
must provide written documentation with their proposal that cites the specific applicable exemption and
explains clearly how their proposed research fits within that exemption.
6.2.4 RESERVED
6.2.5 Publication Approval
It is anticipated that research funded under this Program shall be unclassified research that shall
not require a pre-publication review. However, Offerors should note that pre-publication approval
of certain information may be required if it is determined that its release may result in the
disclosure of sensitive intelligence information. A courtesy soft copy of any work submitted for
publication shall be provided to the IARPA PM and the Contracting Officer’s Technical
Representative (COTR) a minimum of 5 days prior to release in any forum.
6.2.6 Export Control
(1) The Offeror shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 through 130, and the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 through 799, as amended, in the
performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the
Offeror shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required,
for exports of (including deemed exports) hardware, technical data, and software, or for the
provision of technical assistance.
(2) The Offeror shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing
non-U.S. persons (as defined in the ITAR and EAR, as applicable) in the performance of this
contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at any Government
installation (whether in or outside the United States), where the foreign person shall have access
to export-controlled technologies, including technical data or software.
(3) The Offeror shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated
with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.
(4) The Offeror shall appropriately mark all contract deliverables controlled by ITAR and/or
EAR.
(5) The Offeror shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this section apply to its
sub-contractors.
27
(6) The Offeror may be required to certify knowledge of and intended adherence to these
requirements in the representations and certifications of the contract.
6.2.7 Subcontracting
It is the policy of the Government to enable small business and small disadvantaged business
concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering
services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts and to assure that
prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Each Offeror that is selected for
negotiation for award and is expected to be awarded a contract which exceeds the simplified
acquisition threshold may be asked to submit a Subcontracting Plan before award in accordance
with FAR 19.702(a) (1). The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704.
Offerors shall declare teaming relationships in their Technical and Cost proposals and shall specify
the type of teaming arrangement in place, including any exclusive teaming arrangements. IARPA
neither promotes nor discourages the establishment of exclusive teaming agreements within
Proposer teams. Individuals or organizations associated with multiple teams shall take care not to
over-commit those resources being applied.
6.2.8 Reporting
Fiscal and management responsibility are important to the Government. Although the number and
types of reports shall be specified in the award document, all Offerors shall, at a minimum, provide
the CO, Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and PM with monthly technical
status reports, monthly financial status reports and final reports. The reports shall be prepared and
submitted in accordance with the procedures contained in the award document and mutually agreed
upon before award. Technical reports shall describe technical highlights and accomplishments,
priorities and plans, issues and concerns, evaluation results, and future plans. Financial reports
shall present an on-going financial profile of the project, including total project funding, funds
invoiced, funds received, funds expended during the preceding month, and planned expenditures
over the remaining period (financial report format may be modified for FFP contracts). Additional
reports and briefing material may also be required, as appropriate, to document progress in
accomplishing program metrics.
Reports shall be delivered to the CO, COTR and the PM.
6.2.9 System for Award Management (SAM)
Selected Offerors are required to register in the Systems for Award Management (SAM) prior to
any award under this BAA. Information on SAM registration is available at http://www.sam.gov.
6.2.10 Representations and Certifications
Selected Offerors are required to complete electronic representations and certifications at
http://www.sam.gov and may also be required to complete additional representations and
certifications prior to award.
6.2.11 Lawful Use and Privacy Protection Measures
All data gathered by the Offeror shall be obtained in accordance with U.S. laws and in compliance
with the End User License Agreement, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies
regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Before using such data, the Offeror shall provide
proof that the data was acquired in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations.
28
6.2.12 Public Access to Results
IARPA is committed to making the results of this research available and maximally useful to the
public, industry, government, and the scientific community, in accordance with the policy set forth
in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s memorandum “Increasing Access
to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research,” dated February 22, 2013, consistent with
all other applicable law and policy; agency mission; resource constraints; and U.S. national,
homeland, and economic security.
(https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_me
mo_2013.pdf)
Upon acceptance for publication of any manuscript or paper reporting results of work under a
contract awarded pursuant to this BAA, the author’s final peer-reviewed manuscript(s) or
conference paper(s) must be submitted to the IARPA-designated repository for public access, in
accordance with the instructions on IARPA’s website at http://www.iarpa.gov. The Government
will make the Publication available to the public through the repository at no charge, following a
one-year embargo to preserve the rights of the publisher. The author must inform the publisher of
rights that will be retained by the author and IARPA by including in the publishing/transfer of
copyright agreement a provision substantially as follows:
“Journal acknowledges that Author retains the right to provide a copy of the final peer-reviewed
manuscript (“Work”) to the Federal agency funding the research on which the Work is based upon
acceptance for Journal publication, for public archiving as soon as possible but no later than 12
months after publication by Journal. Journal further acknowledges that the Federal Government,
having funded the research upon which the Work is based, has certain irrevocable and nonexclusive contractual rights in the Work, which are not affected or altered in any way by this
Agreement.”
Additionally, awardee must deposit the data underlying the results and findings in the publication
in a suitable public repository, in accordance with the project’s Data Management Plan. If the
metadata describing the underlying or supporting research data is not included in the Publication,
the awardee must provide the metadata to the IARPA-designated public access repository, in
accordance with the instructions on IARPA’s website at http://www.iarpa.gov.
IARPA will accept a final published article in lieu of a final peer-reviewed manuscript, provided
the author has the right to provide the article and authorize IARPA to release the article publicly.
Data produced under the program, reports to IARPA, and program-related publications should be
consistent with the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines of the Center for Open
Science, including preregistration of studies and analysis plans. (https://cos.io/our-services/topguidelines/). To the extent possible, all reports to IARPA and all program-related publications
should be consistent with statistical best practices described in (Psychological Science (2014)
http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/3). For example, wherever appropriate, effect sizes and
confidence intervals (or the Bayesian equivalents) should be reported, and the data and
methodology must be presented so that it is easily used for meta-analysis and independent reanalysis of the data. All Offerors must describe plans to ensure that the above requirements are
satisfied.
29
6.2.13 Cloud Compatibility
Software deliverables must be deployable to cloud platforms for testing and must be approvable
for production use in the cloud. Technical approaches should generally avoid the following:
requiring high-performance, special-purpose, or excessive quantities of virtual hardware not
readily available in the cloud; requiring an obscure operating system, middleware, or plug-in code
not readily available for use in the cloud or on the desktops used to access the cloud; leveraging
inherently risky protocols, e.g., Telnet, or software packages, e.g., FOCI-relevant; or including
custom code that is not inspectable by Information System Security professionals.

G.3 IA52.232-700 BILLING CYCLE (JUL 2013)
Pursuant to the "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests Using IPP" clause, IA52.232-700, the
Government will issue payment only after services have been rendered. Consequently, Contractors
shall submit invoices in arrears and no more frequently than monthly.
G.4 IA52.232-701 ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS USING IPP
(JUN 2021)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause –
(1)"Contract financing payment" and "invoice payment" have the meanings given in
FAR section 32.001.
(2) "Electronic form" means using the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) to transmit information
electronically from the Contractor to the internal contract management system. IARPA does
not consider facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents to be electronic forms.
(3) "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment
submitted by the Contractor under a contract.
(b) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence currently uses the CIA’s payment system, the
Invoice Processing Platform (IPP). Therefore, except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this
clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests using the IPP. When accessing IPP, the CIA’s 
48
name will be the designated organization, not the ODNI. The payment period designated by the
Prompt Payment Act will begin on the date a proper and complete invoice is received in the payment
office via IPP. The status of submitted invoices is available in IPP. For other invoice or payment
questions relating directly to this contract, call the payment office on 703-613-3530.
(c) The Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) and associated CLIN descriptions as provided in IPP must
be utilized to create invoices. An Invoice Line Item Number must reference the Contract Line Item
Number (CLIN) against which the Contractor is billing. An invoice may have multiple Invoice
Lines billing against one CLIN, but the Invoice Line Item Descriptions must closely related to the
CLIN descriptions in the contract. For Material Line Item CLINS, the vendor must match the “Unit
Price” to the penny on the referenced CLIN or the invoice will be rejected. Do not attach any
documents to the invoice submitted in IPP as the attachments will be discarded. Any additional
documentation must be submitted to the COTR in a method mutually agreed to by the Contractor
and the COTR.
(d) In addition to the IPP required data, all payment requests, other than Firm fixed Price, shall require
supporting documentation in order to be considered a proper and complete invoice. Supporting
documentation consists of the following:
(1) The following information for CLINs:
i. For a cost-reimbursement CLIN: Information separated by major cost
elements – Direct Costs, e.g., labor categories/hours/rates, direct material,
subcontracts, travel, other direct costs; Indirect Costs, e.g., overhead, G&A;
and Fee (if applicable), along with supporting documentation;
ii. For a time-and-materials CLIN: Information separated by labor categories,
labor hours, fixed hourly rates, materials as defined in FAR 16.601(a), and
applicable material handling costs; and
iii. For a labor-hour CLIN: Information separated by labor categories, labor
hours, and fixed hourly rates.
(2) Monthly Contract Status Report (due when IPP Invoice is submitted). NOTE: The
period and amount reported in the Monthly Contract Status Report shall reflect
the same period and amount reported in the invoice submitted to IPP.
(3) Detailed Invoice (due when IPP Invoice is submitted), NOTE: The period and
amount reported in the invoice submitted to IPP shall reflect the same period and
amount reported in the Monthly Contract Status Report.
(4) Any other necessary documentation to provide substantiation of costs invoiced, to
include any supporting information related to a discrepancy between the amount
invoiced and amount of the Monthly Contract Status Report. (Due no later than 10
days after close of invoicing period).
These documents shall be emailed directly to the Contracting Officer and COTR as
IPP does not have the capability for attachments.
(e) The Invoice shall not include any sensitive and/or classified information, nor identify the Sponsor or
any of its facilities. Any invoices including sensitive and/or classified information will not be
considered a proper invoice in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act and will be rejected. Further,
the submission of such an invoice may be considered a security incident and will be forwarded for
investigation. Any questions concerning this matter should be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(f) If the Contractor is unable to submit a payment request in electronic form, or the Agency is unable to
49
receive a payment request in electronic form, the Contractor shall submit the payment request using a
method mutually agreed to by the Contractor, the Contracting Officer, and the payment office.
(g) In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the
appropriate payment clauses in this contract when submitting payment requests.
(h) The Contractor shall submit the final invoice or voucher for cost reimbursement contracts in
accordance with the “Contract Settlement Documentation” clause of this contract.
G.5 IA52.232-702 INVOICE PROCESSING PLATFORM INITIAL REGISTRATION AND
ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE (OCT 2019)
(a) The Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) is a secure, web-based electronic invoicing system (accessible
via the Internet) provided by the Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS),
in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Contractor shall provide the
Contracting Officer with the following information required for IPP registration:
(1) Company Name (primary corporate location).
(2) Company Tax Identification Number (TIN); and
(3) Company designated IPP account administrator, to include: name, position, phone number,
and e-mail address
Contractors currently registered with IPP through another Government agency do not need to register
again in IPP, but must still register separately through the Agency’s Contracting Officer for payments
from this Agency.
(b) Within 1-2 weeks after the contract is signed, the information provided in paragraph (a) will be
forwarded to IPP and the company designated IPP account administrator will then receive two emails from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRB St. Louis) e-mail address
STLS.ipphelpdesk@stls.frb.org.
(1) From "IPP User Administration" - the Company's IPP User ID, a link to the IPP Application,
and the IPP Helpdesk phone number.
(2) From "Treasury UPS User Administration" - the Company's IPP password (sent within 24
hours of the first email).
(c) During registration, one (1) initial administrative user account is created for the company for the
submitted TIN, regardless of the number of contracts or locations associated with the TIN. The IPP
account administrator is required to set up all other company user accounts, including other
administrators. Registration is complete when the IPP account administrator logs into the IPP
website with the User ID and password provided by FRB St. Louis and accepts the "rules of
behavior".
(d) The Contractor shall access a first-time login video found on the IPP homepage, which provides
step-by-step instructions for logging into IPP for the first time. Other self-help videos, to include
creating and submitting invoices, are available only after logging into IPP.
(e) Passwords in IPP expire every 180 days. Fourteen days prior to the end of the 180-day period, IPP 
50
will send an e-mail notification prompting you to change your password. If you do not change your
password once during the 180 days, or if you do not change your password when prompted to do so,
you must contact the IPP Helpdesk at 1-866-973-3131 to unlock your account and to reset your
password.
(f) IPP requires that all contractors re-certify annually. Failure to recertify will result in their accounts
being disabled. Recertification requests are sent by e-mail to the address designated as the IPP
account administrator for the contractor. The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that any
information requested by IPP for the purposes of recertification is provided to IPP within the
timeframe designated in the correspondence. If the contractor has any questions about the
recertification process or if their account becomes disabled, the contractor shall contact the IPP Help
Desk at 1-866-973-3131 for assistance.
(g) When entering invoice description fields into IPP, the contractor shall not use classified and/or
sensitive words and phrases in any portions of their submitted invoices. The Agency has sole
discretion on what constitutes a classified and/or sensitive word or phrase. Failure to follow this
direction will result in the Agency rejecting any invoices containing such words as invalid. The
contractor shall consult with the Contracting Officer and the Vendor Service Center for clarifications
on questionable words and phrases.
(h) For application specific questions such as how to create an invoice or how to set up notifications,
contact the IPP Helpdesk at 1-866-973-3131. For questions related to the contract, contact the
Contracting Officer.

accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3512 and 31 U.S.C. 3515, Federal Accounting Standards,
and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructions. Because Contractors 
53
maintain the custodial records for Government assets in their possession, the
Government must periodically obtain data from those records to complete its financial
reports. Changes in Federal Accounting Standards and OMB reporting requirements
may occur from year to year, requiring Contractor submission of supplemental
information. The specific Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards
(SFFAS) to be used for property records are SFFAS No. 3 "Accounting for Inventory
and Related Property," SFFAS No. 6, "Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment
(PP&E)", and SFFAS No. 11, "Amendments to PP&E: Definitional Changes" issued
by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board.
(c) Submitting Quarterly Financial Reports: The Contractor's property control system shall
record and report the total acquisition cost of CAP for which the Contractor is
accountable under this contract. The Contractor shall submit Quarterly Financial
Reports, as a Microsoft Excel document, to the Government Property Administrator at
the address indicated in clause IA52.245-714, Government Property, in accordance
with the detailed instructions set forth in the Section J attachment entitled "Quarterly
Financial Reporting Requirements for Contractor Acquired Property (CAP)."
(d) Property Disposition Report: The Contractor shall include in its Quarterly Financial
Reports all applicable disposition (e.g. returned, transferred, abandoned in place) of
Government Property reported as Contractor Acquired or Contractor Fabricated
Property on a previous Quarterly Financial Report. The Contractor shall maintain a
copy of supporting documentation for all applicable dispositions of CAP in the
quarterly reporting period following a change in CAP status. At a minimum,
documentation shall support the date, reason, and authorization for each change in CAP
status.
(e) Documentation Required to Support Contractor Acquired Property Assets: The
Contractor shall maintain a copy of all documentation to support the reported total
acquisition cost and acquisition date/date placed in service for all CAP valued at
$50,000 and above on the first quarterly reporting period following the date purchased
or upon completion and acceptance by the Government of Contractor fabricated assets.
Contractor fabricated assets should only be reported once completed, accepted by the
Government and only if delivered in place. Contractor fabricated assets delivered to
the Government shall be the responsibility of the Government for inclusion into
financial reporting. All CAP purchases since the last submitted quarterly financial
report must be reported on the next quarterly financial report. Total acquisition cost
includes all costs incurred to bring the CAP to the form and location of its intended
use. This might include cost such as materials, labor, overhead, shipping, inspection,
testing, etc. Support documentation would normally include purchase orders and/or
invoices detailing items and cost.
(f) (U) Subject to Audit: The Contractor is required to maintain accurate and complete
supporting documentation for all assets reported on the Quarterly Financial Report for
the life of the asset or the duration of the contract, whichever comes first. This
documentation, verification, and condition of the assets are subject to audit by the
Government.
G.10 IA52.249-700 NO COST SETTLEMENT (JUN 2017)
When in the best interest of the Government and Contractor, a no-cost settlement may be executed in lieu
of a termination due to uncertainties involved in contract performance in Research and Development 
54
efforts. In a no-cost settlement, all costs reimbursable, not previously paid, for the performance of the
contract to the date of the termination are allowable; however, the costs for anticipatory profits or
consequential damages resulting from the termination of this contract (or any subcontract) to include:
accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses necessary for the preparation of settlement proposals and
supporting data shall be excluded from the settlement proposal submitted by the contractor. The rights
and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided
by law under this contract. The termination/cancellation ceiling is limited to the available funding
obligated on the contract. This statement is made part of Schedule B.
