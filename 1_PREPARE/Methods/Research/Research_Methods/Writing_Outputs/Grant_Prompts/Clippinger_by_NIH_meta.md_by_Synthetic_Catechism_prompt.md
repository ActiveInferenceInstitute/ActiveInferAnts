        # National Institutes of Health (NIH): A Comprehensive Overview

## History and Mission

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, stands as the nation's premier medical research agency. Its journey began in 1887 as a modest one-room Laboratory of Hygiene at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island, New York. Today, the NIH has evolved into one of the world's foremost centers for medical research and innovation.

The NIH's mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. This mission is realized through:

1. Conducting and supporting cutting-edge medical and behavioral research
2. Investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases
3. Fostering innovative research strategies and their applications
4. Developing, maintaining, and renewing scientific resources
5. Promoting the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in research conduct

## Strategic Goals

The NIH pursues four overarching goals:

1. Advance opportunities in biomedical research
2. Foster innovation by setting NIH priorities
3. Enhance scientific stewardship
4. Excel as a federal science agency by managing for results

## Organization and Structure

The NIH comprises 27 Institutes and Centers, each with a specific research agenda often focusing on particular diseases or body systems. The Office of the Director (OD) serves as the central office, responsible for setting policy and planning, managing, and coordinating the programs and activities of all NIH components.

### Key Components of NIH:

1. Office of the Director (OD)
