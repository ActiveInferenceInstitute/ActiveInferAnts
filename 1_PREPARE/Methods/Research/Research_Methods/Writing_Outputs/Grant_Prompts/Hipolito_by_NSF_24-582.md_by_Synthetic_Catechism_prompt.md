Inês Hipólito ~ Active Inference Insights 004 ~ Markov Blankets, Modularity, Enactivism

welcome everybody to the fourth episode of active inference insights I'm your host Daris Pary Wayne and today I have
the pleasure of Hosting inz hippolito inz is a lecture of philosophy of artificial intelligence and mqu
University in Australia our research focuses on 4E cognition which holds that cognition is embodied embedded enacted
and extended beyond the brain and she studies how this framework can help us understand and build other systems that
exhibit a form of augmented Mission including brain computer interfaces neurot Technologies and smart
environments in addition to this she co-founded the international Society of the philosophy of the Sciences of the
mind with gutier picini and she is currently the ethics uh ethics advisor
um in artificial intelligence versus the cognitive Computing company which
implements active inference into artificial intelligence agents um inz
thank you so much for joining me it's an absolute pleasure thank you so much for having me uh the pleasure is mine and
it's um we were just discussing off a that you know we're doing this across
many oceans so Nez is in Australia I'm in London um but we managed to sync it up which is which is fantastic exent so
I wanted to start with markof blankets um all things start with Mar
Markov blankets um Mark of blankets really play a fundamental role in active
and in the framework that we apply to artificial intelligence to cognition more generally and also just the
underlying physics and math of back to inference and a lot of your work has focused on Mark of blankets and the
scaling up of Mark of blankets so maybe a good place to start for our audience would be if you could just give a simple
overview of exactly what a mark of blanket is and then we can go from that yeah fantastic uh yeah you're absolutely
right when you say that everything starts with the mark of blanket everything that is a thing um is has got
a mark of blanket and that does not necessarily mean um that a mark of
blanket is going to correspond to a certain kind of like physical boundary that one can see uh right a mark of
blanket um is a theoretical formal construct that what it does is it tells
you um how or what things are going to be influencing a certain state to be the
case right so it's it is a statistical Tool uh precisely to understand
something really important uh which is how a certain thing is coupled with
within or with its environment um so everything does start everything has its
markco blanket does start with the markco blanket because it is a way in which we can
capture two very important aspects um and these two aspects um are that um a
thing um typically an open system as the thing um is um both thermodynamically
open and operationally closed so this is quite crucial um because it is what
allows the thing um to persist not to perish not to succumb to the second law
of Thermodynamics so Mark of blanket is really become uh very useful because to
my understanding um they allow us to capture simultaneously these two
features being both operationally open oh sorry operationally closed and
thermodynamically open because what happens is the system is situated in the environment in a way that it is open to
the environment it must be coupled with the environment otherwise it is uh perishing um it will not maintain itself
but it also has a certain boundary that allows it to maintain its coherent for
so the markco blankets become really interesting because they allow us to capture those two dimensions of um an
open system and what is an open system an open system is mostly everything that we see uh we don't really come across uh
closed systems excellent yeah that's great um I'm wondering whether you could give us
a sort of overview of exactly how that coupling works so people may have seen that the mark of blanket is essentially
composed of active States and sensory States um that makes sense if yet if
we're talking kind of about physical boundaries like actuators arms legs and so on but on the understanding The Mark
of blanket is a statistical entity what does um what what what
really are active States and sensory States um in the theoretical way well
there are many ways to answer this question um it will depend on how much you want to connect um then the active
inference framework and formalism uh with other uh theories that we find in
physics or in Neuroscience uh so there are many different ways in which one can
answer um this question um but for the sake of remaining um with the kind of
like more scale-free application of markco blankets and not reducing to
immediately uh to the brain um I will uh keep the formalism as something that we
can apply to understand the statistical relations or
influences um between a system an open system and its environment um right so
then what you have is you have the possibility of understanding how a
certain system is in a particular state so you understand that and then and then
what you can also understand is you can make predictions about future States in which you may find the system by virtue
of using this kind of for formulas right uh so then what you have is you employ
or Define that the level or aspects um of scientific interest are going to be
your internal States right and then your next question is going to be okay how do
I find this system in this PR in this precise uh time and space in these
particular States what are the the the the states uh in which the system is
situated that are going to be crucial for me to find the system in this
particular State and therefore I understand um the system and potentially ideally I can make some uh nice
predictions about future States so this will be our internal States so then what
we need to we need to get on is then we need to get to Define what are the external States and those are like I
said the states that are going to be influential uh for immediately influential for um the system to be in a
specific kind of like internal States now this is all done the next step is to
understand that internal and external States they mutually influence one
another that's what it means about something being an open system right is that there is exchange of mattera and
energy such that the system is remaining in a certain State and for example is
not um going into into a face space um uh such as like perishing or or towards
um towards uh death um so then um what what you get is an understanding of um
what I was just saying which is how the system is coupled and in this permanent
um continuous exchange of matter and energy in order to remain
alive and push back on the second LA themodynamics right so you get this
operationally closed and open system at the same time that is uh very well captured by these internal and external
States and I did say that uh they influence one another but it is important um to
understand that they do not directly influence one another they need a second set of States um so basically internal
and external states are conditionally in opin it and they will require the intervention of a second um set of
states which is very much what you asked uh the active and sensory States right
so these are going to be the ones that are doing the direct communication if
you will between each other where um hopefully and ideally we have um a
balanced influence between sensory and active States right and these um direct
influences between um sensory and active states are going to play a crucial role
in order for us to mathematically trap down and understand the coupling of the
system in the environment which is the system being internal States the environment being external States so
this is just like the overview of uh the mark of blanket and the active inference
formalism that we could apply to anything that is an open system wonderful yeah that's great
that's a really useful explication of the framework um I think it's as I kind
of hinted to in my initial question it's it's rather easy to think of it as a physical boundary so we can think of
cell boundaries or the blood Bane barrier or the boundaries of my body and
then when we do that the notion of sense reactive States really becomes intuitive
in the sense that in the case of my body all it is is an action perception Loop and that's being known to be critical to
intelligence or cognition for a very long time so that said there's also a very strong
position which is that it's actually just a statistical description of the way things act the way things persist
through time that leads me to ask the question of should we consider the markco blanket to be in uh interpreted
in an instrumentalist way in the sense that it's kind of a way it's a tool that we can use in modeling objects open
systems or is it or should we be inter in it in a realistic way I.E there is
actually something uh that is ontologically a mark of blanket that is
truly out there as a markco blanket um embedded within lots of other markco
blankets of course yes I'm really glad that you ask that uh question it's a Live question um and um there are many
ways to answer um this question so the way that I that I that I that I decided
to answer the previous question was was in a way that one understands that um a
mark of blanket is a tool is a statistical tool it's a formalism it's a
mathematical construct right and I also did not go immediately
into the brain uh or an organism with actions and Sensations because I'm
trying to avoid uh precisely um the literature that tends to reduce the
framework to thinking that active States and sensory states are going to be
action and sensation right that is not the case right um so a mark of blanket formalism
from active inference can be applyed to anything that is an open system and there are many um examples of this in
the literature such as for example I can think of um the example of when you have
a set of um of pendulums in a room or a set of clocks in the same room what's
going to happen is uh that eventually they will synchronize right and you can use this framework to capture to predict
that synchronization right so it is important to understand that this is a mathematical construct that you can
employ to precisely understand patterns of behavior in the natural world right
so we've done that um we understood that so then we can think about it you can
use this uh framework to develop for example simulation models which allow you to understand the phenomenon of
scientific interest as well as hopefully it's a good model is going to give you some prediction power over future states
of the thing which doesn't have to be uh anything to do with cognition can be something um uh that is situated in the
natural world right then a certain phenomenon happens specifically in
cognitive science when we notice that specifically in cognitive science even
if you apply a certain computational framework doesn't have to be active
inference a certain computational framework is applied to model simulate
for ex and get some predictive power about for example black holes let's say
black holes right uh and they use that kind of like mathematical framework and then you employ the same
kind of mathematical framework the same kind of like ationalism to understand the brain because after all both a black
hole and uh a brain are complex systems what does that mean it means that it is
extremely difficult for us to model it why is it extremely difficult to model it because it is very high in dimension
so it's really hard for us we don't have the computational power to to model it which is why we need to incorporate
something called uh dimensionality reduction because we don't have the tractability to to Pro precisely do that
now keeping up with what what I was saying in cognitive science specifically a phenomenon happens so
imagine this we use the same computational um strategy to model
things from the natural world all the way to the brain right and then what
happens is that we would never say that the brain had sorry that the the the
black hole or something that is not uh part of uh a living system would have uh
specifically a mark of blanket or would engage in literally active inference we
would understand very clearly that this is computational strategy that we are developing and employing for epistemic
purposes to understand the phenomenon and to get some predictive power that's
what we're doing and we are happy with it if we get some predictive power that's success in science and then one once we do this
move and apply exactly the same formalisms into for example the brain or an organism right we tend to
anthropomorphize it right so we tend to say okay so then the brain is acting
precisely literally by engaging in active inference or in other uh Realms
engaging in predictive coding right so we lose track of understanding that okay
these were the tools that we started off with and we were very happy when we were modeling black holes with these tools we
were happy that we had some predictive power but now it's not enough we won't more well now we want to go from The
epistemic Virtue into an ontological predictor now we want to say that the
thing that we are modeling trying to understand developing um uh models for
epistemic gain is precisely has the properties or the ontological properties
that the model the computational model has right and that's when you get into
making a realist or taking a realist stance on and upon active influence
right you don't have to you can do it but then you're going to have to defend
that position in a way that okay you're going to have to answer so if you are if
you are applying the question that you need to answer then is if you're applying exactly the same framework to
model and predict black holes that you want to do the same with
brains do you get to say that brains engage literally in active inference in
ways that black holes don't and why so that's the realism take and the problems
that you find and what where you would uh be led to or you remain in the more
cautious kind of position which is on the instrumentalist or non-realist position in which case the position is
that all things in the world with with with the real existence right and those things
behave in ways that we would develop models to understand that behavior in
terms of patterns patterns of behavior the things exist in themselves
they interact with the world in themselves the patterns of behavior are
our scientific constructs so then we talk and then we can start talking about okay so I can
pattern behavior through for example employing developing a model on the
basis of Maco blankets active inference and then I pattern the behavior what did
I did what I did was I found patterns and therefore an explanation for a
Behavior Uh and this explanation is something that I didn't have before right right right right well I'm going
to take us towards some realist position now because I think people will find it interesting about the
the ontological claims ontological implications uh that act of inference has especially within the cognitive
science and the Neuroscience community and I guess when you're taking a real stance on the Markov blanket that there
are these structures which have some kind of um embedded nature in the brain right and and people have probably heard
frisen talk about how this is actually reflected in the phen phenotypic nature of the brain and its
hierarchies um it makes me think about modularity so mod it for people who
don't know was introduced by Jerry Fodor um in 1983 and the basic idea is that modules
are these kind of um innate neural structures which have kind of very specific functions and fdor in 83 laid
out sort of certain category certain functions that they a modular system
would have to um you know would have to obey by so domain specificity the fact
that modules have to operate on a very specific type of input um there's also
informational encapsulation this idea that like at least how he portrayed it in 1983 that these modules are
encapsulated with respect to high orderer beliefs that that notion got sort of you
know weakened over time let's say and then there were further about the actual neural architecture would have to be
involved in mod uh modules but anyway people can get the basic idea um of a module we might have a visual
module a hearing module a module for language right which would yeah which is
idea clearly taken up um or that tronsky found a lot of joy in um all that to say
what does active influence have to say about this picture of the Mind as being modular to any interesting degree and
does this notion of kind of at least for predictive coding position position a
hierarchy in which you have feedback loops in which the top down affects the bot the top layers affect the bottom
layers and vice versa does that actually really have anything to say about modularity and more generally the
architecture of the brain yes um well I'm really glad that you you're taking us there we do have um a couple of
papers that do um engage a little bit with uh the modularity of the Mind one
of them is Mark of blankets in the brain and that paper and the the one is parcels and particles um and um in there
we do briefly mention um reasons why thinking uh or patterning
the the brain Behavior the brain activity in terms of markco blankets would be useful for many reasons uh for
for for for applications that go all the way to DCM uh dynamical caal modeling in in Neuro Imaging but I'm going to set
that to the side and I'm going to specifically speak to uh the modularity of the mind you very well said um the
modularity of the mind is is one of the is one of those um theories that we've
been having in philosophy of mind that has been very foundational for cognitive science and for the ways in which we ask
questions for the ways in which we look for things in the brain um and has been
uh as influential as it has been refuted uh so very few people today I can think
of three people people uh that would endorse good old school fodorian modularity of the mind and there are re
there are philosophical reasons for that and there are scientific reasons for that philosophically uh there's been
made very substantial solid strong arguments against it and uh
scientifically um evidence shows neuroplasticity shows neural reuse in
ways that would contradict uh the modularity of the mind I will make here
just a recting of a little bit of history of philosophy of mind just um
before I get into U the active inference um understanding of um cognitive SLB
brain um activity and Dynamics just to say that it's interesting to see that we have this tendency so I'll do a little
bit of philosophy of Mind here we have been having this tendency in philosophy of mind or at least analytic philosophy
of mind um which is to look at and this is a point that has been made by many um
influential philosophers uh for example Francis Egan um she has made this very uh clever point and I
think she's absolutely right when uh we look into World philosophers of Mind look into what is happening in computer
science and then we adopt the best computer science at the time to
establish a kind of like a metaphor to how the mind supposedly work at the time
as you said in 83 uh Jerry F looked at um uh touring machines and in he and he
asked the question what would happen if one would conceive the mind as if it
were a touring machine and then he writes the book right what happened is
that what starts off as being like sort of like metaphorical thinking right it
eventually starts becoming a very ontological uh claim that the mind is
ontologically modular and that is very um it's very important for us to look
back in history so that we know what to do and what not to do in the future right because what happens is then you
set off cognitive science to look for those modules in the brain as you set up experiments as you set up uh uh uh
simulations computational simulations you set off to look for and find those very um then you have all of those sets
of properties that are supposed to be the model so there's the automaticity there's the domain specificity there's
there's the information encapsulation there's the top down information oh sorry uh the B
information going all the way up to cognition cognition mean so all of that framework that was a theoretical
framework adopted from computer science then is defining the whole cognitive
science field and what we should look for right so it's quite interesting and important for us to know our history to
know how things really happen in a way that well you look back and and you see how how it then science came back and
said well it kind of actually doesn't make sense that the mind is modular in that way uh so not only philosophically
we have refuted it and very u in ways that we have forced the modularity of
the mind to reinvent itself to revise itself to survive really and what
happened was um because the problems were coming to arise from philosophy and from from from Neuroscience what
happened was we started having to revise the modularity of the mind because the noveles were coming up but we did not
want to let go of the modularity of the mind so we start revising the basic pillars and then we start having to let
go of basic pillars and that's when you have massive modularity by petas for example and still um challenges continue
to come up right so then you start going into this other uh this other field
which was known at the time um cognitive penetrability so now what you allow is
you you you you revise modularity to the point that it's not just bottom up information going up but now you will
allow for bottom up and top down that's cognitive penetrability right and then it comes up um around
2010 and stays until 2020 still is a little bit here because as we um sort of
like um explored a little bit in a in a in a special issue that we we we just had out um this year with Michael kof
it's a special issue in Consciousness and cognition and it's about uh the bean brain and how whether how or whether uh
the visian brain predictive coding is compatible to the modularity of the mind
and specifically to uh the one that allows the this traffic going up and
down um such as uh cognitive penetrability and there are still um a
few people that um very are very engaged um in defending that kind of um of
modularity of the mind that is um quite um agreeable and comp comptible with
predictive coding and examples of that are for example more conservative um uh
approaches within U predictive processing theories of the mind for example the predictive mind prediction
error minimization uh mostly developed uh and headed by um by yakob Hui um that
would be one that um you can find as as as having some agreement with with
modularity of the mind of course the revised version of it which is uh the one in which uh it
is it allows traffic to go up and down and that's of course you can see the parallel as it being predictions coming
down prediction errors coming up and the traffic being very contentful in nature
therefore you have a version that it has got this compatibility between modularity of the mind and um and um and
the the predictive uh brain what happens is and I'll just wrap this up and go um
then to active inference what happened there if you think about it is you let
go of two things that were very precious for Jerry fer you let go of horizontal
boundaries and vertical boundaries and once you let go of that you really have to ask the question what is left of the
modularity of the Mind why should we keep it in place at all whatsoever right because what happened was you let go of
one there was the basic pillar of of the modularity of the mind which was the
boundary that was a distinguishing or dividing uh cognition on top and modules
at the bottom right this boundary doesn't you don't have this boundary anymore because now you have predictions coming down so you let go of this
boundary so Jerry doesn't get that and they have the vertical boundaries as well which
were very precious because those were about information encapsulation such that different modules are the main
specific and they do not talk to each other right so what you is you get rid of those vertical boundaries there's
there's an interesting there's an interesting historical point there um that just sorry to interrupt but this is
an interesting there there's an interesting chronology here which I actually learned during my undergrad where when I was looking at whether the
language comprehension was fundamentally modular so it was related that's hence why I brought up n jsky in 83 fodal has
very distinct definitions of information encapsulation and Dom specificity so do specificity is actually what we just
spoke about that there's a proprietary database that each module works on right so visual the visual module work on uh
photons or whatever you know or the language module works on syntactic
nodes and information informational encapsulation in 83 was top down beliefs
expectations doesn't affect the workings of those modules interestingly in in
2000s so he he writes another book or or article about modularity in the year
2000 he kind of conflicts and again I don't want to speak ill of Jerry fodo he's very important and he's also not
here anymore so he can't defend himself but he seems to confuse information encapsulation with dom specificity
because he talks about like this is a quote that a system is encaps a module is encapsulated if it's restrict if it
function is restricted to what its proprietary database contains so I think what's interesting there is factly what
you're were talking about in terms of horizontality and verticality kind of abandons the verticality there right he
wants to uh yeah he he abandons the verticality in the sense that by by sort
of a mission he concedes that maybe we should let go of this idea that top- down beliefs expectations don't
influence lower levels he does keep the um the horizont horizontality which is
let's keep these as distinct systems working on discrete um languages or data
for ones of a better ter so so it's just an interesting historical fact there that I think if he was H frodel might um
he could obviously offer some clarification but may also go back on his original 83 position of top down um
the the restriction for top down information to flow into modules yes absolutely and um I think that this is
also how you are absolutely right um in in in specifically the point about the
conflation between information and caps olation and the main specificity these are two different things and one of the things that are
that one of the aspects that I think would would need to be abandoned and that we abandoned in our Mark of
blankets in the brain is precisely that notion of information right so because you can
have domain specificity without relying on this notion of information encapsulation and things not conversing
with each other because again to my perspective that is anthropomorphizing the brain and brain activ ity right
we're talking about Dynamics and activities of the biology kind in the
brain and there is an anthropomorphization uh that I don't think it's necessary and again it proved
itself unnecessary right um so um but but we learn so much from from learning the
history of where these ideas come from and they have a place of course U and I think it's important for us to precisely
learn where they come from such that we start um improving and advancing our
understanding of uh the brain and cognition in different ways so there is
definitely place for for for Jerry Fodor um and I think that this is the place is
to get us into other other other uh advancements in the field and what um
what we have been able to to to to to see and uh through scientific evidence
in in in neuroscience precisely that that kind of way of thinking that may
have started as a metaphor doesn't really hold right and that there may be
um domain specificity I think you put it in a very nice way there may be domain
specificity without it being information encapsulation right and once you start
having to let go of all of these basic pillars of modularity it's gone we can
try to salvage it and then call it something and brand it something else but it's gone and that's when then you
also see in the history well we have now new um computational uh capacity or
strategy such as parallel distributed processing what shall we do let's try to apply the same thing that we did which
is what if we would think about the mind as if it were a parallel distributed processing system and then you have the
networks and predictive processing theor start rising up on the base of that analogy as well I am careful about going
over and abond and above the anal the it being a metaphor right because I always
think about the brain as a very biological kind of system as opposed to
a full agent with full capacities that thinks and reasons and models as if it were a scientist so I push back on that
I'm careful about that so the way from that position on then the way in which we theorize Mark of blank blanket is
being useful was you start from those understandings that the brain is a dynamical complex
system right that it changes over time that the ways in which
a full agent engages with the environment is going to have
significant impacts on the ways in which pathways are strengthened or are
weakened in the ways in which the brain is going to develop itself as an organ right
so you start from that very neurobiology kind of understanding of the brain that it is a complex system
meaning that it is a coupled system it is situated in a body it is situated within other organs uh in in in the
organism and this organism is situated in the environment right so we we we completely abandon the view of the brain
as being a predictive machine there even though you can and there's lit chore on
building upon the idea of the brain which of the brain being a predictive machine which comes from from Helm holds
and more recently you can theorize it and I've been um I've been presenting on that as you you can theorize it as the
low road or the high road to active inference which we can talk about later but the view is you can take that
pathway that's not the one that we took uh we took the pathway of the very neurobiology uh kind of way of the brain
being a highly situated organ within a larger system the larger system being
situated in an environment and all of these influences and interactions are
going to have an effect on the state that you're going to find the brain in a specific uh uh um point in time and
space so so then um starting from that understanding as opposed to the brain
being a a machine uh right so then we ask the question of whether or not uh
because this is what this is crucial this is the crucial point which is why I started by by describing mark of blink
is is this scientific construct that you can apply skill free comes skill free uh
that you can apply to anything that is a thing there is an open system you can apply it you can also apply it to the
brains but then you once you do that you have to test it out right you have to look into okay does this really make
sense can we find patterns of activity that would be explainable
through the application of Mark of blankets at different levels of
organization within the brain itself so then in that particular paper what we did was we we are we start from a
standpoint where we reject the modularity of the mind because we do not think that there are reasons scientific
reasons to think that the the the the the brain is
organized in very strict rigid ways call it modules whatever we want to call it
but in very strict rigid ways we do not think that that's the case because there is scientific reason not to take that
path and the Brain being a very Dynamic and changing um system then the question
that you have is how do we make sense of it right how do we find patterns in such
a dynamical system in such a coupled system how do we find those patterns can
we find those patterns so then let's apply this um uh Mark of blanket formulas
at different levels given the data that we have coming from DCM coming from
dynamical causal modeling of the brain so basically um in very very simple terms The View here is that we put the
brains in Scanners we get data out of the scanner and then we look at that and
just vast data the comic sense of it Con and start to think about how to make sense of that you employ DCM as a model
to make sense of that data and what you would get get from that is a nice causal topology about how um uh uh how
connections are made and Dynamics are formed so you get a nice pattern of that
if the model is is is is suitable and useful then you that's what you get so then from that kind of like um
scientific um point we we we grab all of that all of those nice models uh from
DCM and we see we look at whether or not we could apply the mark of blanket
formalism so the four the two sets of States um internal and external active
and sensory States in order to uh get an explanation of those pattern Dynamics at
different scales so we start off with the the scale of a single neuron and
then we have a cical column and then we have regions right and what is the what
is the the the take on message from this because of course if if anybody's interested uh in the details then the
paper is out there um but what is the take on message there is that we do find
the same patterns of behavior across scales by virtue of employing this uh
formalism and that is that is really good that's already quite um quite quite quite important because that means that
you can get what we started off our conversation with you can get um
understandings of activity that is occurring in the brain at different
scales where uh each of those scales is both operationally closed and
thermodynamically open so then what you get is you let completely go of that
rigid systems that you had with the modularity of the mind you completely let go of that and what you get is an
understanding of how um certain neurons in in in specific um environments you
can think about it in a very simple way as like a cell in a Cell tissue how a cell in a Cell tissue is interacting and
engaging with the tissue in order to do what it needs to do um so you can think
about you can use this formalism to precisely understand how that particular
system is behaving according to the environment that it is at so then you find these patterns of behaviors of like
certain neurons firing given certain um conditions and then you get all this
nice understanding of discou Behavior being situated that is highly Dynamic
and it really is dependent on the environment that it is situated at what
you also realize is that there are certain parts of the brain there are
certain specific parts of the brain um that you can see that they may be
insulated that they they they do not um conform to um active inference they do
not exchange um and that's in a way if you wanted to say that would be what Jerry F
had in mind as a modularity of the mind you could say that but all that happens there is a very simple bi biology
process which is the system already knows what to do without needing to know
what is going on in the environment it is what we say as it is set by Evolution
it works so it's been working so well that way that it doesn't need to know or get to know feedback from its
environment right so those would be the ones in which you would say oh it's encapsulated but it's informationally
encapsulated I wouldn't say so right right right right yeah there's a lot of that there's a lot of that um
cool I mean it I you also gave a really nice um description of for cognitive
science there so exactly as I said in my introduction um the four e for those who
can't remember embodied extended see if I remember enacted extended you get all
of them yeah um and I'm enjoying the history lesson as well so um because I
do as as you said I think the chronology is really important here just to get a picture of the philosophical foundations on which this work is being done but
eight years after Jerry Fodor releases the modularity of the Mind the very important book comes out which is the
embodied mind of Raa Thompson and rash before we go there because you work I
guess within that framework of as you said for cognitive science the embodied mind I think listeners will be curious
about you you mentioned scientific evidence refuting uh
modularity I just wondering if you could provide this maybe just with one example of a module which is not exhibiting the
typical um the typical features that Fodor laid out which would make it fundamentally modular so what what makes
it open let's say to its environment yeah one very clear example comes from the all the research in neural reuse so
that would itself already um sort of like move us away or it's it's I would
say it's it's strong reasons to move away from that rigidity of modules that
are do not change that are um as Jerry fod would conceive of it they are
hardwired in that way so another feature that you lose is the automaticity right
so the idea with the auto automaticity is that modules in a way are silly right
they don't know really what's going on they are hardwired to automatically process the information that they domain
specific to right so that's the automat automaticity they don't really have a
say in the meta so to speak um even though I'm completely anop anthropomorph
ing this story as as one would with the modularity of the mind uh so you you do
lose that um with with with the the the large evidence on on on um on neural
reuse where you see um which is extremely compelling and it it's
absolutely fascinating that you see certain neurons that we used to be
neurons for vision to become neurons for something else like like odit Tre system
for example depending on the necessity of the whole overall
system so what you see is the neural reuse um uh cases where well it really
it really challenges the basic aspects or properties that would make a module a
module right don't make domain specific or is it domain specific if it becomes the main specific to something else uh
the automaticity um as well so the the the the neural reuse um I think would be
a it's it's a great challenge um another one is of course neuroplasticity so the
studies in neuroplasticity do um challenge again the rigidity of uh the
the the the the non changeability of this hardwired um system yeah absolutely
okay great that's really useful yeah yeah I always think about um I think I got to about the murk effect when I was
learning about modularity of mind which is this auditory visual illusion that when people yeah people can search
up or do the murk effect but again that that brings into question um this encapsulated idea that muls can't speak
to each other okay excellent well as I said what became very popular uh after
these kinds of rigid computational accounts of the Mind was an activist
embodied models following verel Thompson and rush and verel was of course a
biologist and so um and he introduced the term aesis which kind of means this self
organization that we now speak of or self- evidencing um before 1991 so so as
you were saying we are inclined now to look at the brain as a biotic thing as a
biological system and this is very much uh for grounded in um embodied cognition
maybe it would be useful for everyone if we could just go through the four e
firstly um it doesn't it doesn't have to be super it's a very rich history um so I'm you know as long as short as is
suitable but maybe we could go yeah one by one and think about where is the
evidence or where is he philosophy or as the intuition that this is true um and
we can start I guess with the the first one which is embodiment what what does embodiment mean and kind of what is the
research around the embodied brain what what does it focus on what does does it Center on all right very very good um so
um embodiment is um something that is is a concept that comes from phenomenology
um from the existentialist Philosophy from phenomenology it's a very rich uh
concept and it is fundamental to understand a lot of confusion in the
field because we need just we need to distinguish between weak and strong embodiment I will call strong embodiment
the one that comes from chology and existentialist philosophy such as the one that for example Sim B had in mind
the body that one has that grounds our experience of the world that's the kind of embodiment from SIM
or um and um then within the E Frameworks uh within the E framework you
have different theories and while they do agree with let's say a couple of um
principles they are going to disagree age with within certain more nuanced
aspects of their own theories and I think the embodiment is one that is mostly useful for us to understand the
State of Affairs in the field and the theory and the confusions right so um
let's say that it is very reasonable to to think that most people in the field
of cognitive science today are not going to reject that the body plays a role to
understand the brain that the body plays a role to understand cognition very few people would disagree with this right
the followup question is how do you understand the body and I will get to that I will just say that only those
that would conceive of cognition as encapsulated in the brain as a computer
system such as the prediction error minimization accounts or for example
yakob who is kind of conservative account um that there he says very
clearly you can throw away the body the world and other people because the brain sufficiently as a machine takes care of
the cognitive business so that would be the only account that I know of that would not bring in the body to play a
fundamental role all other accounts do agree I think we have come to that
agreement that the body plays a fundamental role embodiment plays a fundamental role now the question the
follow-up question is how do conceive of embodiment and then you have two ways the weak and the strong weak embodiment
is the one that is endorsed for example by um predictive processing theories such as Andy Clark as the Visionary uh
behind it what happens there is that Andy Clark in his account invites the
body to play a causal role in cognition and this is important because also with the with the with the with the with the
body you can um interact with a world that is Technologic iCal where there are
things that then give you the extended mind but I'll I'll get to that if if we
have the time anyway so it's weak embodiment what does this mean this means that um cognition is a predictive
processing that takes place in the brain so this agrees with more conservative
predictive uh aor minimization accounts but not only in the brain predictions
but the prediction processing machine includes the body what does this mean
this means that the body is seen as part of the predictive machine the body is
seen as computational cognition is computational so that's why this is weak
embodiment so anic clar does not endorse the embodiment that MTI or Sim had in
mind he endorses a very computationalist kind of embodiment so this is why you
can kind of like to understand the E cognitive science you kind of have to spread it out within a range and then
you get like um you get like the more conservative ones and the more radical ones right the more conservative ones
are the ones that are going to say that cognition is computational the more
radical ones are going to say that cognition is not computation and then you have a spread out of of um of the
question that you can ask to help navigate the ecognition uh literature is
how radical do you want to be because if you want to say that cognition is computational you're not
radical at all right and radical doesn't have anything to do with original
radical just means how radical you are in comparison to Old theories such as
the the the computational theory of mind what is the computational theory of mind is everything we' been talking about with the modularity of the mind and
predictive processing theories this is all computational theory of Mind how radical are you in relation to the computational theory of Mind where are
the basic assumptions are to that cognition comes down to um uh
computational processes of information processing that's computational theory of mind and that the mark of the mental
is mental representation there would be more Nuance thing things to say but this would be two that you can ask yourself
and then you can ask how radical am I away from these two assumptions right so
that's the view and then you get like this weak embodiment which is very close to or if not it is um kind of like right
in the border between computational theory of mind and ecognition almost like shouldn't be there if you would
conceive that uh cognition within e the E umbrella is not computational right uh
so that's the very weak embodiment and then you have the strong embodiment which is any theory that explains
cognition by grounding cognition very much uh within the embodiment that the
experience that one has of the world of course here what we talking about is uh
the level of analysis and and understanding that uh people working in that field are looking at is um about
the full um agent that is situated in an
environment we are not talking about neurons of course we take that into consideration in the sense of the causal
relations that I mentioned before which is how is it that the experience of the world is going to aect effect and
influence the Bly biological processes and in there you also find the brain so
that's kind of like the strong embodiment from mopon H and all of that kind of thing uh that we have and mostly
applies to uh psych Psychotherapy and and and and psychological analysis and
then you get into um uh let's say in activism right and then in an activism
you find um different kinds again but let's say that both strong embodiment
and in activism they reject these two things they reject that cognition is a
computational process of information processing uh and they reject that the mark of the mental is mental
representation so they reject these two things right they reject in kind of like different ways but non not
non-compatible but they they they want to reject these two assumptions um so
the an activist um has different different ways um in which uh you can
also formulate of it um so you have the verela Thompson and rush so verela and
Matana uh starting the autopoetic um uh in
activism uh which is a very rich uh literature very based in in biology and
extremely compelling uh and very well formed um and then of course um others
more recently pick up on um autopoetic and activism and uh they have developed
more recently um the framework towards uh sense making uh in activism now I
want to just stop here to go to autois just to make the bridge with active inference where you can right where or
at least where I find that it's reasonable to make that breach um autoptic and activism um brings out and
a lot of recent work by an activists they also stress uh that out um they
bring out the understanding of crucial aspects of living systems from bacteria
to us um as having those two aspects as being thermodynamically open and as
being operationally closed and those two aspects Lounge the system into a state of precariousness so these are main
Concepts within theop poetic and activism and what this can then mean
that we can think of is that what does it mean for a system to be precarious well what it means is that the system
must must must interact with the environment in order to remain alive
what does this mean well this means that the system is coupled with the environment now again what does this
mean this means that the system the living being cannot be encapsulated from the environment what this would refute
is the conservative computationalist views that cognition comes down to being encapsulated in the brain and we can
throw away the body the world and other people so that's kind of like what this means so that's why the question is how
radical are you from The View that cognition comes down to computations in the brain right how radical are you so
we're making our way towards a more radical one and then once you find these ideas of like operationally closed
thermodynamically open therefore a state of precariousness therefore must be coupled otherwise it dies then you say
well this active inference framework actually captures that very nicely because I get conditional independency
from internal and external stat that would allow me to get the operationally closure but I also get the direct
influence of being thermodynamically open that comes from active and sensory States so then it really nicely captures
that state of precariousness as a tool so that's that's nice I think and then
you can um you can go as radical as you want which is to completely push back on
um any views or kinds of theories or ways of thinking that would bring out uh
cognition and cognitive systems from bacteria to more sophisticated inculturated systems like us um as um
being computational of any kind and this is something that I've been presenting as augmented cognition in the in the
sense of um the kinds of like computational models that we develop um and
mathematical thinkings that we develop they are our cultural PR practices right
so in that sense we developed these very sophisticated ways of making sense of
the natural world of which brains are part of living systems are part of right
we develop all of those very highly sophisticated systems and computational
um capacity um to make sense of the world around us and what I'm very very
careful is not to make that last step which would bring me back to the computational theory of mind to say that
those computational strategies are ontological predictors of what the brain
is of or or of what the living system is so I am very careful about that that
maybe put me in the very radical position because I reject all of the computational theory of mind uh view um
so that's how you kind of like make your way within the ecognition is by asking how radical are you in respect to to
computational the of mine excellent great um I think we have
two more e but we but we basically touched upon them um one is
embedded um and the next one is extended um do I give a brief absolutely word to
that absolutely so um the embedded one is the one that as I was spre spreading it out in range and I was saying that
well um you have here very close uh you have a bound with the computational
theory of mind and here you have the radical stuff so embedded is here close to the the the computational theory of
mind and this is the E that I mentioned before when I explained that um very few
people in com in cognitive science in the field would reject that the brain is
embedded in the body and the body is embedded in the environment very few people would reject that so that's the
embedded that's why this can be seen as almost close to the weak em embodiment
that's the embeddedness very few people would talk about encapsulation only with that exception
of the one that is the prediction rization by Yakov can throw away the world um and other PE the body and other
people so that's the embededness is just the claim that the body is the brain is
situated in the body the body is situated in the environment now then how you are going to explain that situatedness is where you are going to
fall in different ease in the strong embod in the different kinds of uh in activism
the radical in activism or the more sense making in activism um how you are going to explain that it's the
embeddedness is what's going to make the difference on our radical you go and then you have the extended which I
briefly mentioned um so the extended comes as a part of like a package uh
with um uh radical predictive processing by and Clark so the package is that um
it it is it is radical in uh relation and in comparison with prediction and
minimization um or conservative one it's radical in relation to that but it's not radical in relation to other eats so
what happens is that what you have is an understanding of cognition as being a computational process that takes place
where well not only in the brain but also in the body right the body plays a causal role for that information
processing predictive processing to occure and to happen uh in the ways that it does now it can also incorporate
objects tools from the environment that are going to play a causal role of the
same kind as um your body plays so then you have a whole system that is
distributed it's is a computational system we still talking about computational theory of mind it is a computational system that involves brain
body and tools and that's the extended mind great um and yeah I always feel the
need to kind of refer people to where these ideas come from so um extend of my hypothesis Clark and Chara's classic
paper um and definitely worth checking out I think when I hear uh these
stronger an activist or stronger for recognition um perspectives which refute
representation as the mark of the mental or Mark of cognition it makes me think
uh where does Consciousness fit into all of this because as a conscious
um you know subject uh being with a subjective start upon the world I you
know I I have some sympathy for the enti list view because I think it feeds into some intuitions that I can't like this
mind is privileged and can be divorced in some sense from the world upon which it does some computational work so if
really we we we take the privilege away from representation um
which which I think is also a kind of worm so we don't have to get into exactly what is a
representation but maybe we maybe we can go there um what's what's the kind of R
of qualia subjectivity intentionality and the kind of uh features of
Consciousness oh thank you for that question I always feel like when um when
we go that path um the mental representation being the mark of the mental um it feels like uh we are
getting to watch a TV show halfway through like in season two right because we don't ask the questions where the
representations and content comes from right so that's the hard problem of content so I know that we want to get
that because that would allow us because we already are in the place where we do
have me we can engage and develop and more and more every more sophisticated mental representations that what we are
that's what part of what we are doing here is engaging in ways in which we are involving and employing uh mental
representation such that we can understand each other right so it's like we're already half season halfway
through this through the TV show we are already like in season three um so but there was a beginning of the TV show
right well you didn't have any of this you as a baby as an infant could not be communicated with me in this way about
these things where does that come from that comes from something called inculturation right so I think before
before we start explaining things as if they were always like that we need to understand that there is a trajectory in
cognition in cognitive development that we shall not forget so all of those things had to be acquired unless you
want to defend nativism that that would be also could could be very close to Jerry F as well
because you already have these starter packs that you already have this very very much in place um Machinery that
would allow us you to have all of these sensory all of this semantic content already ready to use that you could
start making sense now if you reject folder you reject it all now you have to
answer the question how can we do this where does this come from you've rejected folder right so you have a
story to tell now the way that I I see it and many um in activists do see it uh
and by the way also very much compatible than with mathematical uh Frameworks of
dynamical and complex Theory um and that is that is employed in in in a lot of
psychology uh uh Empirical research as opposed to the computational theory of mind uh even though that's the
mainstreaming in cognitive psychology it's not the only one um and the way in
which you can think about it is that you um cognition the m so what I'll start by
saying this I've I've heard many times people ask me but how is it possible
that there's cognition but there is no no mental representations no one is saying that so that's not a claim that's
not a claim from an activist an activist an activists don't say that there aren mental representations what they tell
what they want to tell you is that mental representations do not come for free you are not born with them you had
to do things in the environment in order to acquire them you have to to develop
it as a skill so we give you a story about a hard problem of content where does that come from when it does not
come as within the nice starter pack that cherry foder or decart would tell
you that it comes from so once you get rid of that you have a story to tell and the story is that it depends on
inculturation so basically as you start as an infant as a baby we we come into
the world and we start interacting with the world this world is and this is the key point this world is already social
it's already a social cultural setting there is no baby that is born and is developing within a setting that is not
social already so it is in the ways in which the baby interacts with the their
caregivers that the parents are the caregivers and the world around them
that is going to gradually allow them to build um simpler um Concepts simple ways
of using Concepts and then scuff holding that into a a numerical system in a
conceptual framework and then later on in being able to engage in logical
thinking and reasoning and then being able to express some sophisticated ideas
and maybe even becoming a scientist and contribute to developing highly sophisticated computational models that
study black holes so it's an inculturated process of course as we are
here doing this interaction um what we are using is we are making the best use
of our most skilled to so far uh and I'm sure that um that will go keep going in
a in a in a a trajectory but our best skills of um explaining ideas and
discussing so we are using and making the best use of our best mental representations but I also have to say
that this interaction does not reduce to those U mental representations there is
an embodiment aspect of the situation that we are at a a very clear uh example
of that is that the interaction is different whether or not we are having the interaction in person or we are having the interaction online we'll make
things different because we don't share the same physical space so this is just an example of um how embodiment here
would play uh uh uh some some would play out but the idea is that eventually
you'll start developing the capacity to develop and engage in mental representations also as you talk to
other people and you make sense of the world around you okay cool um I'm going to play not
going to play Devil's Advocate but um and I also don't want to make you commit to any position nor am I asking you to
solve the hard problem of Consciousness because that's not that's not going to happen this also not the purpose of the
podcast but I understand in that sense that mental representations are kind of
Downstream on enacted behavior on social cultural norms right it they as you say
there's a lot of evidence to suggest that it's not some hardwired Chomsky and module right there we can take that as
kind of axiomatic I guess my question here is that kind of makes sense in terms of mental representations per se let's say
they develop out of this inactivist um way of being that we have what it
doesn't necessarily answer is the kind of characteristic features and the idiosyncratic features of
Consciousness so the actual like fundamental what it is like to be me
what it is like to be you to use Thomas Nagel's terms so I guess my question here is
um again not trying to pin you down I understand there's a lot of nuance here would the an activist be uh sort of
would they be attracted to the notion that Consciousness is epip phenomenal and by that I mean for people who don't
know epip phenomenal Consciousness is the idea that Consciousness is like the steam coming off a steam train so it's
caused by uh neural physiological Behavior but doesn't actually have any causal effect on those um on those
mechanisms so it happens it's there right and it kind of depends on what philosophy of Mind Theory you um
subscribe to but would they say that Consciousness has no causal role um I'm
imagining that there aren't many substance dualist in activists but what
what what kind of considerations have they made of the role of Consciousness right um so I I I'll just bring some
some something in so that so when we talk about qualia uh
epiphenomenalism um um and uh what it is like um like in the bat um what is like
to be a bad Thomas nle when we are or or the the hard problem of Consciousness when we talk about that we are within a
certain conceptual toolkit right we are already within what
wienstein would call a bottle a theory right and it's important to to to
understand that when we start making our way within a
theoretical path it's like we're building blocks of a house and then we getting a certain kind of house by
virtue of the the belief system thoughts that and the path that we are
doing that's the kind of like conceptual Machinery that you get once you play
that game so and by playing that game I'm here referring to or having in mind
viin Stein's language games so you can tell the story of or you can do the epistemology of
understanding uh how cognition comes around and about and works by playing
different games and that is the traditional analytic philosophy of Mind
Game and that game is very associated with the computational theory of mind so
what I'm trying to say here is that once you put on certain goggles there are certain things that you're going to see
and there are certain things that you cannot see so once you start on that path of
thinking Journey those are the problems that you're going to find those are the problems that like the hard problem of Consciousness is a problem that you're
going to find because then what you get is uh how do we study both the easy
problem and the hard problem so you necessarily when you start going in that direction you find those problems and
then you have the explanatory Gap that how we close the gap so these are problems that come up within the
computational theory thinking language game so those are the goggles right and of course we can try to make
these theories talk to each other but it's very important to understand that it's almost like axiomatic in the sense
that you start solving an equation in one way it the equation will look a
certain way you start solving the equation in a different way the equation will look in a in a different way right
so that's almost what we are talking about right because we are not starting
from the point in E cognition doesn't start from the point of view of the
brain in the other um more traditional computational theor of M of course it does so once you do start from the bra
brain being machine note what questions come up okay so if the brain is a machine then how is it that it gives
rise so it's a scaling up problem how is it that it gives a rise to Consciousness
how does this machine give rise to Consciousness because there are there is evidence that there's Consciousness that
is what it is like to be about there's qualia there's a hard problem of Consciousness this is within that kind
of thinking because you start by the brain being a machine and then you ask how do we get to the good stuff and then
you get all of that from within the more radical e cognitive science you don't
start from the brain being a machine that's the first thing you reject right and that's also in dynamical and complex
systems theory the case you have phenomenal work by Van Helder and other people that precisely reject that
cognition has anything to do of being anywhere or we should use any conceptual
uh any concept from a computational scientist perspective to Kit right so
then you don't start from there you start from the point of view that living systems are precarious and they engage
with the world to maintain themselves the brain is part of the story but you
don't start there right so in this engagement what happens is you have you
engage with the world because you have certain goals usually the goals have to do in a more minimalistic biology way is
that you don't want to die it's the precariousness of of pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics right so
you engage in the world for that reason because you want to remain alive typically this is the most basic biology
there's much more than that but let's just stay with that so then what happens is you start exploring the world and in
exploring the world you do that by exploring your body so that's when the body comes in as the body is the means
by which you have access and explore the world and respond to the world's and
invitations to exploration so it is in these interactions with the world that are extremely embodied and limited
they're both constrained and possible by the body that whatever you do it's
cognitive behavior and this cognitive behavior is what are the goods that we
want to understand in cognitive science and we do that by by explaining them
through patterns of behavior right so it's completely different
goggles yeah I I am going to push back because I think it's I think it's good it's not adversarial it's collaborative
um I I just sense or I just kind of believe that the Vicken styan relativism
has its has its limits right it has its points where you say well there are certain things that maybe aren't
relative in the language game and maybe one of those are the fundamental aspects
of my experience that I can attest to regardless of if I'm in a braid of
lat or if I'm an evil demon is tricking me right like unless I adopt some illusionism about Consciousness which
I'm not willing to do but again like it's not there there's not a viable position to do but I'm going to take it for granted that like even even radical
illusionists wouldn't say that qualia doesn't exist it's just not what we think it is and I'm think here Kei Frankish and den it so for me like the
Vick steinan relativism that qualia is itself part of a um Paradigm to use a
sort of term of Thomas [ __ ] or it's part of a boss or it's part theoric yes in the sense of the linguistic aspect of it
but the fundamental phenomenon is at least for what I can tell is real so
what is the alternative I guess is my question right yet I I I don't I'm not refuting the notion that a cognition is
in some way constrained and opened up impossibility by having a body by being embedded in the social context and so on
but we still have to GR in my opinion we still have to grasp with the fundamental
facts of phenomenal experience so I'm sorry if I sound like David Charmers and
David Charmers parrot but no it seems to me that like I can't get away from the
explanatory Gap and I don't think that that's a problem in my theoretical framing of the problem I think
that's because the phenomena phenomena associated with Consciousness is so radically different from anything else
in the physical Universe yeah and and there are very um I must say that there
are very good points that are made by David chalas in that respect that I that I uh very much um agree with
um now to go back to that and to link that in a way that would be um that
would be compatible within uh my view of an activism I would say that and also
wienstein um there is a real world that you don't
have access to so I completely agree with what you said right I completely agree uh that
there is a limit to relativism yes that's the limit the limit is the limits of my view I'm not going to say the
limits of my language as which I did in the first in the first book in trus because you overcame that so I'm just
going to um I'm going to dare to reformulate that for him and say the limits of my perspective are my world so
there's there there there are aspects of the world that I will not have access
to and that's just the way things are I will not have access to your experience of the world because and here's the
inactivist bit coming in because my experience
is determined by the set of past interactions that
I've had with the world and this moment right here where um this experience is
taking place and everything else outside of this I don't have access
to that's the bit in the Bo in in the box right so the the the idea is not the rejection
of other perspectives and that's precisely vien Stein's point is understanding understanding that there are it's the humility of understanding
that there are other perspectives in the world and you do not have access to them you only have access to your own uh very
um specific kind of perspective to the world now another thing that he adds that it may be uh useful um is to say
that for him these are seen in terms of aspects of the
world you see the world through the aspects that are made relevant to you
right here right now given what given your past experiences your past interactions of the world that's why
certain things will become Salient in this particular moment in the environment which connecting to the
other Theory you would call the what it is like to be me to what it is like see
I don't know if I would um the well to me I wouldn't right I
mean the the salience of my environment I completely agree is shaped by my body
it's shaped by my homeostatic requirements it's shaped by my sociocultural upbringing status and so
on but the fact of the matter is is that things we could describe things as being
Salient without necessarily invoking well that's a good question I guess whether we could invoke salience
of out Consciousness but I guess I I mean as a force experiment you can in a sense um I had John Vu on last
week and he was talking about relevance realization and so it's very sort of still fresh in my mind I said my my
reading of this would be that salience is just a manifestation of the conscious experience itself but are we going to
get any closer to the actual fundamental characteristics right like whether it's salience or visual perception or
auditory perception I mean like the Charmers problem is still there
right uh the Chara's problem is okay let's let me just go back to the initial thing because otherwise I'll lose it um
that you said um um the the note that the difference between the Frameworks is
quite it's quite this simple thing which is Things become relevant and Salient
and experienced in a certain way within ecognition because of the embodied
experiences that you've had in the past within a computational theory of mind you might say the same you might say
things are relevant what it is like to be me why well because of the way that
information has been process processed in the brain as a as a as a machine so these are different explanations for the
same kind of phenomenon they're diff they are completely different so this is where they are aart
right um now as to the problem of um the heart I think when you said Chara
problem you meant the heart problem of Consciousness right um y okay so it may
be the case and this is also a Vian sign move so I'm not going to take credit for that um uh it may be the case and this
is very in line with with David chers which is why I think there are certain features of it of of of chmer thinking
that I that I really like and agree with um vians makes this point not everything
that is there to be understood about the mind can be understood through the
scientific meod and this is the hard problem of consciousness that chmer talks about
right and and I think that he makes a good point there I think that he is very
um cever and very very correct and I completely agree with three points that
he makes which is that many people are falling up on the Trap of claiming to
study Consciousness and experience and a first person however you want to call it
depending on the theory you're coming from um embodiment if you like they claim to study embodiment and conscious
experience and all of those kind of like good things that really make us by going to the brain Alone by
studying easy stuff and that is a theoretical trap it's a fallacy and
that's where I really agree with with David charma's work which is why I'm doing what I'm doing in in ecognition
precisely because I do not want to get into that trap which I think it's it's a trap as well I agree with him great
wonderful well that's our that's our convergence point and again I it's it's it's not so much that we need to solve
the hard problem but I'm just curious about whether it retains its problematic nature in in for so that that that's
good to get some clarity on that I Rend I wonder just it it's it's a difficult
question but and again I'm not trying to get you to solve the whole problem I'm just curious about your thoughts on this
I said I had John Vu on last week and he's got this idea that getting more
precise on the f function of Consciousness would help us in resolving the nature of Consciousness
the hard problem do you see any viability in that
link you can get some something by the function if you within the Frameworks
that I work on active inference and activism right Within These Frameworks I'm going to give the answer within these Frameworks you can get some
explanatory traction you can get some um epistemic virtue out of thinking function but it doesn't get you all the
way through it gets you to understand the precariousness and why systems
behave in the way that they do it's because they the function is that they want to push back on the second law of
Thermodynamics they want to remain alive but then you think about a point that Simon DEA made which is also a very
clever point which is if all that is to life is to not to
perish then what is it that makes us different to vegetation right so function gives you
as much as it's interesting and relevant to the point that it explains or it
gives you as far as a cross life explanation so one thing that you get is
the function is all life does not want to die typically That's the Law that's
the that's the free energy principle that's all but it gets you as far as that and
you want more because you want to get to the goods of like uh embodied experience right why
people behaving the way that they do right so here I think
that you can bring in also again some on the above wise is is is I think is a
good segue into um making this point which is very under the E umbrella but I think she makes this point in in a way
that here is it's going to make the point um clearer which is that if if
again going back to the point if all that is to life is not to perish then what makes us different from vegetation
what makes us different from vation is that we are in um a kind of cognitive
development trajectory that we become enculturated we are situated in Social
cultural environments and once that happens we start behaving in ways that not only do
we get the conceptual toolkits the reasoning Etc but we also have access
and contribute and Co construct those social environments from the very
embodied situation that we are at so in a way the biological body constraints
the access and co-construction that you do with the world as well as the social culturally developed embodiment also
plays a role in the participation that you have or not have within the
environment that you navigate now she puts this in terms of uh the living being between it's it's
a condition between freedom and facticity which see how how compatible
this is with what we were saying about push pushing back on the on the second law of Thermodynamics you want to remain
alive but you don't want to remain alive within an encapsulated environment you want to remain alive and do really well
in a social cultural environment which is why we are more than simple vegetation that just wants to leave we
want to live well we want to live good we want to do things that are good for us so we start now entering the realm of
reasons like reasons that we need to give for the things that we do in the ways that we act right so now we start
to become very sophisticated start to get to this like uh mental representation if you will but it
doesn't come for free it's not a commodity we we now we start getting into like season 3 right which is like
things start to get like really interesting so then you can explain um embodied experience as being social
culturally situated that is dependent on the embodiment that you have and that
embodiment that you have is what is going to somehow determine where you are
navigating continuously between freedoms and facticity and she puts it even more
precisely between um agency and
objectification and then you start reasons to how you navigate the social cultural World wonderful yeah yeah it's
the first time I've had s b brought up in intive inference conversation but um
she that that's great uh yeah it's a wonderful segue actually into existentialism and phenomenology and and
we're big fans of mlo Ponte and haiger and draus on this on this podcast as well I thought what you said was
interesting which is that as you as you said correctly the free energy principle is a principle it's like hamiltonian
principle of least action right it's kind of a where it's it's a first principles ontological explanation of
just like what in the case of the FY principle what things have to do if they're going to continue through time
to persist but active inference um or in
certain cases predicted processing or in certain cases computational theories of mind or in certain cases it activat
theories mind are what we call Process theories so it's if we take the free agent principle just to be axiomatically
true in the sense that it's kind of and I think Carl would say this himself it
if you actually put it down to its nuts and bolt it doesn't say too much right it's things do what things have to do to
continue to be the things that they are really and there's a lot of fun maths but it's really about how it's
implemented in us or artificial intelligence or whatever it is um those process theories become
falsifiable so predicted processing might not be the right account of uh continuous St space um active inference
or um perhaps the mind is uh you know fundamentally Downstream on the body in
in a radically embodied way I guess because it's falsifiable um a question that came to
my mind when you were speaking um about activism is and the history as well of cognitive science is as you say there's
very few people who will adopt a radical computational um position these days
daycard John C for example but for cognitive science is very popular right
to put it simply can you envisage a future where for where future science and future
philosophy tell us that viewing the mind as embodied enacted embedded what was
the last one go on Wikipedia um yeah is not the
the right way to view it as we now look back on the computational picture and think it's incomplete yeah okay so I I'm going to
go back to the goggles um it it seems that the ways in so so science is built
on um on First Steps right on the goggles that you put and then you end up
with certain kinds of um theories that now you have and now what would I do
with this I test it I see if it makes sense right in with the case that it doesn't make sense uh we we we don't
know but it is about putting these goggles um and a lot of what is done still in in
cognitive psychology is very daycard is very starting in in season 3 in like
okay minds are mental representation so nobody cares about things that or about
experiments or setting up experiments or thinking or reasoning about how did it come to
be right where we we should put more effort on that how it came to be which
is what by the way dynamical in complex systems theory applied to psychology does that's all they do all they do is
to uh focus on the developmental trajectories to understand how they
evolve and develop how States change into um developing and evolving um and
and much of what is done in cognitive psychology is starting in season 3 is
the the mind is representational and now we got to find that not only in our
cognitive psychology experiments as we put as we as we design our experiments
right is with that assumption in place and that's why this is so dangerous it
may be the case that one is right to think that the mark of the mental is mental
representation but not criticizing it and not having a critical point of view about it what what it means is that
everything that we do within cognitive science science within setting up experiments within setting up
computational models simulations it's going to be starting with the assumption that the mark of the mental is mental
representation and that the brain is an information processing machine so this
is going to be defining for everything that we do and all that I'm saying is that let's take a step back and go to
the beginning of the series as opposed to starting in in in season three and question these things and if they still
make sense great we've done a very good job right so so that's that's the point
of view right and I think that what ecognition the more radical view does is
it takes away that those toys and puts you into okay when you have to start
from the very beginning what do you have and how do you build so it it it puts
things into into pressure on whether that is the case because when you do the bit of the
history of philosophy of mind and you realize that a lot of it has been done
by borrowing conceptual toolkits from computational science then you ask the question what is left for philosophy of
mind is there a philosophy of mind or is there a borrowing conceptual toolkit from computer
science now that is a that's a provocative question I'm not going to I'm not going to try and answer it it it
it's cool the way you talk about the the scientific theories it reminds me we had ma alberon as our second guest and
actually on the day of us calling this the podcast just came out so everyone should definitely go and watch it but we had a long chat about epistemic
communities and the kind of silos that people end up in and that's actually very much akin to what you were saying
that people can really end up stuck in their scientific Paradigm and I'm really hoping that doesn't happen to
me I think it's kind of happening already I mean it makes me think the my
my sort of um philosophy science is not as good as it should be and it should get better but I'm aware of Thomas C in
this idea of the Paradigm the way it sounds to me is that like I don't know I'm adopting a kind of more heelan
perspective where um you got the computational theory of the mind and in activism like radical in activism as
your thesis um and your sort of antithesis and you have this dialectical
relationship right and then what you might end up with is a symphysis and that might I don't know
it's a very broad question but do you see science unfolding in that
or is it kind of more of a incremental Pursuit towards a higher or or getting
closer to truth so um yeah you do have those two different paradigms and I would answer that in in in in in a in a
very clear way I think that all that we have in the computational theory of mind
is our human social culturally situated
experience as a human species best efforts to understand
a phenomenon in the natural world so we develop all this computational Machinery
strategies models Etc because we this is what makes us human we want to
understand the world around us and part of the world around us is human beings
right so then we we have all of that as a reflection or as telling or as a
manifestation of what we can do as a species when we come down to being
epistemic communities and these epistemic communities are and ma was
absolutely right are completely social culturally situated so uh science itself like our
own individual experience of the world does not occure in an encapsulated
manner we could aim for an ideal bird ey
view perspective of being doing science in a way that is completely objective but as
wienstein already told us we don't have that we cannot get out of the trajectory
that brought us here we cannot have access to that other perspective only our own and that is going to be biased
and overlooking that it's dangerous because one would claim that that that
is possible and that's not that's why our best our best um capacity as a human
species is these epistemic communities where we can exchange ideas test ideas
with each other give feedback to each other and improve each other's thinkings and um an experiment such that we
improve in a collective effort that is scientific wonderful I like that it's
spiriting I don't like the idea that we're just stepping on the the toes of our ancestors maybe they did have
something good to tell us and we can build together but maybe never get there because we're blinded in some sense I
mean um obviously where one cannot speak therefore one must be silent um in this
case we could go on forever um I do want to make it clear that your work is
incredibly Broad and diverse and touches on a wonderful range of things so we could have spoken about religion you
have a wonderful paper on religion from an act of inference perspective um autism among other things uh we didn't
even touch upon artificial intelligence agents um so there's going to have to be
around two I suppose it there's where can people find
your work what are you working on what have you got coming out where can people find you because I'm sure they'll want to know more about what you're doing
yeah just on my website that's usually what is updated um which is www. energy
poo.com so usually there you got the links to other places like Publications
Etc and on Twitter as well I'm usually active so anything that comes out uh any
uh conference that I'm organizing participating or papers that are out I always share them on on on my Twitter so
that's usually the places super great okay that's wonderful well it's half
past 11 UK p.m. so I need to need to dash off to bed but this has been an
absolute pleasure um it thank you so much for your time and yeah as I said we should definitely do this again oh thank
you so much what a terrific uh exciting uh uh conversation thank you so much and definitely up for round two well

Important Information And Revision Notes
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track programs (also known as America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF) provide non-dilutive, fixed amount cooperative agreements for the development of a broad range of technologies based on discoveries in science and engineering with the potential for societal and economic impacts.

This new pilot effort shares the same goals as the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II funding opportunities, but the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs have different eligibility requirements. Small businesses applying to the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs must have a lineage of NSF research funding, at least one Senior/Key Personnel to have undergone formal customer discovery training, and the entire team must already be in place (not yet to be determined) at the time of proposal submission. For further information see Eligibility Criteria.

The maximum total SBIR/STTR Fast-Track award amount is $1,555,000 (inclusive of direct and indirect costs, Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) funding, and the small business fee): $400,000 maximum for the Phase I component and $1,155,000 maximum for the Phase II component. The expected project duration will be between 24 months and 36 months. The duration of a Phase I component can be between 6 months and 12 months, to be specified by the company. The duration of a Phase II component can be between 18 months and 24 months, to be specified by the company.

NSF proposals are confidential and will only be shared with a select number of reviewers and NSF staff (as appropriate). All reviewers have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the proposal content. Proposals to NSF do not constitute a public disclosure. If selected for an award, the company will be prompted to write a publicly available abstract that summarizes the intellectual merit and broader impact of the project.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not support clinical trials or proposals from companies whose commercialization pathway involves the production, distribution, or sale by the company of chemical components, natural or synthetic variations thereof, or other derivatives related to Schedule I controlled substances.

All proposals must be submitted through Research.gov.

NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot proposals will not be accepted in Grants.gov. NSF Fast-Track SBIR and STTR pilot proposals are nearly identical but differ in the amount of work performed by the small business and a not-for-profit institution or a Federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) (as noted in the budget). For more details about the unique requirements of NSF STTR Fast-Track pilot awards, please refer to the Eligibility Information and Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions sections of this solicitation.

NSF SBIR Fast-Track Pilot proposals submitted to this solicitation that meet all the requirements of an NSF STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal may, at NSF’s discretion, be converted to NSF STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal for award. Similarly, NSF STTR Fast-Track pilot proposals may be converted to NSF SBIR Fast-Track pilot awards at NSF’s discretion.

America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF is committed to assisting SBIR/STTR Phase II recipients to successfully commercialize their innovation research, grow their company and create jobs by attracting new investments and partnerships. To reinforce these commitments, the programs support a broad number of supplements and other opportunities. For more information, see: Supplemental Funding Overview, and the linked Dear Colleagues Letters.

For the purpose of this solicitation, the following definitions apply:
Funding Agreement: As used in this solicitation, the funding agreement is a Grant – a legal instrument of financial assistance between NSF and a recipient, consistent with 31 USC 6302-6305 and as noted in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Introduction, Section D ("Definitions & NSF-Recipient Relationships").
Small Business Concerns (SBCs): SBCs are independently owned and operated businesses that are not dominant in the field of operation. For this solicitation, firms qualifying as a small business concern are eligible to participate in the SBIR/STTR programs (see Section II. "Eligibility Information" of this solicitation for more details). Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates. The firm must be in compliance with the SBA SBIR/STTR Policy Directive and the Code of Federal Regulations (13 CFR 121).
SBIR/STTR Data: As defined by the SBA SBIR/STTR Policy Directive, SBIR/STTR Data is all Data developed or generated in the performance of an SBIR or STTR award, including Technical Data and Computer Software developed or generated in the performance of an SBIR or STTR award. The term does not include information incidental to contract or grant administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing or management information.
SBIR/STTR Data Rights: The Federal Government may, use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose SBIR/STTR Data that are Technical Data within the Government; however, the Government shall not use, release, or disclose the data for procurement, manufacturing, or commercial purposes; or release or disclose the SBIR/STTR Data outside the Government except as permitted by paragraph 10(B) of the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive's Data Rights Clause or by written permission of the recipient.
Research and Development (R&D): broadly defined in 2 CFR § 200.8, but specified for the NSF SBIR/STTR programs as follows:
the application of creative, original, and potentially transformative concepts to systematically study, create, adapt, or manipulate the structure and behavior of the natural or man-made worlds;
the use of the scientific method to propose well-reasoned, well-organized activities based on sound theory, computation, measurement, observation, experiment, or modeling;
the demonstration of a well-qualified individual, team, or organization ready to deploy novel methods of creating, acquiring, processing, manipulating, storing, or disseminating data or metadata; and/or
the novel integration of new theories, analysis, data, or methods regarding cognition, heuristics, and related phenomena, which can be supported by scientific rationale.
Non-Dilutive Funding: financing that does not involve equity, debt, or other elements of the business ownership structure.
Technical Risk: Technical risk assumes that the possibility of technical failure exists for an envisioned product, service, or solution to be successfully developed. This risk is present even to those suitably skilled in the art of the component, subsystem, method, technique, tool, or algorithm in question. If the new product, service, or solution is successfully realized and brought to the market, it would be difficult for a well-qualified, competing firm to reverse-engineer or otherwise neutralize the competitive advantage generated by leveraging fundamental science or engineering research techniques.
Technological Innovation indicates that the new product or service is differentiated from current products or services; that is, the new technology holds the potential to result in a product or service with a substantial and durable advantage over competing solutions on the market. It also generally provides a barrier to entry for competitors.
The proposal submission system, Research.gov, will stop accepting proposals at 5:00 pm submitting organization’s local time. If your submission is late, you will not be able to submit again until the next deadline. Proposers are strongly urged to submit well in advance of the deadline.

An Intellectual Property (IP) Rights agreement is required for STTR proposals and strongly recommended for SBIR proposals when there is a subaward to another institution. A fully signed agreement is not required for STTR proposals at the initial proposal submission but will be required before a recommendation for an award can be made.

A small business must receive an official invitation via the Project Pitch, a process to submit a full Fast-Track proposal. Details regarding this process as well as how to submit a Fast-Track Project Pitch can be found in Section III.A. of this document. Small businesses that meet the Fast-Track eligibility criteria can submit a Fast-Track Project Pitch at any time. Small businesses that have been invited to submit a full Fast-Track proposal can submit a proposal based on that Project Pitch at any time up to 4 months after the date of the invitation.

In addition to the standard NSF Merit Review Criteria, this solicitation provides additional clarification on how Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact might be applied to startups and small businesses. Additional solicitation-specific merit review criteria focused on Commercialization Potential is also applied.

Summary Of Program Requirements
General Information
Program Title:

NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer Fast-Track Pilot Programs (SBIR-STTR Fast-Track)
Synopsis of Program:

The NSF SBIR/STTR and SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.

These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for the development of a broad range of technologies based on discoveries in science and engineering with potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses. Any invention conceived or reduced to practice with the assistance of SBIR/STTR funding is subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer to SBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75.

NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations.

The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases – Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding – there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology.

There are significant benefits for SBIR/STTR Fast-Track recipients: the submission of only one proposal for Phase I and Phase II and a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II. While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk.

NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics:

The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation.
The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service.
The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible.
The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones).
Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments.
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society.

NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities.

These NSF programs are governed by 15 USC 638 and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC §1861, et seq.).

Introduction to the Program

The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits.

These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submit a single proposal that, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding. Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company’s Phase II transition review.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.

Eligibility Information
Who May Submit Proposals:

Proposals may only be submitted by the following:

Small businesses concerns must meet ALL of the following requirements:

Proposers that have submitted a SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch and received an official invitation from a cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer within the 4 months preceding the proposal submission date. To start this process, proposers must first create a log in and submit a Project Pitch document via the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch online form. The cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer will use the Project Pitch to determine whether the proposed project is a good fit for the Fast-Track program.
Companies qualifying as a small business concern are eligible to participate in the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs (see Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility for more information). Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates. The firm must be in compliance with the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive and the Code of Federal Regulations. For STTR proposals, the proposing small business must also include a partner research institution in the project, see additional details below.
The SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot effort shares the same goals as the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II funding opportunities, but the Fast-Track pilot programs have different eligibility requirements. Small businesses applying to the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs must have 1) a lineage of NSF research funding, 2) at least one Senior/Key Personnel to have undergone formal customer discovery training, and 3) the entire team must already be in place (not yet to be determined) at the time of proposal submission. If the small business concern does not meet all three of these criteria, their proposal will be transferred to the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I program for consideration.
Lineage Eligibility Requirement. The technical innovation in the Fast-Track proposal must be derived from a prior NSF research award that is either currently active or was active within the previous five years from the date of submission of the Fast-Track proposal. The Fast-Track Project Pitch and proposal must include the NSF award number and title of the research award that is relied upon to meet the lineage requirement. The Fast-Track proposal’s PI or at least one Senior/Key Personnel must have been supported under the lineage award. If the Fast-Track team member relied upon to meet the lineage requirement is named on the lineage award, no further documentation will be required. If not, the Fast-Track proposal must include a letter from the PI or a Co-PI of the lineage award confirming that either the PI or a named Senior/Key Personnel on the Fast-Track team was engaged in research undertaken under the lineage award. In addition to regular NSF research awards (e.g., CAREER, individual investigator awards, center/institute awards, etc.), Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) awards do count as NSF lineage for SBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) and NSF SBIR/STTR awards do not count as NSF research lineage and do not convey SBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility.
Formal Customer Discovery Eligibility Requirement. Companies must have received formal customer discovery training, defined as follows, within the previous two years from the date of the Fast-Track proposal submission. At least one of the Senior/Key Personnel on the Fast-Track proposal must have undergone formal customer discovery training in relation to the proposed technology via a suitably qualified program, such as the NSF I-Corps program or a program at an incubator or accelerator, with a result that at the start of the Fast-Track project the proposing company has a clear understanding of the product-market fit and initial target customers for the proposed technology.
Complete Team Eligibility Requirement. Companies must have a complete Fast-Track team in place at the time of proposal submission – i.e., there must be no “to-be-determined” company personnel in budget lines A or B; all company personnel in budget lines A and B must have confirmed their availability for the proposed Fast-Track project per the proposed Phase I and Phase II component budgets; the proposing team must possess the required expertise to perform the proposed Fast-Track project; and the team members must dedicate sufficient time to the technical tasks that must be undertaken to achieve the objectives of the Fast-Track project.
In compliance with the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, Section 10636 (Person or entity of concern prohibition; 42 U.S.C. 19235): No person published on the list under section 1237(b) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) or entity identified under section 1260h of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (10 U.S.C. 113 note; Public Law 116-283) may receive or participate in any grant, award, program, support, or other activity under the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships.
Individuals who are a current party to a Malign Foreign Talent Recruitment Program are not eligible to serve as a Senior/Key Person on an NSF proposal or on any NSF award made after May 20, 2024. See current PAPPG for additional information on required certifications associated with Malign Foreign Talent Organization. The Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) must certify that all individuals identified as Senior/Key Personnel have been made aware of and have complied with their responsibility under that section to certify that the individual is not a party to a Malign Foreign Talent Recruitment Program.
The small business concern’s R&D must be performed within the United States. Startups and small businesses funded by NSF must be majority U.S.-owned companies.
The companies may not be majority-owned by one or more venture capital operating companies (VCOCs), hedge funds, or private equity firms. Proposals from joint ventures and partnerships are permitted, provided the proposing entity qualifies as a small business concern (see Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility for more information).
“Collaborative Proposal from Multiple Organizations” (a special proposal type in Research.gov) are not allowed.
Socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses and women-owned small businesses are also encouraged to apply.
Who May Serve as PI:

The primary employment of the Principal Investigator (PI) must be with the small business concern at the time of award and for the duration of the award, unless a new PI is approved by NSF. Primary employment is defined as at least 51 percent employed by the small business. NSF normally considers a full-time work week to be 40 hours and considers employment elsewhere of greater than 19.6 hours per week to be in conflict with this requirement. The PI must have a legal right to work for the proposing company in the United States, as evidenced by citizenship, permanent residency, or an appropriate visa. The PI does not need to be associated with an academic institution. There are no PI degree requirements (i.e., the PI is not required to hold a Ph.D. or any other degree). A PI must devote a minimum of three calendar months of effort per six months of performance to an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project.

Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization: 1

An organization must wait for a determination from NSF (e.g., award, decline, or returned without review) regarding a pending NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal before submitting a new Project Pitch in the next window.

An organization that has submitted a traditional SBIR/STTR Project Pitch, received an invitation to submit a traditional SBIR/STTR Phase I proposal, or has a traditional SBIR/STTR Phase I proposal under review may not submit a Fast-Track Project Pitch until either the traditional SBIR/STTR Project Pitch has been declined (i.e., not invited) or the outcome of the invited traditional SBIR/STTR proposal submission has been made available to the organization.

Proposals that have been Returned Without Review may be submitted using the same Project Pitch invitation (assuming that the proposal is received within 4 months of the original invitation).

Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or co-PI: 1

For NSF SBIR Fast-Track – 1 PI, co-PIs are not allowed.

For NSF STTR Fast-Track - 1 PI and 1 Co-PI are required (the PI must be an employee of the proposing small business and the Co-PI must be part of the STTR partner research institution). An individual may be listed as the PI for only one proposal submitted at a time to the NSF SBIR/STTR programs (including traditional and Fast-Track).

For NSF STTR Fast-Track proposals, a person may act as co-PI on an unlimited number of proposals.

I. Introduction
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses.

While startups and small businesses face many challenges, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk.

NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics:

The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation.
The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service.
The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible
The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones).
Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments.
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide non-dilutive funding for the development of deep technologies, based on discoveries in fundamental science and engineering, that offer the potential for societal and economic impacts. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for the development of a broad range of technologies based on discoveries in science and engineering with potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses. The NSF SBIR/STTR pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses. The funding provided is non-dilutive and NSF does not receive any stake or interest in the company or in the intellectual property resulting from the funded effort. NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations.

II. Program Description
The aim of the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs is to enable eligible companies (see Section IV of this document) that have a complete R&D team (i.e., no “to-be-determined” team members) to submit a single proposal that, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding. A Fast-Track proposal will include a Phase I component and a Phase II component, each with a corresponding budget. Both Phase I and Phase II components of a Fast-Track proposal will be reviewed prior to the start of a Fast-Track project. On completion of the Phase I component, and contingent upon the results of a company’s Phase II transition review (see below for details), a Fast-Track awardee company will be able to transition directly to the Phase II component of the project. The primary benefits for Fast-Track awardee companies are (i) a pathway at the start of an awarded Fast-Track project to the full funding opportunities of the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II programs, and (ii) a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II than for traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I awardees. Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track programs is contingent upon the success of a company’s Phase II transition review.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs welcome proposals from almost all areas of technology. The program website presents a number of topic areas, but these are only meant to be suggestive of the types of topic areas that are anticipated. The programs are also open to proposals that focus on technical and market areas not explicitly noted in the aforementioned topics. Proposals that do not have an obvious fit in one of the specific topic areas can be submitted to “Other Topics”. NSF encourages eligible companies from all technology sectors and geographic areas to apply for funding. NSF does not test, verify, or otherwise use the technology developed under its SBIR/STTR Fast-Track awards.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are expected to be highly competitive. Only a fraction of proposals submitted will be selected for an award. Thus, there may be many qualified businesses applying to the programs that do not receive funding.

NSF evaluates SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposals under three distinct, but related merit review criteria: Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercialization Potential.

In addition to the standard NSF Merit Review Criteria (Section VI.A.), the following provides additional clarification of how Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact might be applied to startups and small businesses (Section II and IV.A.2).

The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge and leverage fundamental science or engineering research techniques to overcome technical risk. This can be conveyed through the Research and Development (R&D) of the project.

NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposals are evaluated via the concepts of Technical Risk and Technological Innovation. Technical Risk assumes that the possibility of technical failure exists for an envisioned product, service, or solution to be successfully developed. This risk is present even to those suitably skilled in the art of the component, subsystem, method, technique, tool, or algorithm in question. Technological Innovation indicates that the new product or service is differentiated from current products or services; that is, the new technology holds the potential to result in a product or service with a substantial and durable advantage over competing solutions on the market. It also generally provides a barrier to entry for competitors. This means that if the new product, service, or solution is successfully realized and brought to the market, it should be difficult for a well-qualified, competing firm to reverse-engineer or otherwise neutralize the competitive advantage generated by leveraging fundamental science or engineering research techniques.

The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential for the company to drive a benefit to society in terms of addressing major societal challenges. Considering the products developed under these programs will have a broad societal reach, will be widely distributed, and will therefore have impacts that are far reaching with people and communities. It is important to ensure adequate assessment of potential benefits and unintended consequences of the proposed technology.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the vision of the NSF, which is a nation that leads the world in science and engineering research and innovation to the benefit of all, without barriers to participation. Proposers may also consider the Broader Impacts Review Criterion at 42 U.S.C. §1862p-14 as related to the potential for broadest societal impact.

An additional, solicitation-specific merit review criteria focused on Commercialization Potential is also required. The Commercialization Potential of the proposed product or service is the potential for the resulting technology to disrupt the targeted market segment by way of a strong and durable value proposition for the customers or users.

The proposed product or service addresses an unmet, important, and scalable need for the target customer base.
The proposed small business is structured and staffed to focus on aggressive commercialization of the product/service.
The proposed small business can provide evidence of good product-market fit (as validated by direct and significant interaction with customers and related stakeholders).
More details and information regarding the NSF SBIR/STTR merit review criteria can be found in Section VI.A of this solicitation and the NSF SBIR/STTR website.

The review of an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal includes both the Phase I and Phase II components of the proposal. A team submitting an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal must have NSF-funded research lineage (see Section IV); customer discovery training in order to develop an understanding of the target market, product-market fit and initial target customers; and a complete team (no “to-be-determined” members).

The Phase I and Phase II components of an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal will be reviewed and evaluated separately. For cases in which reviewers and the cognizant Program Officer deem that the Phase I component is meritorious, but the Phase II component is not, the Program Officer may consider recommending the Fast-Track proposal for a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award. The company would subsequently be eligible to apply for NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II funding via the traditional process (i.e., not via the Fast-Track process).

An NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal must include specific, quantifiable performance targets for the Phase I component of the project. These Phase I targets may be renegotiated with the cognizant Program Officer during post-review diligence, so that at the start of the Fast-Track project there will be agreed performance targets in place for the Phase I component.

Phase II Transition Review: The Phase II transition review will consist of two stage gates:

Stage Gate 1: Progress Evaluation.

Approximately three (3) months prior to the end of the Phase I component, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track recipient will be required to participate in a reverse site visit during which they will present to NSF the results of the Phase I project to date. Detailed guidance regarding the reverse site visit will be provided to the recipient four to six weeks prior to the reverse site visit. NSF will evaluate progress made by the Fast-Track recipient company during the Phase I component, taking into account a number of factors including, but not limited to:

Phase I performance compared with the agreed performance targets;
commercial progress and commercial traction during Phase I;
team suitability for Phase II; and
additional resources – including company personnel, advisors, and funding that are accessible to the company for technical, regulatory, or commercial activities associated with the Phase II component.
Based on the results of NSF’s SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Stage Gate 1 review, if NSF determines, based on this progress evaluation, that a Fast-Track award recipient should have the opportunity to transition to the Phase II component, the company will advance to Stage Gate 2.

Alternatively, NSF may decide that an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track award will not transition to the Phase II component. In such cases, the Fast-Track project will be limited to Phase I funding, and the award will conclude at the end of the Phase I component. NSF will communicate its decision and rationale back to the Fast-Track awardee. The company will not be eligible to apply for regular SBIR/STTR Phase II funding based on the Fast-Track award. NOTE: NSF’s decision not to provide SBIR/STTR Phase II funding following Stage Gate 1 is not subject to reconsideration or termination review as defined in Chapter XII.A.4 of the PAPPG.

Stage Gate 2: CAP Review

NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track award recipients who progress beyond the Stage Gate 1 will be required to prepare and submit administrative and supporting financial documentation for review by the NSF Cost Analysis and Pre-Award (CAP) Branch. See https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/caar/sbirrev.jsp for detailed requirements. CAP reviews are conducted to evaluate a prospective recipient's ability to manage a federal award effectively and efficiently, as well as to establish the reasonableness of the dollar amount for the Phase II component of the award. Based on the results of the Stage Gate 2 review, NSF may decide that a Fast-Track award will not receive additional Phase II funding, and the award will conclude at the end of the Phase I component. NSF will communicate its decision and rationale back to the Fast-Track recipient. The company will not be allowed to apply for regular SBIR/STTR Phase II funding based on the Fast-Track award. NOTE: NSF’s decision not to provide SBIR/STTR Phase II funding following Stage Gate 2 is not subject to reconsideration or termination review as defined in Chapter XII.A.4 of the PAPPG.

Companies who pass both Stage Gates 1 and 2 will receive a funding increment for the Phase II component of the award, and they will be eligible to apply for the same Phase II supplemental funding opportunities as are available to a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II awardee.

IV. Eligibility Information
Who May Submit Proposals:

Proposals may only be submitted by the following:

Small businesses concerns must meet ALL of the following requirements:

Proposers that have submitted a SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch and received an official invitation from a cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer within the 4 months preceding the proposal submission date. To start this process, proposers must first create a log in and submit a Project Pitch document via the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch online form. The cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer will use the Project Pitch to determine whether the proposed project is a good fit for the Fast-Track program.
Companies qualifying as a small business concern are eligible to participate in the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs (see Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility for more information). Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates. The firm must be in compliance with the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive and the Code of Federal Regulations. For STTR proposals, the proposing small business must also include a partner research institution in the project, see additional details below.
The SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot effort shares the same goals as the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I and Phase II funding opportunities, but the Fast-Track pilot programs have different eligibility requirements. Small businesses applying to the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs must have 1) a lineage of NSF research funding, 2) at least one Senior/Key Personnel to have undergone formal customer discovery training, and 3) the entire team must already be in place (not yet to be determined) at the time of proposal submission. If the small business concern does not meet all three of these criteria, their proposal will be transferred to the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I program for consideration.
Lineage Eligibility Requirement. The technical innovation in the Fast-Track proposal must be derived from a prior NSF research award that is either currently active or was active within the previous five years from the date of submission of the Fast-Track proposal. The Fast-Track Project Pitch and proposal must include the NSF award number and title of the research award that is relied upon to meet the lineage requirement. The Fast-Track proposal’s PI or at least one Senior/Key Personnel must have been supported under the lineage award. If the Fast-Track team member relied upon to meet the lineage requirement is named on the lineage award, no further documentation will be required. If not, the Fast-Track proposal must include a letter from the PI or a Co-PI of the lineage award confirming that either the PI or a named Senior/Key Personnel on the Fast-Track team was engaged in research undertaken under the lineage award. In addition to regular NSF research awards (e.g., CAREER, individual investigator awards, center/institute awards, etc.), Partnerships for Innovation (PFI) and NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) awards do count as NSF lineage for SBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) and NSF SBIR/STTR awards do not count as NSF research lineage and do not convey SBIR/STTR Fast-Track eligibility.
Formal Customer Discovery Eligibility Requirement. Companies must have received formal customer discovery training, defined as follows, within the previous two years from the date of the Fast-Track proposal submission. At least one of the Senior/Key Personnel on the Fast-Track proposal must have undergone formal customer discovery training in relation to the proposed technology via a suitably qualified program, such as the NSF I-Corps program or a program at an incubator or accelerator, with a result that at the start of the Fast-Track project the proposing company has a clear understanding of the product-market fit and initial target customers for the proposed technology.
Complete Team Eligibility Requirement. Companies must have a complete Fast-Track team in place at the time of proposal submission – i.e., there must be no “to-be-determined” company personnel in budget lines A or B; all company personnel in budget lines A and B must have confirmed their availability for the proposed Fast-Track project per the proposed Phase I and Phase II component budgets; the proposing team must possess the required expertise to perform the proposed Fast-Track project; and the team members must dedicate sufficient time to the technical tasks that must be undertaken to achieve the objectives of the Fast-Track project.
In compliance with the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, Section 10636 (Person or entity of concern prohibition; 42 U.S.C. 19235): No person published on the list under section 1237(b) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) or entity identified under section 1260h of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (10 U.S.C. 113 note; Public Law 116-283) may receive or participate in any grant, award, program, support, or other activity under the Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships.
Individuals who are a current party to a Malign Foreign Talent Recruitment Program are not eligible to serve as a Senior/Key Person on an NSF proposal or on any NSF award made after May 20, 2024. See current PAPPG for additional information on required certifications associated with Malign Foreign Talent Organization. The Authorized Organizational Representative (AOR) must certify that all individuals identified as Senior/Key Personnel have been made aware of and have complied with their responsibility under that section to certify that the individual is not a party to a Malign Foreign Talent Recruitment Program.
The small business concern’s R&D must be performed within the United States. Startups and small businesses funded by NSF must be majority U.S.-owned companies.
The companies may not be majority-owned by one or more venture capital operating companies (VCOCs), hedge funds, or private equity firms. Proposals from joint ventures and partnerships are permitted, provided the proposing entity qualifies as a small business concern (see Guide to SBIR/STTR Program Eligibility for more information).
“Collaborative Proposal from Multiple Organizations” (a special proposal type in Research.gov) are not allowed.
Socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses and women-owned small businesses are also encouraged to apply.
Who May Serve as PI:

The primary employment of the Principal Investigator (PI) must be with the small business concern at the time of award and for the duration of the award, unless a new PI is approved by NSF. Primary employment is defined as at least 51 percent employed by the small business. NSF normally considers a full-time work week to be 40 hours and considers employment elsewhere of greater than 19.6 hours per week to be in conflict with this requirement. The PI must have a legal right to work for the proposing company in the United States, as evidenced by citizenship, permanent residency, or an appropriate visa. The PI does not need to be associated with an academic institution. There are no PI degree requirements (i.e., the PI is not required to hold a Ph.D. or any other degree). A PI must devote a minimum of three calendar months of effort per six months of performance to an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project.

Limit on Number of Proposals per Organization: 1

An organization must wait for a determination from NSF (e.g., award, decline, or returned without review) regarding a pending NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal before submitting a new Project Pitch in the next window.

An organization that has submitted a traditional SBIR/STTR Project Pitch, received an invitation to submit a traditional SBIR/STTR Phase I proposal, or has a traditional SBIR/STTR Phase I proposal under review may not submit a Fast-Track Project Pitch until either the traditional SBIR/STTR Project Pitch has been declined (i.e., not invited) or the outcome of the invited traditional SBIR/STTR proposal submission has been made available to the organization.

Proposals that have been Returned Without Review may be submitted using the same Project Pitch invitation (assuming that the proposal is received within 4 months of the original invitation).

Limit on Number of Proposals per PI or co-PI: 1

For NSF SBIR Fast-Track – 1 PI, co-PIs are not allowed.

For NSF STTR Fast-Track - 1 PI and 1 Co-PI are required (the PI must be an employee of the proposing small business and the Co-PI must be part of the STTR partner research institution). An individual may be listed as the PI for only one proposal submitted at a time to the NSF SBIR/STTR programs (including traditional and Fast-Track).

For NSF STTR Fast-Track proposals, a person may act as co-PI on an unlimited number of proposals.

Additional Eligibility Info:

Required Project Pitch Invitation: Potential proposers must receive an invitation to submit a full NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal. Please see Project Pitch website for details.

STTR Research Institution. The SBIR/STTR Policy Directive requires that STTR proposals include an eligible research institution as a subawardee on the project budget. The STTR partner research institution is typically either a not-for-profit institution focused on scientific or educational goals (such as a college or university), or a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC). For an NSF STTR Fast-Track proposal, a minimum of 40% of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business concern, and a minimum of 30% must be performed by a single partner research institution, with the balance permitted to be allocated to either of these, or to other subawards or consultants.

Partnering. Proposing companies are encouraged to collaborate with experienced researchers at available facilities such as colleges, universities, national laboratories, and from other research sites. Funding for such collaborations may include research subawards or consulting agreements. The employment of faculty and students by the small business is allowed, however:

For an NSF SBIR Fast-Track proposal, a minimum of two-thirds of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business during the Phase I component of the project, and a minimum of one-half of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business during the Phase II component of the project. The balance of the budget may be outsourced to subawards or consultants or a combination thereof. The proportion requirements cited above must be met in both the Phase I and Phase II budgets independently.
For an NSF STTR Fast-Track proposal, the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive requires proposals to include an eligible research institution as a subawardee on the project budget. The institution is typically either a not-for-profit institution focused on scientific or educational goals (such as a college or university), or a Federally funded research and development center (FFRDC). A minimum of 40% of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business. A minimum of 30% must be performed by a single partner research institution. The balance (remaining 30%) may be allocated to the small business, partner research institution, or to other subawards or consultants. The percentage requirements cited above must be met in both the Phase I and Phase II budgets independently.
For Both SBIR and STTR Fast-Track proposals, proposals should NOT be marked as a "Collaborative Proposal from Multiple Organizations" during submission.
Companies are allowed to switch between SBIR and STTR, and vice versa, as they transition from Phase I to Phase II.
Government-Wide Required Benchmarks (applies to previous SBIR/STTR recipients only):

Phase I to Phase II Transition Rate Benchmark. For Phase I proposers that have received more than 20 Phase I SBIR/STTR awards from any federal agency over the past five fiscal years, the minimum Phase I to Phase II Transition Rate over that period is 25%. Small businesses that fail to meet this transition requirement will be notified by the Small Business Administration and will not be eligible to submit a Phase I proposal for one (1) year.
Commercialization Benchmark (applies to previous SBIR/STTR recipients only). The commercialization benchmark required by the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 only applies to proposers that have received more than 15 Phase II Federal SBIR/STTR awards over the past 10 fiscal years, excluding the last two years. These companies must have achieved the minimum required commercialization activity to be eligible to submit a Phase I proposal, as determined by the information entered in the company registry, see Completing the Company Registry Commercialization Report: Instructions and Definitions.
For more information, see Performance Benchmark Requirements.
V. Proposal Preparation And Submission Instructions
A. Proposal Preparation Instructions
Full Proposal Instructions: Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation should be prepared and submitted in accordance with the guidelines specified in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG). The complete text of the PAPPG is available electronically on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg. Paper copies of the PAPPG may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-8134 or by e-mail from nsfpubs@nsf.gov.

See PAPPG Chapter II.D.2 for guidance on the required sections of a full research proposal submitted to NSF. Please note that the proposal preparation instructions provided in this program solicitation may deviate from the PAPPG instructions.

This solicitation contains MANY instructions that deviate from the standard NSF PAPPG proposal preparation instructions. This solicitation contains the information needed to prepare and submit a proposal and refers to specific sections of the PAPPG ONLY when necessary (and noted throughout the solicitation). In the event of conflict between the instructions in this solicitation and the PAPPG, use this solicitation's instructions as a guide.

The following project activities are not responsive to the solicitation:

Evolutionary development or incremental modification of established products or proven concepts;
Straightforward engineering or test and optimization efforts that are not hypothesis driven;
Evaluation or testing of existing products;
Basic scientific research or research not connected to any specific market opportunity or potential new product;
Business development, market research, and sales and marketing;
Clinical trials;
Research or commercialization pathways involving chemical components, natural or synthetic variations thereof, or other derivatives related to Schedule I controlled substances; or
Non-profit business concerns.
Non-responsive proposals may be returned without review.

An NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot proposal that is Returned Without Review as being not responsive to the solicitation may be significantly revised and submitted for the next deadline if the proposal is still within the timeframe for eligible submission.

Required Project Pitch submission: To submit a full NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal, potential proposers must first submit a Project Pitch and receive an invitation. The Project Pitch gives NSF the ability to review for appropriateness to the NSF STTR/STTR Fast-Track programs prior to the full proposal submission process, ensuring that proposers do not expend time or resources preparing full proposals that are not aligned with the program requirements. To start this process, proposers must first create a log-in and submit a Project Pitch via the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch online form. NSF SBIR/STTR program staff will use the Project Pitch to determine whether the proposed project is a good fit for the program objectives.

All NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitches MUST be submitted to “Fast-Track” using the drop-down on the site and MUST nominate the most appropriate technical topic area from the list,
Proposers may submit a Project Pitch at any time, regardless of the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot solicitation window.
Proposers must include their prior NSF award number (NSF lineage) in the Project Pitch.
When submitting an SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal in Research.gov, you must enter your invited SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Project Pitch Number in the SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Questionnaire. The Phase I award number must be validated before you can continue with the proposal preparation.
REQUIRED REGISTRATIONS: Small businesses applying for NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding must be registered in the following systems in order to submit a proposal to NSF. The registrations below can take several weeks or even months to process, so please start early.

You must register your company name, physical address, and all other identifying information identically in each of these systems. We recommend that you register your small business in the following order:

System for Award Management (SAM) Registration. You MUST register to do business with the U.S. government through SAM. When you register, you will have to share bank account information of the account where the NSF funds would be deposited. This registration process is free and must be renewed annually. An active SAM.gov registration and its associated SAM.gov Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) is needed to create a Research.gov account and submit a proposal to NSF. To submit proposals to NSF SBIR/STTR, you only need to request "financial assistance" authority and do NOT need "contract" authority (which can be a much longer process to obtain).
NSF will validate that each proposer’s UEI and SAM registration are valid and active prior to allowing submission of a proposal to NSF. If a registration is not active, an organization will not be able to submit a proposal. Additionally, if the SAM registration is not renewed annually and is not valid, NSF will block any award approval actions.
Any subawardees or subcontractors are also required to obtain a UEI and register in Research.gov. Entities can obtain a SAM UEI without full SAM registration. If you have a subrecipient that is not fully registered in SAM, but has been assigned a UEI number, please call the IT Help desk for further assistance.
Small Business Administration (SBA) Company Registration. A Small Business Concern Identification number (SBC ID) is required prior to submission of the proposal. SBA maintains and manages the Company Registry for SBIR/STTR proposers in order to track ownership and affiliation requirements. All SBCs must report ownership information prior to each SBIR/STTR proposal submission and update the SBC if any information changes prior to award. This registration process is free.
Research.gov. Research.gov is NSF’s online grant management system – how you submit your proposal. For more information, consult the "About Account Management" page. This registration process is free.
Beware of scammers charging fees for SAM and/or SBA registrations.

Other Federal Agencies (if applicable). If this proposal is being submitted to other Federal agencies, state or local governments, or non-governmental entities, enter a reasonable abbreviation, up to 10 characters, for each agency or entity. Only the first 5 agencies you enter will appear on the PDF version of the proposal, but all should be entered below. IT IS ILLEGAL TO ACCEPT DUPLICATE FUNDING FOR THE SAME WORK. IF A PROPOSER FAILS TO DISCLOSE EQUIVALENT OR OVERLAPPING PROPOSALS, THE PROPOSER COULD BE LIABLE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL, AND/OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

Human Subjects (if applicable). According to 45 CFR 46, a human subject is "a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:

Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or
Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens.”
NIH provides a Decision Tool to assist investigators in determining whether their project involves non-exempt human subjects research, meetings the criteria for exempt human subjects research, or does not involve human subjects research.

Projects involving research with human subjects must ensure that subjects are protected from research risks in conformance with the relevant Federal policy known as the Common Rule (Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, 45 CFR 690). All projects involving human subjects must either (1) have approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before issuance of an NSF award; or (2) must obtain a statement from the IRB indicating research exemption from IRB review; or 3) must obtain a just in time IRB designation and documentation. This documentation needs to be completed during due diligence discussions, in accordance with the applicable subsection, as established in section 101(b) of the Common Rule. If certification of exemption is provided after submission of the proposal and before the award is issued, the exemption number corresponding to one or more of the exemption categories also must be included in the documentation provided to NSF. The small business has three basic options with regard to human subjects review:

Establish your own IRB (see Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/irbs-and-assurances.html#registernew.
Use the review board of a (usually local) university or research institution, either via consultants to the project, a project subaward, or directly through its own contacts;
Use a commercial provider.
For projects lacking definite plans for the use of human subjects, their data, or their specimens, pursuant to 45 CFR § 690.118, NSF can accept a determination notice that establishes a limited time period under which the PI may conduct preliminary or conceptual work that does not involve human subjects. See more information and instructions regarding this documentation in the PAPPG.

Live Vertebrate Animals (if applicable). Any project proposing use of vertebrate animals for research or education shall comply with the Animal Welfare Act (7 USC 2131, et seq.) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture (9 CFR 1 .1 -4.11) pertaining to the humane care, handling, and treatment of vertebrate animals held or used for research, teaching or other activities supported by Federal awards.

In accordance with these requirements, proposed projects involving use of any vertebrate animal for research or education must be approved by the submitting organization's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before an award can be made. For this approval to be accepted by NSF, the organization must have a current Public Health Service (PHS) Approved Assurance. See also PAPPG for additional information on the administration of awards that utilize vertebrate animals. This documentation must be completed before issuance of an NSF award.

SBIR (or STTR) Fast-Track Questionnaire. The SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Questionnaire MUST be filled in completely including Topic and Subtopic, Project Pitch Number, Authorized Company Officer Information, Proposing Small Business Information, SBIR/STTR Award History, Affiliated Companies, and Other Information (including NSF Funding Lineage).

Other Information.

Proprietary Information. To the extent permitted by law, the Government will not release properly identified and marked technical and commercially sensitive data.

If the proposal does not contain proprietary information, uncheck the box in the Phase I Questionnaire.

If the proposal does contain proprietary information identify the proprietary technical data by clearly marking the information and also providing a legend. NSF SBIR/STTR data, including proposals, are protected from disclosure by the participating agencies for not less than 20 years from the delivery of the last report or proposal associated with the given project. Typically, proprietary information is identified in the text either with an asterisk at the beginning and end of the proprietary paragraph, underlining the proprietary sections, or choosing a different font type. An entire proposal should not be marked proprietary.

For Statistical Purposes. Please check all of the appropriate boxes and fill in award numbers as needed.

SBIR (or STTR) Fast-Track Certification Questions. The Fast-Track Certification Questions MUST be filled in completely.

Project Summary. One (1) page MAXIMUM]. The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative to other persons working in the same or related fields, and insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal. Do not include proprietary information in the summary.

The Project Summary is completed in Research.gov by entering information into the three text boxes in the Project Summary. To be valid, a heading must be on its own line with no other text on that line.

Overview: Describe the potential outcome(s) of the proposed activity in terms of a product, process, or service. Provide a list of key words or phrases that identify the areas of technical expertise to be invoked in reviewing the proposal and the areas of application that are the initial target of the technology. Provide the subtopic name.
Intellectual Merit: This section MUST begin with “This Small Business Innovation Research (or Small Business Technology Transfer) Fast-Track project...” Address the intellectual merits of the proposed activity. Briefly describe the technical hurdle(s) that will be addressed by the proposed R&D (which should be crucial to successful commercialization of the innovation), the goals of the proposed R&D, and a high-level summary of the plan to reach those goals.
Broader Impacts and Commercial Potential: Discuss the expected outcomes in terms of how the proposed project will bring the innovation closer to commercialization under a sustainable business model. In this box, also describe the potential commercial and market impacts that such a commercialization effort would have, if successful. Also discuss potential broader societal and economic impacts of the innovation (e.g., educational, environmental, scientific, societal, or other impacts on the nation and the world).
Project Description. Ten (10) pages MINIMUM and fifteen (15) pages MAXIMUM). The project description is the core of the proposal document, where the PI convinces the expert reviewers/panelists and NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer that their proposed R&D project meets NSF’s criteria for Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercialization Potential. Note: The incorporation of URLs or websites within the Project Description is not acceptable and the proposal may not be accepted or will be Returned without Review.

The Project Description for a Fast-Track proposal is divided into the following sections:

Fast-Track Phase I R&D Plan – 4 pages MAXIMUM; duration between 6 months and 12 months (specified by the proposing small business).
Succinctly describe the proposed technical innovation, highlighting those aspects that are innovative and transformative relative to the current state of the art. Describe the innovation in sufficient technical detail for a knowledgeable reviewer to understand why it is innovative and how it can provide benefits in the target applications.
Describe the primary technical risks associated with developing the proposed innovation and the key technical objectives to be accomplished during Phase I, clearly explaining why these technical objectives are commercially relevant.
Provide an R&D plan to achieve the key Phase I technical objectives, along with a corresponding timeline. The R&D plan must leverage fundamental science or engineering research and techniques. Associated with this R&D plan, provide a set of clear, quantitative Phase I technical performance targets. Note that these performance targets, if met, must be sufficient to establish or strongly suggest technical viability of the proposed technology, although it is recognized that substantial further development work will likely be needed to generate a commercial product or service.
If the project involves subawards, explain why the subawardee(s) is(are) appropriate partners and describe the intended outcomes of the subawards.
Fast-Track Phase II R&D Plan – 5 pages MAXIMUM; duration between 18 months and 24 months (specified by the proposing small business)
Describe the technical performance metrics that you will need to achieve in order to develop (i) a minimum viable product or service, and (ii) a first-generation commercial-grade product or service. Describe the intended technical outcomes of the Phase II component of the project in terms of these two stages of development, clearly explaining how far you plan to progress towards a commercial solution during Phase II.
Describe the major non-commercial hurdles that will need to be overcome to achieve the above Phase II technical outcomes.
Provide a detailed R&D plan to transition the Phase I results into the intended Phase II technical outcomes described above, along with a corresponding timeline.
Clearly describe any security and privacy practices or standards, regulatory requirements, or other industry standards or practices that the proposed technology will need to comply with in order to be widely adopted and explain how you will ensure that the technology is compliant.

Describe how you expect to expand the team going into Phase II and present a rationale for the team changes relative to Phase I. In your response include a discussion of Phase II team members who will not be supported by NSF funds.
Commercialization Plan – 5 pages MAXIMUM. The Commercialization Plan is a critical section of the proposal. It is the primary opportunity to describe the strategy that the small business will employ to generate revenue from the proposed innovation research. The Commercialization Plan is the company's roadmap and should convey how the company will generate profits from its innovation. It should represent a compelling vision of a unique business opportunity.
Describe the target market (including the size and geography of the target market) and initial target customer(s), with examples where possible.
Describe results of ongoing customer discovery activities to date. Provide supporting data if possible.
Clearly describe the proposed product or service, and how it will be delivered to the target customers.

Broader Impacts – 1 page MAXIMUM
Describe how the proposed product or service offers the potential for broader societal impacts as well as economic benefit (through commercialization under a sustainable business model). Examples of such outcomes may include (but are not limited to) those found in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (P.L. 114-329, Section 102) Broader Impacts Review Criterion.
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs fund the development of new, high-risk technology innovations intended to generate positive societal outcomes. Discuss the envisioned broader impacts and the specific implementation plan, including: the relevant metrics and measurement plan; potential partners; potential risks and associated mitigation strategies; and additional anticipated needs for resources and the plan to secure them.
References Cited. Provide a comprehensive listing of relevant references, including websites or relevant URLs, patent numbers, and other relevant intellectual property citations. If there are no references, include a statement to that effect.

Budget(s) and Budget Justification(s). Proposers are required to submit budgets with their proposals, including specific dollar amounts by budget category. Proposers must submit a written justification explaining these amounts in detail. NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officers review these proposed budgets and rely on them in determining the final amount awarded for a given SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project. Enter budget figures for each project year into Research.gov. The system will automatically generate a cumulative budget for the entire project.

Detailed documentation of all budget line items is required and MUST be documented in detail on the Budget Justification. The budget should reflect the needs of the proposed R&D project. The maximum total budget shall not exceed $1,555,000: $400,000 for the Phase I component and $1,155,000 for the Phase II component.

IMPORTANT: The budget and budget justification for the Phase I component of the proposed SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project must be uploaded to the year 1 budget in Research.gov, while the Phase II component of the proposed Fast-Track project must be uploaded to the year 2 and year 3 budget in Research.gov.

The Budget Justification must be uploaded to the Research.gov Budget as a single PDF with two distinct sections – one section for the Phase I component of the Fast-Track project budget and one for the Phase II component. For each component, provide details for each non-zero line item of the budget, including a description and cost estimates. Identify each line item by its letter (e.g., A. Senior/Key Personnel). There is a five-page limit for the Budget Justification. Each Subaward Budget Justification, where required, also has a five-page limit. Additional information to help prepare your proposal budget is available here. The Budget Justification must also clearly state the expected duration of the corresponding Phase I or Phase II project component.

You can add Subaward Organization(s) to your proposal (required for STTR submissions and allowed for SBIR submissions), and make changes to personnel information by navigating to the Budget “Manage Personnel and Subaward Organizations” tab.

All activities on an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot project, including services that are provided by consultants, must be carried out in the United States ("United States" means the 50 states, the territories and possessions of the U.S. Federal Government, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau).Based on a rare and unique circumstance, agencies may approve a particular portion of the R/R&D work to be performed or obtained in a country outside of the United States, for example, if a supply or material or other item or project requirement is not available in the United States. The Funding Agreement officer must approve each such specific condition in writing.

Guidelines for the budget and budget justification follows.

Line A – Senior/Key Personnel. List the PI, co-PI (if STTR), and Senior/Key Personnel by name, their time commitments (in calendar months), and the dollar amount requested. Only salaries and wages for employees of the proposing organization should be included on Line A. Research effort is to be estimated in “Months” (1 Month = 173 hours). Months do not include paid time off and represents actual effort that will be dedicated to the project. The PI must be budgeted for a minimum of three calendar months of effort per six months of performance to the proposed NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project.

In the Budget Justification provide the name; title; a brief description of responsibilities for the PI, co-PI (if STTR), and each of the Senior/Key Personnel as well as the annual, monthly, or hourly salary rate; time commitment; and a calculation of the total requested salary.

You can add additional senior/key personnel to your proposal (e.g., for STTR submissions), and make changes to personnel information by navigating to the Budget “Manage Personnel and Subaward Organizations” tab.

The best source for determining an appropriate salary request is the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In the Budget Justification provide the title; annual, monthly, or hourly salary rate; time commitment; a calculation of the total requested salary; and a description of responsibilities for the PI, co-PI (if STTR), and each of the Senior/Key Personnel.

You can add additional senior/key personnel to your proposal (e.g., for STTR submissions), and make changes to personnel information by navigating to the "Manage Personnel and Subaward Organizations" page.

Line B - Other Personnel. List the number of people, months, and funding for additional personnel: Other Professionals (Technicians, Programmers, etc.), Administrative/Clerical, and/or Other. These personnel must be employed at the proposing company. The budget justification should state individual employee names and titles (to the extent known), expected role in the project, effort in months and annual salary for each person.

Postdoctoral scholars and students (undergraduate and graduate) are generally listed on a subaward budget to a research institution. If they are employees of the company, they may be listed in Line A. Senior/Key Personnel (Line A), or Line B. Other Professionals or Other, as appropriate.

Secretarial/clerical effort is generally included as part of indirect costs. Salaries for secretarial/clerical should be budgeted as a direct cost only if this type of cost is consistently treated as a direct cost in like circumstances for all other project and cost objectives.
Line C - Fringe Benefits. It is recommended that proposers allot funds for fringe benefits here ONLY if the proposer's usual (established) accounting practices provide that fringe benefits be treated as direct costs. If Fringe Benefits are included on Line C, describe what is included in fringe benefits and the calculations that were used to arrive at the amount requested.

Otherwise, fringe benefits should be included in Line I. Indirect Costs.

Line D - Equipment. Equipment is defined as non-expendable, tangible personal property, having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. However, organizations may elect to establish their capitalization threshold as less than $5,000. Equipment should be budgeted consistently with the proposing organization's capitalization policy. Requests should not be made for general purpose or routine equipment that a business conducting research in the field should be expected to have available. The budget justification must explain the need for any equipment and include the item identification/description, vendor identification, quantity, price, and extended amount. The budget justification should also include, as a separate document if needed, pricing documentation (e.g., quotes, invoices, links to online price lists, past purchase orders, etc.) for each budgeted piece of equipment.

Note that the purchase of Equipment may NOT be included in the budget of the Phase I component of a Fast-Track proposal (Year 1), but MAY be included in the budget of the Phase II component of a Fast-Track proposal (Years 2 and 3).

Line E - Travel. NSF requires that the PI budget travel (for the first year of the project only) to attend the NSF SBIR/STTR Awardee Workshop. A good estimate for the Awardee Workshop is $2,000 per person and is limited to $4,000 per year. Other than the Awardee Workshop and funds for Technical And Business Assistance (TABA, see below), all budgeted travel must be directly related to the execution of the research effort. Only domestic travel will be considered.

The Budget Justification must include the purpose for domestic travel and, for each budgeted trip: the destination, purpose of travel, number of days, and the estimated costs for airfare, cab fare, car rental, per diem rates, hotel, and other incidentals. No supporting detail is required for attendance at the Awardee Workshop at $2,000 (or less) per person. If the workshop is organized as virtual only, proposers can (if awarded) reallocate these funds towards other project activities, pending the approval of the cognizant SBIR/STTR Program Officer.

Travel for purposes other than the project R&D effort (e.g., marketing, customer engagements) is not permitted in the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track budget.

Foreign travel expenses are NOT permitted.

Line F - Participant Support Costs. Participant support costs are NOT permitted on an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track budget.

Line G. Other Direct Costs.

Materials and Supplies. Materials and supplies are defined as tangible personal property, other than equipment, costing less than $5,000, or other lower threshold consistent with the policy established by the proposing organization. The Budget Justification should indicate the specifics of the materials and supplies required, including an itemized listing with item/description, vendor, unit cost, quantity, price, and extended amount. Items with a total cost exceeding $5,000 may require pricing documentation (e.g., quote, link to online price list, prior purchase order or invoice) after the proposal is reviewed, as part of the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer's due diligence efforts. Please see Section VI. for details.

Publication Costs/Documentation/Distrib. Publication, documentation and distribution costs are not allowed.

Consultant Services. Consultant services include specialized work that will be performed by professionals that are not employees of the proposing small business. All consultant activities must be carried out in the United States (see above).

No person who is an equity holder, employee, or officer of the proposing small business may be paid as a consultant unless an exception is recommended by the cognizant SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer and approved by the Division Director of Translational Impacts (TI).

The proposal must include a signed agreement (Letter of Commitment) from each consultant confirming the services to be provided (role in the project), primary organizational affiliation, number of days committed to the research effort, availability to provide services, and consulting daily rate. The agreement must clearly state the number of days on the project, the consulting daily rate (8 hours/day) and the total dollar amount of the consulting agreement. Include a copy of the signed Letter of Commitment in the "Other Supplementary Documents" section. Multiple letters should be combined as a single PDF before uploading.

The consulting daily rate represents the total labor compensation for an 8-hour period and may not exceed $1,000 per day. Any miscellaneous costs, such as supplies, that are not included as part of the daily rate must be identified and justified. Consultant travel should be shown under the domestic travel category, Line E, but counts as an outsourcing expense for the purpose of determining whether the small business concern meets the minimum level of effort for an NSF SBIR/STTR proposal. Any information above and beyond the above will be considered not responsive and may be removed from your proposal.

Biographical sketches for each consultant may be requested by the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer after the proposal is reviewed, as part of their due diligence efforts. Please see Section VI. for details.

Computer Services. This line can include funds for fee-for-service computing activities or resources (such as supercomputer time, cloud services, etc.). Any extended line item should be accompanied by pricing documentation (e.g., quote, link to online price list, prior purchase order, or invoice) in the budget justification. Requested services with a total cost exceeding $5,000 may require pricing documentation (e.g., quote, link to online price list, prior purchase order or invoice) after the proposal is reviewed, as part of the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer's due diligence efforts.

Subaward(s). Subawards may be utilized when a significant portion of the work is performed by another organization and when the work to be done is not widely commercially available. Work performed by a university or research laboratory is one example of a common subaward.

Subawards require a separate subaward budget and subaward budget justification, in the same format as the main budget. To enter a subaward budget in Research.gov, go to the Budget module tab and add Subaward Organization(s) by opening the “Manage Personnel and Subaward Organizations” tab. Each subawardee will have its own budget pages for each year of the project.

A subawardee research institution partner is mandatory for STTR Fast-Track proposals. Explicitly list who the research partner will be and provide a brief description of the work they will perform. A minimum of 40% of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by the small business concern and a minimum of 30% of the research, as measured by the budget, must be performed by a single subawardee research institution, with the balance permitted to be allocated to either of these, or to other subawards or consultants. Subawardees are not permitted to request profit (Line K) as part of their budgets.

The proposing organization's budget justification must discuss the tasks to be performed and how these are related to the overall project. Also discuss any organizational relationships (e.g., common ownership or related parties) between the proposing organization and the subawardee, and the type of subaward contemplated (e.g., fixed price or cost reimbursement).

Subawardees (the institution, not the individual PI or researcher) should also provide a Letter of Commitment that confirms the role of each subaward organization in the project and explicitly states the subaward amount(s). Provide this letter(s) as part of the Other Supplementary Documents.

For NSF SBIR Fast-Track proposals, subaward funds do not count as funds spent by the small business, and the total amount requested for subawards (when added to consultant funds and any other subawards) cannot exceed 1/3 of the total Phase I budget component and cannot exceed 1/2 of the total Phase II budget component.

No significant part of the research or substantive effort under an NSF award may be contracted or otherwise transferred to another organization without prior NSF authorization. The intent to enter into such arrangements should be disclosed in the proposal.

No person who is an equity holder, employee, or officer of the proposing small business may be paid under a subaward unless an exception is recommended by the NSF SBIR/STTR Program Director and approved by the TI Division Director.

Any subrecipients named in the proposal are also required to obtain a SAM UEI and register in Research.gov. Subrecipients named in the proposal, however, do not need to be registered in SAM. Entities can obtain a SAM UEI without full SAM registration. If you have a subrecipient that is not fully registered in SAM, but has been assigned a UEI number, please call the IT Help desk for further assistance.

It is the responsibility of the proposing organization to confirm that submitted subaward budgets have been approved by an Authorized Organizational Representative at the subawardee organization.

An IP (Intellectual Property) Rights Agreement is required for STTR proposals and strongly recommended for SBIR proposals when there is a subaward to another institution. A fully signed agreement is not required for STTR proposals at the initial proposal submission but will be required before a recommendation for an award can be made. Provide this Agreement, as a PDF, as part of the Optional Documents.

Other. This line includes the purchase of routine analytical or other services, or fabricated components from commercial sources. The budget justification must explain the need for the services, provide a description of the services, and give a detailed cost itemization. Any single "other" item with a total cost of $5,000 must be further itemized into smaller costs or supported by pricing documentation (e.g., quote, link to online pricing list, past purchase order) in the budget justification. This detail will be requested as part of the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer's due diligence efforts.

SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Technical and Business Assistance (TABA): Proposers are encouraged to include up to $6,500 in the Phase I component budget and up to $50,000 in the Phase II component budget to assist in technology commercialization efforts (as outlined in the current SBIR/STTR Policy Directive and the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019). Specifically, this funding is for securing the services of one or more third-party service providers that will assist with one or more of the following commercialization activities:

Phase II Commercialization Plan research and preparation
Phase II Broader Impact plan research and preparation
Making better technical decisions on SBIR/STTR Fast-Track projects;
Solving technical problems that arise during SBIR/STTR projects;
Minimizing technical risks associated with SBIR/STTR projects; and
Commercializing the SBIR/STTR product or process, including securing intellectual property protections
If a proposer is not able to identify what commercial assistance may be required at the time of proposal submission, the proposing small business may block up to the maximum allowable amount for TABA activities (as detailed above) on Line G. Other with the understanding that prior to expending funds for these purposes, the recipient will be required to obtain written approval from the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer.

In addition to the above, for the Phase I component of a Fast-Track project only, NSF permits the inclusion of additional funds on the G budget line, as follows. The funds noted below may ONLY be spent on the commercial or business purposes explicitly permitted below. The proposer may budget up to $10,000 as a direct charge on line G.6 of a Phase I component budget for the following specific purposes related to financials and accounting:

Hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare audited, compiled, or reviewed financial statements;
Hiring a CPA to perform an initial financial viability assessment based on standard financial ratios so the recipient organization would have time to improve their financial position prior to the CAP assessment for the transition to the Phase II component of the Fast-Track project;
Hiring a CPA to review the adequacy of the recipient's project cost accounting system; and/or purchasing a project cost accounting system.
If the proposer elects to budget funds for one of the above purposes, the Budget Justification should include a brief description of the desired use of funds. The use of funds must be approved by the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer prior to award.

Line I - Indirect Costs. Indirect costs are defined as costs that are necessary and appropriate for the operation of the business, but which are not specifically allocated to the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project. Common indirect cost expenses include legal and accounting expenses, employee health insurance, fringe benefits, rent, and utilities. If the proposing small business has a Federally negotiated rate, please specify the base and rate and include a copy of the negotiated indirect cost rate agreement. If the proposing business has a history of at least two years of stable operation that reflect the costs expected to occur during the execution of the SBIR/STTR award, please base the indirect rate estimate on this historical data (and provide an explanation if the rate is expected to deviate significantly from the rate used in recent years). Instructions for Indirect Cost Rate (IDC) Proposal Submission Procedures can be found here.

Recipients without experience and knowledge of Federal indirect cost rate negotiation and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 31 Cost Principles may want to consider engaging professional services in preparing an IDC proposal.

If the proposing small business has no negotiated rate with a federal agency, and no previous experience with Federal indirect cost rate negotiation, you may claim (without submitting justification) a total amount of indirect costs (inclusive of fringe benefits) either up to 50% of total budgeted salary and wages on the project or equal to 10% de minimis on MODIFIED total direct costs on the project. Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC): MTDC means all direct salaries and wages, applicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period of performance of the subawards under the award). MTDC excludes equipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships and fellowships, participant support costs and the portion of each subaward in excess of $25,000. Other items may only be excluded when necessary to avoid a serious inequity in the distribution of indirect costs, and with the approval of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.

Note: NSF does not fund Independent Research and Development (IR&D) as part of an indirect cost rate under its awards. See the FAR 31.205-18(a) for more information.

Line K - Fee. The small business fee is intended to be consistent with normal profit margins provided to profit-making firms for R&D work. Up to seven percent (7%) of the total indirect and direct project costs may be requested as a Small Business Fee for the Phase I budget component. Up to ten percent (10%) of the total indirect and direct project costs may be requested as a fee for the Phase II budget component. The fee applies solely to the small business concern receiving the award and not to any other participant in the project. The fee is not a direct or indirect "cost" item and may be used by the small business concern for any purpose, including additional effort under the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track award (and including items on the "Prohibited Expenditures" list below).

Prohibited Expenditures including, but not limited to, Equipment (during the Phase I component), Foreign Travel (during the Phase I and Phase II components), Participant Support Cots, and Publication Costs are not allowable expenditures as either direct or indirect costs. However, these expenses may be purchased from the small business fee funds (Line K).

Budget Revisions. Budget revisions may be requested by the cognizant SBIR/STTR Program Officer. Revised budgets must contain a revised and complete Budget Justification as described above. Revised budgets with budget impact statements that only address revisions are not acceptable for budget processing, see Budget Revision Instructions.

Note: Should the proposal be considered for funding, the NSF SBIR/STTR Program Officer will refer the proposer to the Cost Analysis and Pre-Award Review (CAP) Division’s SBIR/STTR Administrative/Financial Reviews website. Proposing small businesses in this category will be given 10 calendar days to provide CAP the underlying supporting documentation for their budget. The organization should review and understand the CAP documentation requirements as it prepares its budget. Once NSF requests the underlying supporting documentation for the CAP review, proposers will not be given an opportunity to re-budget unsupported costs. Funding will be provided for only the dollar amount that is reasonable and adequately supported. The awarded budget will reflect the supported dollar amount for the proposed effort. Organizations that accept awards at less than the proposed dollar amount may not reduce the effort to be provided; however, organizations may choose to decline award offers.

Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources. Specify the availability and location of significant equipment, instrumentation, computers, and physical facilities necessary to complete the portion of the research that is to be carried out by the proposing firm in the Phase I or Phase II component of a Fast-Track project. Note that purchase of equipment is NOT permitted in the Phase I component of a Fast-Track proposal. If the equipment, instrumentation, computers, and facilities for this research are not the property (owned or leased) of the proposing firm, include a statement signed by the owner or lessor which affirms the availability of these facilities for use in the proposed research, reasonable lease or rental costs for their use, and any other associated costs. Upload images of the scanned statements into this section.

Many research projects require access to computational, data, analysis, and/or visualization resources to complete the work proposed. For projects that require such resources at scales beyond what may be available locally, researchers in all disciplines can apply for allocations for computer or data resources from over two dozen high-performance computational systems via the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) program. See cognizant Program Officer or PAPPG for additional details. If a proposer wants to arrange the use of unique or one-of-a-kind Government facilities, a waiver must be obtained from the Small Business Administration to approve such use.

If no equipment, facilities, or other resources are required for this project, a statement to that effect should be uploaded here.

Senior/Key Personnel Documents. For the Principal Investigator (PI), Co-PI, and for each person listed in the “Senior/Key Personnel” section, the four required documents are listed below.

Biographical Sketch(es). All proposals are required to include Biographical Sketches for each PI, co-PI (if STTR), and Senior/Key Personnel (individuals with critical expertise who will be working on the project and are employed at the proposing company or at a subaward organization). Proposers must prepare biographical sketch files using SciENcv (Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae), which will produce a compliant PDF. Senior/Key Personnel must prepare, save, certify, and submit these documents as part of their proposal via Research.gov.

Full requirements for these documents can be found in the current NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide. Frequently Asked Questions on using SciENcv can be found here.

Current and Pending (Other) Support. This information will provide reviewers with visibility into the potential availability of company personnel during the period of performance if awarded. All PIs, Co-PIs (if STTR), and Senior/Key Personnel must prepare Current and Pending (Other) Support files using SciENcv. Detailed information about the required content is available in the current PAPPG.

For the PI, co-PI (if STTR), and each of the Senior/Key Personnel listed on Line A or B of the budget, please provide the following information, regardless of whether the person will receive salary from the activity:

Name of sponsoring organization.
Total award amount (if already awarded) or expected award amount (if pending) for the entire award period covered (including indirect costs).
Title and performance period of the proposal or award.
Annual person-months (calendar months) devoted to the project by the PI or Senior/Key Personnel.
Please report:

All current and pending support for ongoing projects and proposals (from any source, including in kind support or equity investment), including continuing grant and contract funding.
All current and pending support for ongoing projects and proposals (from any source, including in kind support or equity investment), including continuing grant and contract funding.
Proposals submitted to other agencies. Concurrent submission of a proposal to other organizations will not influence the review of the proposal submitted to NSF.
Upcoming submissions.
The current Phase I proposal is considered "pending" and therefore MUST appear in the Current and Pending Support form for each PI and Senior/Key Personnel.
Collaborators and Other Affiliations (COA) Information (Single Copy Document). This document must be provided for the PI, Co-PI (if STTR) and each Senior/Key Person. This document will not be viewable by reviewers but will be used by NSF to manage the selection of reviewers. Download the required Collaborators and Other Affiliations template and follow the instructions. Detailed information about the required content is available in the current PAPPG. Frequently Asked Questions on COA can be found here.

Synergistic Activities. Each individual identified as a senior/key person must provide a PDF document of up to one-page that includes a list of up to five distinct examples that demonstrates the broader impact of the individual’s professional and scholarly activities that focus on the integration and transfer of knowledge as well as its creation. Examples of synergistic activities may include but are not limited to the training of junior scientists and engineers in innovation and entrepreneurship; the development of new and novel products, tools, and/or services based on deep technologies; broadening participation of groups underrepresented in STEM; service to the scientific and engineering communities outside the individual’s company; and/or participation in the national and/or international commercial market.

Data Management and Sharing Plan. The Data Management and Sharing Plan should include the statement, "All data generated in this NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track project is considered proprietary." This single sentence is sufficient to fulfill the Data Management and Sharing Plan requirement, but proposers may add more detail about how the resulting data will be managed, if they desire. The PDF cannot exceed 2 pages.

Mentoring Plan (Conditionally Required). If a proposal requests funding to support postdoctoral scholars or graduate students at a research institution (through a subaward), a Mentoring Plan MUST be uploaded to the system. The mentoring plan must describe the mentoring that will be provided to all postdoctoral scholars or graduate students supported by the project, regardless of whether they reside at the submitting organization or at any subrecipient organization. Describe only the mentoring activities that will be provided to all postdoctoral scholars or graduate students supported by the project. The PDF cannot exceed 1 page.

Individual Development Plans (IDP) for Postdoctoral Scholars and Graduate Students. For each NSF award that provides substantial support to postdoctoral scholars and graduate students, each individual must have an Individual Development Plan, which is updated annually. The IDP maps the educational goals, career exploration, and professional development of the individual. NSF defines “substantial support” as an individual that has received one person month or more during the annual reporting period under the NSF award. Certification that a postdoctoral scholar(s) and/or graduate student(s) has and IDP must be included in the annual and final reports.

Project Schedule. The required Project Schedule must show the estimated duration and timing of major project tasks that are required to implement the research plan. This document should clearly estimate the initiation and completion of tasks in relation to other tasks within the timeline of the award.

NSF recommends downloading the Project Schedule template and uploading a completed version of this form into Research.gov. This schedule should also provide projected levels of effort for each key person during each reporting period of the project. Key personnel to be listed generally include any senior/key personnel listed on Line A of the main project budget, any persons listed on Line A of any subaward budgets, or any budgeted consultants. The schedule should also include estimates of total level of effort (for all project personnel) and total expenditures for each six-month project period.

Optional. NOTE: Various subsections are REQUIRED depending on the type of proposal (SBIR or STTR), whether the company has a commercialization history, whether this proposal is a resubmission, etc. Please read section requirements carefully.

Letter(s) of Support (REQUIRED). Three (3) Letters of Support from potential product/service users or customers are required; Up to five (5) Letters of Support may be included. All Letters of Support should be uploaded in Research.gov in one PDF.

Letters of Support should address market validation for the proposed innovation, market opportunity, or small business/team, and add significant credibility to the proposed effort. These Letters should ideally demonstrate that the company has developed partnerships and/or a meaningful dialog with relevant stakeholders (e.g., potential customers, strategic partners, or investors) for the proposed innovation and that a real business opportunity may exist. The Letters of Support must contain affiliation and contact information for the signatory stakeholder.

Letters of commitment and supporting documents from consultants and subawards (or any personnel identified in the Budget Justification) are NOT considered letters of support.

IP (Intellectual Property) Rights Agreement (Required for STTR and strongly recommended for SBIR proposals when there is a subaward to another institution). A fully signed Allocation of Intellectual Property Rights is not required at the initial proposal submission but will be required before a recommendation for an award can be made. For proposal submission, place a draft of the Allocation of Intellectual Property Rights or a letter that includes the name of the partner research institution stating that an agreement will be provided upon Program Officer notification of a potential award recommendation.

The SBIR/STTR Policy Directive indicates: “The model (IP) agreement will direct the parties to, at a minimum:

State specifically the degree of responsibility, and ownership of any product, process, or other invention or Innovation resulting from the cooperative research. The degree of responsibility shall include responsibility for expenses and liability, and the degree of ownership shall also include the specific rights to revenues and profits.
State which party may obtain United States or foreign patents or otherwise protect any inventions resulting from the cooperative research.
State which party has the right to any continuation of research, including non-STTR follow-on awards.”
Other Personnel Biographical Information (Strongly Recommended). This section can be used to provide additional biographical information about project participants who are not listed as Senior/Key Personnel for the small business or for a subawardee as well as for writers of Letters of Support. Biographical sketches should be prepared using SciENcv and uploaded as a single PDF.

Other Supplementary Documents. The required other supplementary documents of an NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II proposal are limited to the following (if applicable).

Company Commercialization History (required if the proposer has received any prior SBIR or STTR Phase II awards). This section is required for any proposer who has ever received a Phase II SBIR or STTR award (from any Federal agency). All items MUST be addressed in the format given in the NSF Commercialization History Template. Changes to the NSF template, additional narratives and/or commercialization history documents from other agencies are not permitted.
Letters of Commitment from Subawardees and Consultants (Required, but may be provided in post-award diligence). Please refer to Budget and Budget Justification for details.
List of Suggested Reviewers (Single Copy Document). This section can be used to suggest the names of reviewers who might be appropriate to assess the technical and commercial merits of the proposal. Reviewers who have significant personal or professional relationships with the proposing small business or its personnel should generally not be included.

List of Reviewers Not to Include (Single Copy Document).This section can be used by the proposer to suggest names (or even specific affiliations) of reviewers/panelists not to be involved in the review of their proposal.

Deviation Authorization (Single Copy Document).This section should generally not be used unless NSF staff have specifically instructed the proposer to do so.

Additional Single Copy Documents. This section should be blank.

VI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures
Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.

A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.

Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.

One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.

NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria
The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.

1. Merit Review Principles

These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:

All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.
NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.
Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.
With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.

These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.

2. Merit Review Criteria

All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.

The two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.

When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:

Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:

What is the potential for the proposed activity to
Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management and Sharing Plan and the Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.

Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track programs have additional criteria that reflect the emphasis on commercialization and complement the standard NSF review criteria listed above. The following elements will be considered in the review of the Commercialization Potential.

Is there a significant market opportunity that could be addressed by the proposed product, process, or service?
Does the company possess a significant and durable competitive advantage, based on scientific or technological innovation, that would be difficult for competitors to neutralize or replicate?
Is there a compelling potential business model?
Does the proposing company/team have the essential elements, including expertise, structure, and experience, that would suggest the potential for strong commercial outcomes?
Will NSF support serve as a catalyst to improve substantially the technical and commercial impact of the underlying commercial endeavor?
NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Award Considerations

An NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal includes Phase I and Phase II components. Each component includes an R&D plan and a budget. In addition, the proposal will include a section on the company and team and a section on the Commercialization Plan. Hence, the core of a Fast-Track proposal comprises the following elements:

Phase I R&D Plan
Phase I Budget and Budget Justification
Phase II R&D Plan
Phase II Budget and Budget Justification
The Company and Team
Commercialization Plan
The review of an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal will include a review of both the Phase I and Phase II components of the proposal. A team submitting an NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal must have NSF-funded research lineage; an understanding of the target market, product-market fit and initial target customers; and a complete team.

An NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal must include specific, quantifiable performance targets for the Phase I component of the project. These Phase I targets may be renegotiated with the cognizant Program Officer during post-review diligence, so that at the start of the Fast-Track project, there will be agreed performance targets in place for the Phase I component.

Due Diligence. Once the panel and/or ad hoc review of an individual NSF SBIR or STTR Fast-Track proposal has concluded and the proposal is considered potentially meritorious, a follow-on due diligence process may be conducted in which the Principal Investigator will be asked to provide additional information and/or to answer questions specific to their proposal in order to inform the final decision. This due diligence process will address weaknesses and questions raised during the external merit review as well as by the cognizant SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer. The due diligence process may include requests for clarification of the company structure, key personnel, conflicts of interest, foreign influence, cybersecurity practices, or other issues as determined by NSF. Participation in the diligence process is not a guarantee of an award.

Financial Viability. If the small business' proposal is to be further considered for funding after it is competitively reviewed, the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track Program Officer will refer the proposer to the Cost Analysis and Pre-Award Review (CAP) Administrative/Financial Reviews Site. These reviews are conducted to evaluate a prospective recipient's ability to manage a Federal award responsibly, effectively, and efficiently.

After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of an award or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations, or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with an NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.

The Phase I and Phase II components of a NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal will be reviewed and evaluated separately. NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposals submitted to this solicitation for which the Phase I component is considered meritorious but the Phase II component is not considered meritorious may, based on budgetary considerations and at NSF's discretion, be considered for award as regular NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I projects, in which case (if awarded) the company would subsequently apply for NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II funding via the regular process (i.e., not via the Fast-Track process).

NSF requires each NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track recipient company to attend and participate in the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I Awardees Conference.

Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, and the panel summary (if a panel summary was prepared) will be available to the proposer via research.gov.

NSF SBIR Phase II proposals submitted to this solicitation which are considered meritorious, and which meet all the requirements of the NSF STTR Phase II program may, based on budgetary considerations and at NSF's discretion, be converted for award as an NSF STTR Phase II project. NSF may also, at its discretion, convert NSF STTR Phase II proposals to NSF SBIR Phase II proposals.

Supplemental Funding. America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF is committed to assisting SBIR/STTR Phase II recipients to successfully commercialize their innovation research, grow their company and create jobs by attracting new investments and partnerships. To reinforce these commitments, the programs support a broad number of supplements and other opportunities. For more information, see: Supplemental Funding Overview, and the linked Dear Colleagues Letters.

Debriefing on Unsuccessful Proposals. As outlined in Chapter IV of the PAPPG, a proposer may request additional information from the cognizant Program Officer or Division Director. Proposers may contact the cognizant Program Officer to set up a date/time for a debrief call.

Resubmission. Declined NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposals are NOT eligible for resubmission. A proposer of a previously declined proposal must submit a new Project Pitch and, if invited, submit a new proposal after substantial revision, addressing the reviewers’, panel’s (if appropriate), and Program Officer’s concerns.

B. Review and Selection Process
Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.

Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.

After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new recipients may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.

After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.

Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.

VII. Award Administration Information
A. Notification of the Award
Notification of the award is made to the submitting organization by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)

B. Award Conditions
An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice.

Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Build America, Buy America

As expressed in Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workers (86 FR 7475), it is the policy of the executive branch to use terms and conditions of Federal financial assistance awards to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States.

Consistent with the requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act (Pub. L. 117-58, Division G, Title IX, Subtitle A, November 15, 2021), no funding made available through this funding opportunity may be obligated for infrastructure projects under an award unless all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. For additional information, visit NSF’s Build America, Buy America webpage.

Special Award Conditions:

NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track awards are subject to the availability of funds. NSF has no obligation to make any specific number of Fast-Track awards based on a solicitation and may elect to make several or no awards under any specific technical topic or subtopic.

The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track fixed amount cooperative agreements will not exceed $1,555,000 per award and normally will be made for a 24-month period of performance.

NSF requires each NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track recipient company to attend and participate in the NSF SBIR/STTR Awardees’ Conference.

Terms and Conditions for awards made under this SBIR/STTR Phase II solicitation were posted in May 2024 and are available on the Award Conditions page, under SBIR/STTR Terms and Conditions. The linked page includes "SBIR/STTR Phase II Cooperative Agreement Financial & Administrative Terms and Conditions (SBIR/STTR-II-CA-FATC)" AND "SBIR/STTR Phase II General Terms & Conditions."

The award notice specifies a pre-determined, fixed amount of NSF support for the project described in the referenced proposal. This amount is based upon the budget approved by NSF for the referenced proposal, as amended.

Phase II Transition:

Phase II component funding will be released to the Fast-Track recipient contingent on successfully passing both Stage Gates 1 and 2 of the Phase II Transition Review.

Companies that do not pass either Stage Gate 1 or 2 will be limited to Phase I funding, and the award will conclude at the end of the Phase I component. The final $25,000 will be made available to the company upon submission and NSF approval of the Phase I final project report and upon submission of a Project Outcomes report.

A decision by NSF not to provide additional funding following either the Stage Gate 1 or Stage Gate 2 review will NOT be eligible for reconsideration or termination review as defined in Chapter XII.A.4 of the PAPPG.

Payment Schedule:

Companies that pass both Stage Gates 1 and 2 will receive access to the final $25,000 of Phase I component funding and a funding increment for the Phase II component of the award. Phase II component payments will generally be managed in accordance with the following schedule:

25% Advance Payment.
25% upon acceptance by an NSF SBIR Fast-Track Program Officer of first interim report.
25% upon acceptance by an NSF SBIR Fast-Track Program Officer of second interim report.
The remainder of funds, less $25,000, upon acceptance by an NSF SBIR Fast-Track Program Officer of third interim report.
Final $25,000 upon acceptance by an NSF SBIR Fast-Track Program Officer of a satisfactory final annual project report and upon submission of a Project Outcomes report.
A deviation from the standard payment schedule can be requested if the standard schedule poses significant difficulties for the recipient or would negatively affect the execution of the project. If the standard payment schedule as described above is not appropriate, please request alternative amounts for each payment, and provide a brief justification for the departure from the standard schedule.

Payment of the award amount is subject to compliance with the award terms and conditions and NSF's acceptance of the reports submitted by the recipient. On the basis of its review of these reports and/or other pertinent information, NSF reserves the right to modify the payment schedule or suspend or terminate the award, if NSF determines that such actions are appropriate. If estimated total expenditures are significantly less than the award amount, the recipient shall contact NSF to renegotiate the scope of this award. Similarly, if the recipient expects that the full scope of work will be completed at a total cost significantly lower than the award amount, it is the obligation of the recipient to promptly notify NSF.

C. Reporting Requirements
For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final annual project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.

Failure to provide the required annual or final annual project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.

PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final annual project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.

More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.
