        Catechism (Comprehensive Project Description):
        
• What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
• How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
• What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
• Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
• What are the risks?
• How much will it cost?
• How long will it take?
• What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?

        # Future of Life Institute (FLI): A Comprehensive Overview

## Mission and Vision

The Future of Life Institute's mission is to steer transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks. FLI believes that the development and use of powerful technology will be the most critical factor in determining the future prospects of life.

### Core Mission Statement

> Steering transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks.

## Historical Context

Human civilization has been shaped by technology throughout history. However, we are now in an unprecedented era where:

- Humanity has the power to affect or destroy all life on Earth
- Life will be engineered by intelligence rather than evolution
- The rapidly increasing power of technologies like biotechnology and AI brings profound and perilous changes

## Key Initiatives and Strategies

1. **Policy Development and Advocacy**: Bridging the gap between technology experts and public institutions
2. **Outreach and Education**: Informing policymakers, technologists, and the public about challenges and opportunities
3. **Research and Research Support**: Supporting research on problems stemming from transformative technologies
4. **Grantmaking**: Funding research in fields insufficiently resourced by existing sources
5. **Institution-building**: Designing and launching new organizations to improve governance of transformative technologies
6. **Convening and Coordinating**: Organizing events and activities to promote global coordinated action

## Focus Areas

1. Advanced Artificial Intelligence
2. Militarized AI
3. Nuclear War
4. Pro-social Platforms
5. Climate Change (secondary focus)
6. Bio-risk and Biodiversity Preservation (secondary focus)

## Core Principles

1. **Impact-driven**: Prioritizing projects with large positive impact
2. **Cognizant of urgency**: Balancing action with analysis
3. **Forward-thinking and anticipatory**: Planning for foreseeable problems and opportunities
4. **Driven by science and reason**: Acting on humanity's understanding of the world
5. **Inclusive**: Honoring experiences, rights, and autonomy of people and sentient beings

## Primary Cause Areas

### 1. Artificial Intelligence

From recommender algorithms to chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is changing our lives. As the impact of this technology grows, so will the risks.

### 2. Biotechnology

The dangers from biotechnology, including accidental release of engineered pathogens or backfiring gene-editing experiments, are too great to proceed without caution.

### 3. Nuclear Weapons

Almost eighty years after their introduction, the risks posed by nuclear weapons remain high, with new research revealing even worse impacts than previously thought.

## Organizational Structure

- Founded in 2014
- Co-founders: Max Tegmark, Anthony Aguirre, Jaan Tallinn, Meia Chita-Tegmark
- Full-time staff of 20+ team members worldwide
- Board of directors, including prominent figures like Elon Musk
- External advisors from various disciplines

## Major Achievements and Initiatives

1. Hosted the first AI safety conferences
2. Launched the world's first peer-reviewed grants program for AI safety research (2015)
3. Formulated the Asilomar AI Principles (2017)
4. Produced viral short films on autonomous weapons ("Slaughterbots")
5. Named civil society co-champion for AI by the UN Secretary General
6. Established the Future of Life Award
7. Launched the AI Convergence Project
8. Worked on strengthening AI regulation in Europe (European AI Act)
9. Created the "Imagine A World" Podcast

## Public Engagement

- Official website: [futureoflife.org](https://futureoflife.org)
- YouTube channel with educational videos
- Active presence on social media platforms
- Monthly newsletter reaching over 41,000 subscribers
