        # John Templeton Foundation: A Comprehensive Overview

## History and Mission

Founded in 1987 by Sir John Templeton, a renowned investor and philanthropist, the John Templeton Foundation has become a pivotal force in funding interdisciplinary research and fostering conversations that inspire awe and wonder. Sir John, who began his career on Wall Street in 1937, was known for his contrarian thinking and investment acumen. His passion for understanding value eventually broadened to encompass fields like theology and philanthropy.

The Foundation's mission reflects Sir John's belief in the importance of open-minded research and progress in spiritual understanding. Their motto, "How little we know, how eager to learn," encapsulates this approach and drives their commitment to exploring life's biggest questions.

## Funding Areas and Scope

1. Science and the big questions
2. Character virtue development
3. Individual freedom and free markets
4. Genetics
5. Voluntary family planning
6. Gifted education
7. Life sciences
8. Human sciences

The Foundation is particularly interested in projects that explore the intersection of science, philosophy, and theology. They support research that addresses "big questions" about natural and social sciences, philosophy, freedom, and world religions.

## Grant Application and Selection Process

The Foundation welcomes funding requests from anyone, including charitable entities operating both inside and outside the United States.
