Inês Hipólito ~ Active Inference Insights 004 ~ Markov Blankets, Modularity, Enactivism

welcome everybody to the fourth episode of active inference insights I'm your host Daris Pary Wayne and today I have
the pleasure of Hosting inz hippolito inz is a lecture of philosophy of artificial intelligence and mqu
University in Australia our research focuses on 4E cognition which holds that cognition is embodied embedded enacted
and extended beyond the brain and she studies how this framework can help us understand and build other systems that
exhibit a form of augmented Mission including brain computer interfaces neurot Technologies and smart
environments in addition to this she co-founded the international Society of the philosophy of the Sciences of the
mind with gutier picini and she is currently the ethics uh ethics advisor
um in artificial intelligence versus the cognitive Computing company which
implements active inference into artificial intelligence agents um inz
thank you so much for joining me it's an absolute pleasure thank you so much for having me uh the pleasure is mine and
it's um we were just discussing off a that you know we're doing this across
many oceans so Nez is in Australia I'm in London um but we managed to sync it up which is which is fantastic exent so
I wanted to start with markof blankets um all things start with Mar
Markov blankets um Mark of blankets really play a fundamental role in active
and in the framework that we apply to artificial intelligence to cognition more generally and also just the
underlying physics and math of back to inference and a lot of your work has focused on Mark of blankets and the
scaling up of Mark of blankets so maybe a good place to start for our audience would be if you could just give a simple
overview of exactly what a mark of blanket is and then we can go from that yeah fantastic uh yeah you're absolutely
right when you say that everything starts with the mark of blanket everything that is a thing um is has got
a mark of blanket and that does not necessarily mean um that a mark of
blanket is going to correspond to a certain kind of like physical boundary that one can see uh right a mark of
blanket um is a theoretical formal construct that what it does is it tells
you um how or what things are going to be influencing a certain state to be the
case right so it's it is a statistical Tool uh precisely to understand
something really important uh which is how a certain thing is coupled with
within or with its environment um so everything does start everything has its
markco blanket does start with the markco blanket because it is a way in which we can
capture two very important aspects um and these two aspects um are that um a
thing um typically an open system as the thing um is um both thermodynamically
open and operationally closed so this is quite crucial um because it is what
allows the thing um to persist not to perish not to succumb to the second law
of Thermodynamics so Mark of blanket is really become uh very useful because to
my understanding um they allow us to capture simultaneously these two
features being both operationally open oh sorry operationally closed and
thermodynamically open because what happens is the system is situated in the environment in a way that it is open to
the environment it must be coupled with the environment otherwise it is uh perishing um it will not maintain itself
but it also has a certain boundary that allows it to maintain its coherent for
so the markco blankets become really interesting because they allow us to capture those two dimensions of um an
open system and what is an open system an open system is mostly everything that we see uh we don't really come across uh
closed systems excellent yeah that's great um I'm wondering whether you could give us
a sort of overview of exactly how that coupling works so people may have seen that the mark of blanket is essentially
composed of active States and sensory States um that makes sense if yet if
we're talking kind of about physical boundaries like actuators arms legs and so on but on the understanding The Mark
of blanket is a statistical entity what does um what what what
really are active States and sensory States um in the theoretical way well
there are many ways to answer this question um it will depend on how much you want to connect um then the active
inference framework and formalism uh with other uh theories that we find in
physics or in Neuroscience uh so there are many different ways in which one can
answer um this question um but for the sake of remaining um with the kind of
like more scale-free application of markco blankets and not reducing to
immediately uh to the brain um I will uh keep the formalism as something that we
can apply to understand the statistical relations or
influences um between a system an open system and its environment um right so
then what you have is you have the possibility of understanding how a
certain system is in a particular state so you understand that and then and then
what you can also understand is you can make predictions about future States in which you may find the system by virtue
of using this kind of for formulas right uh so then what you have is you employ
or Define that the level or aspects um of scientific interest are going to be
your internal States right and then your next question is going to be okay how do
I find this system in this PR in this precise uh time and space in these
particular States what are the the the the states uh in which the system is
situated that are going to be crucial for me to find the system in this
particular State and therefore I understand um the system and potentially ideally I can make some uh nice
predictions about future States so this will be our internal States so then what
we need to we need to get on is then we need to get to Define what are the external States and those are like I
said the states that are going to be influential uh for immediately influential for um the system to be in a
specific kind of like internal States now this is all done the next step is to
understand that internal and external States they mutually influence one
another that's what it means about something being an open system right is that there is exchange of mattera and
energy such that the system is remaining in a certain State and for example is
not um going into into a face space um uh such as like perishing or or towards
um towards uh death um so then um what what you get is an understanding of um
what I was just saying which is how the system is coupled and in this permanent
um continuous exchange of matter and energy in order to remain
alive and push back on the second LA themodynamics right so you get this
operationally closed and open system at the same time that is uh very well captured by these internal and external
States and I did say that uh they influence one another but it is important um to
understand that they do not directly influence one another they need a second set of States um so basically internal
and external states are conditionally in opin it and they will require the intervention of a second um set of
states which is very much what you asked uh the active and sensory States right
so these are going to be the ones that are doing the direct communication if
you will between each other where um hopefully and ideally we have um a
balanced influence between sensory and active States right and these um direct
influences between um sensory and active states are going to play a crucial role
in order for us to mathematically trap down and understand the coupling of the
system in the environment which is the system being internal States the environment being external States so
this is just like the overview of uh the mark of blanket and the active inference
formalism that we could apply to anything that is an open system wonderful yeah that's great
that's a really useful explication of the framework um I think it's as I kind
of hinted to in my initial question it's it's rather easy to think of it as a physical boundary so we can think of
cell boundaries or the blood Bane barrier or the boundaries of my body and
then when we do that the notion of sense reactive States really becomes intuitive
in the sense that in the case of my body all it is is an action perception Loop and that's being known to be critical to
intelligence or cognition for a very long time so that said there's also a very strong
position which is that it's actually just a statistical description of the way things act the way things persist
through time that leads me to ask the question of should we consider the markco blanket to be in uh interpreted
in an instrumentalist way in the sense that it's kind of a way it's a tool that we can use in modeling objects open
systems or is it or should we be inter in it in a realistic way I.E there is
actually something uh that is ontologically a mark of blanket that is
truly out there as a markco blanket um embedded within lots of other markco
blankets of course yes I'm really glad that you ask that uh question it's a Live question um and um there are many
ways to answer um this question so the way that I that I that I that I decided
to answer the previous question was was in a way that one understands that um a
mark of blanket is a tool is a statistical tool it's a formalism it's a
mathematical construct right and I also did not go immediately
into the brain uh or an organism with actions and Sensations because I'm
trying to avoid uh precisely um the literature that tends to reduce the
framework to thinking that active States and sensory states are going to be
action and sensation right that is not the case right um so a mark of blanket formalism
from active inference can be applyed to anything that is an open system and there are many um examples of this in
the literature such as for example I can think of um the example of when you have
a set of um of pendulums in a room or a set of clocks in the same room what's
going to happen is uh that eventually they will synchronize right and you can use this framework to capture to predict
that synchronization right so it is important to understand that this is a mathematical construct that you can
employ to precisely understand patterns of behavior in the natural world right
so we've done that um we understood that so then we can think about it you can
use this uh framework to develop for example simulation models which allow you to understand the phenomenon of
scientific interest as well as hopefully it's a good model is going to give you some prediction power over future states
of the thing which doesn't have to be uh anything to do with cognition can be something um uh that is situated in the
natural world right then a certain phenomenon happens specifically in
cognitive science when we notice that specifically in cognitive science even
if you apply a certain computational framework doesn't have to be active
inference a certain computational framework is applied to model simulate
for ex and get some predictive power about for example black holes let's say
black holes right uh and they use that kind of like mathematical framework and then you employ the same
kind of mathematical framework the same kind of like ationalism to understand the brain because after all both a black
hole and uh a brain are complex systems what does that mean it means that it is
extremely difficult for us to model it why is it extremely difficult to model it because it is very high in dimension
so it's really hard for us we don't have the computational power to to model it which is why we need to incorporate
something called uh dimensionality reduction because we don't have the tractability to to Pro precisely do that
now keeping up with what what I was saying in cognitive science specifically a phenomenon happens so
imagine this we use the same computational um strategy to model
things from the natural world all the way to the brain right and then what
happens is that we would never say that the brain had sorry that the the the
black hole or something that is not uh part of uh a living system would have uh
specifically a mark of blanket or would engage in literally active inference we
would understand very clearly that this is computational strategy that we are developing and employing for epistemic
purposes to understand the phenomenon and to get some predictive power that's
what we're doing and we are happy with it if we get some predictive power that's success in science and then one once we do this
move and apply exactly the same formalisms into for example the brain or an organism right we tend to
anthropomorphize it right so we tend to say okay so then the brain is acting
precisely literally by engaging in active inference or in other uh Realms
engaging in predictive coding right so we lose track of understanding that okay
these were the tools that we started off with and we were very happy when we were modeling black holes with these tools we
were happy that we had some predictive power but now it's not enough we won't more well now we want to go from The
epistemic Virtue into an ontological predictor now we want to say that the
thing that we are modeling trying to understand developing um uh models for
epistemic gain is precisely has the properties or the ontological properties
that the model the computational model has right and that's when you get into
making a realist or taking a realist stance on and upon active influence
right you don't have to you can do it but then you're going to have to defend
that position in a way that okay you're going to have to answer so if you are if
you are applying the question that you need to answer then is if you're applying exactly the same framework to
model and predict black holes that you want to do the same with
brains do you get to say that brains engage literally in active inference in
ways that black holes don't and why so that's the realism take and the problems
that you find and what where you would uh be led to or you remain in the more
cautious kind of position which is on the instrumentalist or non-realist position in which case the position is
that all things in the world with with with the real existence right and those things
behave in ways that we would develop models to understand that behavior in
terms of patterns patterns of behavior the things exist in themselves
they interact with the world in themselves the patterns of behavior are
our scientific constructs so then we talk and then we can start talking about okay so I can
pattern behavior through for example employing developing a model on the
basis of Maco blankets active inference and then I pattern the behavior what did
I did what I did was I found patterns and therefore an explanation for a
Behavior Uh and this explanation is something that I didn't have before right right right right well I'm going
to take us towards some realist position now because I think people will find it interesting about the
the ontological claims ontological implications uh that act of inference has especially within the cognitive
science and the Neuroscience community and I guess when you're taking a real stance on the Markov blanket that there
are these structures which have some kind of um embedded nature in the brain right and and people have probably heard
frisen talk about how this is actually reflected in the phen phenotypic nature of the brain and its
hierarchies um it makes me think about modularity so mod it for people who
don't know was introduced by Jerry Fodor um in 1983 and the basic idea is that modules
are these kind of um innate neural structures which have kind of very specific functions and fdor in 83 laid
out sort of certain category certain functions that they a modular system
would have to um you know would have to obey by so domain specificity the fact
that modules have to operate on a very specific type of input um there's also
informational encapsulation this idea that like at least how he portrayed it in 1983 that these modules are
encapsulated with respect to high orderer beliefs that that notion got sort of you
know weakened over time let's say and then there were further about the actual neural architecture would have to be
involved in mod uh modules but anyway people can get the basic idea um of a module we might have a visual
module a hearing module a module for language right which would yeah which is
idea clearly taken up um or that tronsky found a lot of joy in um all that to say
what does active influence have to say about this picture of the Mind as being modular to any interesting degree and
does this notion of kind of at least for predictive coding position position a
hierarchy in which you have feedback loops in which the top down affects the bot the top layers affect the bottom
layers and vice versa does that actually really have anything to say about modularity and more generally the
architecture of the brain yes um well I'm really glad that you you're taking us there we do have um a couple of
papers that do um engage a little bit with uh the modularity of the Mind one
of them is Mark of blankets in the brain and that paper and the the one is parcels and particles um and um in there
we do briefly mention um reasons why thinking uh or patterning
the the brain Behavior the brain activity in terms of markco blankets would be useful for many reasons uh for
for for for applications that go all the way to DCM uh dynamical caal modeling in in Neuro Imaging but I'm going to set
that to the side and I'm going to specifically speak to uh the modularity of the mind you very well said um the
modularity of the mind is is one of the is one of those um theories that we've
been having in philosophy of mind that has been very foundational for cognitive science and for the ways in which we ask
questions for the ways in which we look for things in the brain um and has been
uh as influential as it has been refuted uh so very few people today I can think
of three people people uh that would endorse good old school fodorian modularity of the mind and there are re
there are philosophical reasons for that and there are scientific reasons for that philosophically uh there's been
made very substantial solid strong arguments against it and uh
scientifically um evidence shows neuroplasticity shows neural reuse in
ways that would contradict uh the modularity of the mind I will make here
just a recting of a little bit of history of philosophy of mind just um
before I get into U the active inference um understanding of um cognitive SLB
brain um activity and Dynamics just to say that it's interesting to see that we have this tendency so I'll do a little
bit of philosophy of Mind here we have been having this tendency in philosophy of mind or at least analytic philosophy
of mind um which is to look at and this is a point that has been made by many um
influential philosophers uh for example Francis Egan um she has made this very uh clever point and I
think she's absolutely right when uh we look into World philosophers of Mind look into what is happening in computer
science and then we adopt the best computer science at the time to
establish a kind of like a metaphor to how the mind supposedly work at the time
as you said in 83 uh Jerry F looked at um uh touring machines and in he and he
asked the question what would happen if one would conceive the mind as if it
were a touring machine and then he writes the book right what happened is
that what starts off as being like sort of like metaphorical thinking right it
eventually starts becoming a very ontological uh claim that the mind is
ontologically modular and that is very um it's very important for us to look
back in history so that we know what to do and what not to do in the future right because what happens is then you
set off cognitive science to look for those modules in the brain as you set up experiments as you set up uh uh uh
simulations computational simulations you set off to look for and find those very um then you have all of those sets
of properties that are supposed to be the model so there's the automaticity there's the domain specificity there's
there's the information encapsulation there's the top down information oh sorry uh the B
information going all the way up to cognition cognition mean so all of that framework that was a theoretical
framework adopted from computer science then is defining the whole cognitive
science field and what we should look for right so it's quite interesting and important for us to know our history to
know how things really happen in a way that well you look back and and you see how how it then science came back and
said well it kind of actually doesn't make sense that the mind is modular in that way uh so not only philosophically
we have refuted it and very u in ways that we have forced the modularity of
the mind to reinvent itself to revise itself to survive really and what
happened was um because the problems were coming to arise from philosophy and from from from Neuroscience what
happened was we started having to revise the modularity of the mind because the noveles were coming up but we did not
want to let go of the modularity of the mind so we start revising the basic pillars and then we start having to let
go of basic pillars and that's when you have massive modularity by petas for example and still um challenges continue
to come up right so then you start going into this other uh this other field
which was known at the time um cognitive penetrability so now what you allow is
you you you you revise modularity to the point that it's not just bottom up information going up but now you will
allow for bottom up and top down that's cognitive penetrability right and then it comes up um around
2010 and stays until 2020 still is a little bit here because as we um sort of
like um explored a little bit in a in a in a special issue that we we we just had out um this year with Michael kof
it's a special issue in Consciousness and cognition and it's about uh the bean brain and how whether how or whether uh
the visian brain predictive coding is compatible to the modularity of the mind
and specifically to uh the one that allows the this traffic going up and
down um such as uh cognitive penetrability and there are still um a
few people that um very are very engaged um in defending that kind of um of
modularity of the mind that is um quite um agreeable and comp comptible with
predictive coding and examples of that are for example more conservative um uh
approaches within U predictive processing theories of the mind for example the predictive mind prediction
error minimization uh mostly developed uh and headed by um by yakob Hui um that
would be one that um you can find as as as having some agreement with with
modularity of the mind of course the revised version of it which is uh the one in which uh it
is it allows traffic to go up and down and that's of course you can see the parallel as it being predictions coming
down prediction errors coming up and the traffic being very contentful in nature
therefore you have a version that it has got this compatibility between modularity of the mind and um and um and
the the predictive uh brain what happens is and I'll just wrap this up and go um
then to active inference what happened there if you think about it is you let
go of two things that were very precious for Jerry fer you let go of horizontal
boundaries and vertical boundaries and once you let go of that you really have to ask the question what is left of the
modularity of the Mind why should we keep it in place at all whatsoever right because what happened was you let go of
one there was the basic pillar of of the modularity of the mind which was the
boundary that was a distinguishing or dividing uh cognition on top and modules
at the bottom right this boundary doesn't you don't have this boundary anymore because now you have predictions coming down so you let go of this
boundary so Jerry doesn't get that and they have the vertical boundaries as well which
were very precious because those were about information encapsulation such that different modules are the main
specific and they do not talk to each other right so what you is you get rid of those vertical boundaries there's
there's an interesting there's an interesting historical point there um that just sorry to interrupt but this is
an interesting there there's an interesting chronology here which I actually learned during my undergrad where when I was looking at whether the
language comprehension was fundamentally modular so it was related that's hence why I brought up n jsky in 83 fodal has
very distinct definitions of information encapsulation and Dom specificity so do specificity is actually what we just
spoke about that there's a proprietary database that each module works on right so visual the visual module work on uh
photons or whatever you know or the language module works on syntactic
nodes and information informational encapsulation in 83 was top down beliefs
expectations doesn't affect the workings of those modules interestingly in in
2000s so he he writes another book or or article about modularity in the year
2000 he kind of conflicts and again I don't want to speak ill of Jerry fodo he's very important and he's also not
here anymore so he can't defend himself but he seems to confuse information encapsulation with dom specificity
because he talks about like this is a quote that a system is encaps a module is encapsulated if it's restrict if it
function is restricted to what its proprietary database contains so I think what's interesting there is factly what
you're were talking about in terms of horizontality and verticality kind of abandons the verticality there right he
wants to uh yeah he he abandons the verticality in the sense that by by sort
of a mission he concedes that maybe we should let go of this idea that top- down beliefs expectations don't
influence lower levels he does keep the um the horizont horizontality which is
let's keep these as distinct systems working on discrete um languages or data
for ones of a better ter so so it's just an interesting historical fact there that I think if he was H frodel might um
he could obviously offer some clarification but may also go back on his original 83 position of top down um
the the restriction for top down information to flow into modules yes absolutely and um I think that this is
also how you are absolutely right um in in in specifically the point about the
conflation between information and caps olation and the main specificity these are two different things and one of the things that are
that one of the aspects that I think would would need to be abandoned and that we abandoned in our Mark of
blankets in the brain is precisely that notion of information right so because you can
have domain specificity without relying on this notion of information encapsulation and things not conversing
with each other because again to my perspective that is anthropomorphizing the brain and brain activ ity right
we're talking about Dynamics and activities of the biology kind in the
brain and there is an anthropomorphization uh that I don't think it's necessary and again it proved
itself unnecessary right um so um but but we learn so much from from learning the
history of where these ideas come from and they have a place of course U and I think it's important for us to precisely
learn where they come from such that we start um improving and advancing our
understanding of uh the brain and cognition in different ways so there is
definitely place for for for Jerry Fodor um and I think that this is the place is
to get us into other other other uh advancements in the field and what um
what we have been able to to to to to see and uh through scientific evidence
in in in neuroscience precisely that that kind of way of thinking that may
have started as a metaphor doesn't really hold right and that there may be
um domain specificity I think you put it in a very nice way there may be domain
specificity without it being information encapsulation right and once you start
having to let go of all of these basic pillars of modularity it's gone we can
try to salvage it and then call it something and brand it something else but it's gone and that's when then you
also see in the history well we have now new um computational uh capacity or
strategy such as parallel distributed processing what shall we do let's try to apply the same thing that we did which
is what if we would think about the mind as if it were a parallel distributed processing system and then you have the
networks and predictive processing theor start rising up on the base of that analogy as well I am careful about going
over and abond and above the anal the it being a metaphor right because I always
think about the brain as a very biological kind of system as opposed to
a full agent with full capacities that thinks and reasons and models as if it were a scientist so I push back on that
I'm careful about that so the way from that position on then the way in which we theorize Mark of blank blanket is
being useful was you start from those understandings that the brain is a dynamical complex
system right that it changes over time that the ways in which
a full agent engages with the environment is going to have
significant impacts on the ways in which pathways are strengthened or are
weakened in the ways in which the brain is going to develop itself as an organ right
so you start from that very neurobiology kind of understanding of the brain that it is a complex system
meaning that it is a coupled system it is situated in a body it is situated within other organs uh in in in the
organism and this organism is situated in the environment right so we we we completely abandon the view of the brain
as being a predictive machine there even though you can and there's lit chore on
building upon the idea of the brain which of the brain being a predictive machine which comes from from Helm holds
and more recently you can theorize it and I've been um I've been presenting on that as you you can theorize it as the
low road or the high road to active inference which we can talk about later but the view is you can take that
pathway that's not the one that we took uh we took the pathway of the very neurobiology uh kind of way of the brain
being a highly situated organ within a larger system the larger system being
situated in an environment and all of these influences and interactions are
going to have an effect on the state that you're going to find the brain in a specific uh uh um point in time and
space so so then um starting from that understanding as opposed to the brain
being a a machine uh right so then we ask the question of whether or not uh
because this is what this is crucial this is the crucial point which is why I started by by describing mark of blink
is is this scientific construct that you can apply skill free comes skill free uh
that you can apply to anything that is a thing there is an open system you can apply it you can also apply it to the
brains but then you once you do that you have to test it out right you have to look into okay does this really make
sense can we find patterns of activity that would be explainable
through the application of Mark of blankets at different levels of
organization within the brain itself so then in that particular paper what we did was we we are we start from a
standpoint where we reject the modularity of the mind because we do not think that there are reasons scientific
reasons to think that the the the the the brain is
organized in very strict rigid ways call it modules whatever we want to call it
but in very strict rigid ways we do not think that that's the case because there is scientific reason not to take that
path and the Brain being a very Dynamic and changing um system then the question
that you have is how do we make sense of it right how do we find patterns in such
a dynamical system in such a coupled system how do we find those patterns can
we find those patterns so then let's apply this um uh Mark of blanket formulas
at different levels given the data that we have coming from DCM coming from
dynamical causal modeling of the brain so basically um in very very simple terms The View here is that we put the
brains in Scanners we get data out of the scanner and then we look at that and
just vast data the comic sense of it Con and start to think about how to make sense of that you employ DCM as a model
to make sense of that data and what you would get get from that is a nice causal topology about how um uh uh how
connections are made and Dynamics are formed so you get a nice pattern of that
if the model is is is is suitable and useful then you that's what you get so then from that kind of like um
scientific um point we we we grab all of that all of those nice models uh from
DCM and we see we look at whether or not we could apply the mark of blanket
formalism so the four the two sets of States um internal and external active
and sensory States in order to uh get an explanation of those pattern Dynamics at
different scales so we start off with the the scale of a single neuron and
then we have a cical column and then we have regions right and what is the what
is the the the take on message from this because of course if if anybody's interested uh in the details then the
paper is out there um but what is the take on message there is that we do find
the same patterns of behavior across scales by virtue of employing this uh
formalism and that is that is really good that's already quite um quite quite quite important because that means that
you can get what we started off our conversation with you can get um
understandings of activity that is occurring in the brain at different
scales where uh each of those scales is both operationally closed and
thermodynamically open so then what you get is you let completely go of that
rigid systems that you had with the modularity of the mind you completely let go of that and what you get is an
understanding of how um certain neurons in in in specific um environments you
can think about it in a very simple way as like a cell in a Cell tissue how a cell in a Cell tissue is interacting and
engaging with the tissue in order to do what it needs to do um so you can think
about you can use this formalism to precisely understand how that particular
system is behaving according to the environment that it is at so then you find these patterns of behaviors of like
certain neurons firing given certain um conditions and then you get all this
nice understanding of discou Behavior being situated that is highly Dynamic
and it really is dependent on the environment that it is situated at what
you also realize is that there are certain parts of the brain there are
certain specific parts of the brain um that you can see that they may be
insulated that they they they do not um conform to um active inference they do
not exchange um and that's in a way if you wanted to say that would be what Jerry F
had in mind as a modularity of the mind you could say that but all that happens there is a very simple bi biology
process which is the system already knows what to do without needing to know
what is going on in the environment it is what we say as it is set by Evolution
it works so it's been working so well that way that it doesn't need to know or get to know feedback from its
environment right so those would be the ones in which you would say oh it's encapsulated but it's informationally
encapsulated I wouldn't say so right right right right yeah there's a lot of that there's a lot of that um
cool I mean it I you also gave a really nice um description of for cognitive
science there so exactly as I said in my introduction um the four e for those who
can't remember embodied extended see if I remember enacted extended you get all
of them yeah um and I'm enjoying the history lesson as well so um because I
do as as you said I think the chronology is really important here just to get a picture of the philosophical foundations on which this work is being done but
eight years after Jerry Fodor releases the modularity of the Mind the very important book comes out which is the
embodied mind of Raa Thompson and rash before we go there because you work I
guess within that framework of as you said for cognitive science the embodied mind I think listeners will be curious
about you you mentioned scientific evidence refuting uh
modularity I just wondering if you could provide this maybe just with one example of a module which is not exhibiting the
typical um the typical features that Fodor laid out which would make it fundamentally modular so what what makes
it open let's say to its environment yeah one very clear example comes from the all the research in neural reuse so
that would itself already um sort of like move us away or it's it's I would
say it's it's strong reasons to move away from that rigidity of modules that
are do not change that are um as Jerry fod would conceive of it they are
hardwired in that way so another feature that you lose is the automaticity right
so the idea with the auto automaticity is that modules in a way are silly right
they don't know really what's going on they are hardwired to automatically process the information that they domain
specific to right so that's the automat automaticity they don't really have a
say in the meta so to speak um even though I'm completely anop anthropomorph
ing this story as as one would with the modularity of the mind uh so you you do
lose that um with with with the the the large evidence on on on um on neural
reuse where you see um which is extremely compelling and it it's
absolutely fascinating that you see certain neurons that we used to be
neurons for vision to become neurons for something else like like odit Tre system
for example depending on the necessity of the whole overall
system so what you see is the neural reuse um uh cases where well it really
it really challenges the basic aspects or properties that would make a module a
module right don't make domain specific or is it domain specific if it becomes the main specific to something else uh
the automaticity um as well so the the the the neural reuse um I think would be
a it's it's a great challenge um another one is of course neuroplasticity so the
studies in neuroplasticity do um challenge again the rigidity of uh the
the the the the non changeability of this hardwired um system yeah absolutely
okay great that's really useful yeah yeah I always think about um I think I got to about the murk effect when I was
learning about modularity of mind which is this auditory visual illusion that when people yeah people can search
up or do the murk effect but again that that brings into question um this encapsulated idea that muls can't speak
to each other okay excellent well as I said what became very popular uh after
these kinds of rigid computational accounts of the Mind was an activist
embodied models following verel Thompson and rush and verel was of course a
biologist and so um and he introduced the term aesis which kind of means this self
organization that we now speak of or self- evidencing um before 1991 so so as
you were saying we are inclined now to look at the brain as a biotic thing as a
biological system and this is very much uh for grounded in um embodied cognition
maybe it would be useful for everyone if we could just go through the four e
firstly um it doesn't it doesn't have to be super it's a very rich history um so I'm you know as long as short as is
suitable but maybe we could go yeah one by one and think about where is the
evidence or where is he philosophy or as the intuition that this is true um and
we can start I guess with the the first one which is embodiment what what does embodiment mean and kind of what is the
research around the embodied brain what what does it focus on what does does it Center on all right very very good um so
um embodiment is um something that is is a concept that comes from phenomenology
um from the existentialist Philosophy from phenomenology it's a very rich uh
concept and it is fundamental to understand a lot of confusion in the
field because we need just we need to distinguish between weak and strong embodiment I will call strong embodiment
the one that comes from chology and existentialist philosophy such as the one that for example Sim B had in mind
the body that one has that grounds our experience of the world that's the kind of embodiment from SIM
or um and um then within the E Frameworks uh within the E framework you
have different theories and while they do agree with let's say a couple of um
principles they are going to disagree age with within certain more nuanced
aspects of their own theories and I think the embodiment is one that is mostly useful for us to understand the
State of Affairs in the field and the theory and the confusions right so um
let's say that it is very reasonable to to think that most people in the field
of cognitive science today are not going to reject that the body plays a role to
understand the brain that the body plays a role to understand cognition very few people would disagree with this right
the followup question is how do you understand the body and I will get to that I will just say that only those
that would conceive of cognition as encapsulated in the brain as a computer
system such as the prediction error minimization accounts or for example
yakob who is kind of conservative account um that there he says very
clearly you can throw away the body the world and other people because the brain sufficiently as a machine takes care of
the cognitive business so that would be the only account that I know of that would not bring in the body to play a
fundamental role all other accounts do agree I think we have come to that
agreement that the body plays a fundamental role embodiment plays a fundamental role now the question the
follow-up question is how do conceive of embodiment and then you have two ways the weak and the strong weak embodiment
is the one that is endorsed for example by um predictive processing theories such as Andy Clark as the Visionary uh
behind it what happens there is that Andy Clark in his account invites the
body to play a causal role in cognition and this is important because also with the with the with the with the with the
body you can um interact with a world that is Technologic iCal where there are
things that then give you the extended mind but I'll I'll get to that if if we
have the time anyway so it's weak embodiment what does this mean this means that um cognition is a predictive
processing that takes place in the brain so this agrees with more conservative
predictive uh aor minimization accounts but not only in the brain predictions
but the prediction processing machine includes the body what does this mean
this means that the body is seen as part of the predictive machine the body is
seen as computational cognition is computational so that's why this is weak
embodiment so anic clar does not endorse the embodiment that MTI or Sim had in
mind he endorses a very computationalist kind of embodiment so this is why you
can kind of like to understand the E cognitive science you kind of have to spread it out within a range and then
you get like um you get like the more conservative ones and the more radical ones right the more conservative ones
are the ones that are going to say that cognition is computational the more
radical ones are going to say that cognition is not computation and then you have a spread out of of um of the
question that you can ask to help navigate the ecognition uh literature is
how radical do you want to be because if you want to say that cognition is computational you're not
radical at all right and radical doesn't have anything to do with original
radical just means how radical you are in comparison to Old theories such as
the the the computational theory of mind what is the computational theory of mind is everything we' been talking about with the modularity of the mind and
predictive processing theories this is all computational theory of Mind how radical are you in relation to the computational theory of Mind where are
the basic assumptions are to that cognition comes down to um uh
computational processes of information processing that's computational theory of mind and that the mark of the mental
is mental representation there would be more Nuance thing things to say but this would be two that you can ask yourself
and then you can ask how radical am I away from these two assumptions right so
that's the view and then you get like this weak embodiment which is very close to or if not it is um kind of like right
in the border between computational theory of mind and ecognition almost like shouldn't be there if you would
conceive that uh cognition within e the E umbrella is not computational right uh
so that's the very weak embodiment and then you have the strong embodiment which is any theory that explains
cognition by grounding cognition very much uh within the embodiment that the
experience that one has of the world of course here what we talking about is uh
the level of analysis and and understanding that uh people working in that field are looking at is um about
the full um agent that is situated in an
environment we are not talking about neurons of course we take that into consideration in the sense of the causal
relations that I mentioned before which is how is it that the experience of the world is going to aect effect and
influence the Bly biological processes and in there you also find the brain so
that's kind of like the strong embodiment from mopon H and all of that kind of thing uh that we have and mostly
applies to uh psych Psychotherapy and and and and psychological analysis and
then you get into um uh let's say in activism right and then in an activism
you find um different kinds again but let's say that both strong embodiment
and in activism they reject these two things they reject that cognition is a
computational process of information processing uh and they reject that the mark of the mental is mental
representation so they reject these two things right they reject in kind of like different ways but non not
non-compatible but they they they want to reject these two assumptions um so
the an activist um has different different ways um in which uh you can
also formulate of it um so you have the verela Thompson and rush so verela and
Matana uh starting the autopoetic um uh in
activism uh which is a very rich uh literature very based in in biology and
extremely compelling uh and very well formed um and then of course um others
more recently pick up on um autopoetic and activism and uh they have developed
more recently um the framework towards uh sense making uh in activism now I
want to just stop here to go to autois just to make the bridge with active inference where you can right where or
at least where I find that it's reasonable to make that breach um autoptic and activism um brings out and
a lot of recent work by an activists they also stress uh that out um they
bring out the understanding of crucial aspects of living systems from bacteria
to us um as having those two aspects as being thermodynamically open and as
being operationally closed and those two aspects Lounge the system into a state of precariousness so these are main
Concepts within theop poetic and activism and what this can then mean
that we can think of is that what does it mean for a system to be precarious well what it means is that the system
must must must interact with the environment in order to remain alive
what does this mean well this means that the system is coupled with the environment now again what does this
mean this means that the system the living being cannot be encapsulated from the environment what this would refute
is the conservative computationalist views that cognition comes down to being encapsulated in the brain and we can
throw away the body the world and other people so that's kind of like what this means so that's why the question is how
radical are you from The View that cognition comes down to computations in the brain right how radical are you so
we're making our way towards a more radical one and then once you find these ideas of like operationally closed
thermodynamically open therefore a state of precariousness therefore must be coupled otherwise it dies then you say
well this active inference framework actually captures that very nicely because I get conditional independency
from internal and external stat that would allow me to get the operationally closure but I also get the direct
influence of being thermodynamically open that comes from active and sensory States so then it really nicely captures
that state of precariousness as a tool so that's that's nice I think and then
you can um you can go as radical as you want which is to completely push back on
um any views or kinds of theories or ways of thinking that would bring out uh
cognition and cognitive systems from bacteria to more sophisticated inculturated systems like us um as um
being computational of any kind and this is something that I've been presenting as augmented cognition in the in the
sense of um the kinds of like computational models that we develop um and
mathematical thinkings that we develop they are our cultural PR practices right
so in that sense we developed these very sophisticated ways of making sense of
the natural world of which brains are part of living systems are part of right
we develop all of those very highly sophisticated systems and computational
um capacity um to make sense of the world around us and what I'm very very
careful is not to make that last step which would bring me back to the computational theory of mind to say that
those computational strategies are ontological predictors of what the brain
is of or or of what the living system is so I am very careful about that that
maybe put me in the very radical position because I reject all of the computational theory of mind uh view um
so that's how you kind of like make your way within the ecognition is by asking how radical are you in respect to to
computational the of mine excellent great um I think we have
two more e but we but we basically touched upon them um one is
embedded um and the next one is extended um do I give a brief absolutely word to
that absolutely so um the embedded one is the one that as I was spre spreading it out in range and I was saying that
well um you have here very close uh you have a bound with the computational
theory of mind and here you have the radical stuff so embedded is here close to the the the computational theory of
mind and this is the E that I mentioned before when I explained that um very few
people in com in cognitive science in the field would reject that the brain is
embedded in the body and the body is embedded in the environment very few people would reject that so that's the
embedded that's why this can be seen as almost close to the weak em embodiment
that's the embeddedness very few people would talk about encapsulation only with that exception
of the one that is the prediction rization by Yakov can throw away the world um and other PE the body and other
people so that's the embededness is just the claim that the body is the brain is
situated in the body the body is situated in the environment now then how you are going to explain that situatedness is where you are going to
fall in different ease in the strong embod in the different kinds of uh in activism
the radical in activism or the more sense making in activism um how you are going to explain that it's the
embeddedness is what's going to make the difference on our radical you go and then you have the extended which I
briefly mentioned um so the extended comes as a part of like a package uh
with um uh radical predictive processing by and Clark so the package is that um
it it is it is radical in uh relation and in comparison with prediction and
minimization um or conservative one it's radical in relation to that but it's not radical in relation to other eats so
what happens is that what you have is an understanding of cognition as being a computational process that takes place
where well not only in the brain but also in the body right the body plays a causal role for that information
processing predictive processing to occure and to happen uh in the ways that it does now it can also incorporate
objects tools from the environment that are going to play a causal role of the
same kind as um your body plays so then you have a whole system that is
distributed it's is a computational system we still talking about computational theory of mind it is a computational system that involves brain
body and tools and that's the extended mind great um and yeah I always feel the
need to kind of refer people to where these ideas come from so um extend of my hypothesis Clark and Chara's classic
paper um and definitely worth checking out I think when I hear uh these
stronger an activist or stronger for recognition um perspectives which refute
representation as the mark of the mental or Mark of cognition it makes me think
uh where does Consciousness fit into all of this because as a conscious
um you know subject uh being with a subjective start upon the world I you
know I I have some sympathy for the enti list view because I think it feeds into some intuitions that I can't like this
mind is privileged and can be divorced in some sense from the world upon which it does some computational work so if
really we we we take the privilege away from representation um
which which I think is also a kind of worm so we don't have to get into exactly what is a
representation but maybe we maybe we can go there um what's what's the kind of R
of qualia subjectivity intentionality and the kind of uh features of
Consciousness oh thank you for that question I always feel like when um when
we go that path um the mental representation being the mark of the mental um it feels like uh we are
getting to watch a TV show halfway through like in season two right because we don't ask the questions where the
representations and content comes from right so that's the hard problem of content so I know that we want to get
that because that would allow us because we already are in the place where we do
have me we can engage and develop and more and more every more sophisticated mental representations that what we are
that's what part of what we are doing here is engaging in ways in which we are involving and employing uh mental
representation such that we can understand each other right so it's like we're already half season halfway
through this through the TV show we are already like in season three um so but there was a beginning of the TV show
right well you didn't have any of this you as a baby as an infant could not be communicated with me in this way about
these things where does that come from that comes from something called inculturation right so I think before
before we start explaining things as if they were always like that we need to understand that there is a trajectory in
cognition in cognitive development that we shall not forget so all of those things had to be acquired unless you
want to defend nativism that that would be also could could be very close to Jerry F as well
because you already have these starter packs that you already have this very very much in place um Machinery that
would allow us you to have all of these sensory all of this semantic content already ready to use that you could
start making sense now if you reject folder you reject it all now you have to
answer the question how can we do this where does this come from you've rejected folder right so you have a
story to tell now the way that I I see it and many um in activists do see it uh
and by the way also very much compatible than with mathematical uh Frameworks of
dynamical and complex Theory um and that is that is employed in in in a lot of
psychology uh uh Empirical research as opposed to the computational theory of mind uh even though that's the
mainstreaming in cognitive psychology it's not the only one um and the way in
which you can think about it is that you um cognition the m so what I'll start by
saying this I've I've heard many times people ask me but how is it possible
that there's cognition but there is no no mental representations no one is saying that so that's not a claim that's
not a claim from an activist an activist an activists don't say that there aren mental representations what they tell
what they want to tell you is that mental representations do not come for free you are not born with them you had
to do things in the environment in order to acquire them you have to to develop
it as a skill so we give you a story about a hard problem of content where does that come from when it does not
come as within the nice starter pack that cherry foder or decart would tell
you that it comes from so once you get rid of that you have a story to tell and the story is that it depends on
inculturation so basically as you start as an infant as a baby we we come into
the world and we start interacting with the world this world is and this is the key point this world is already social
it's already a social cultural setting there is no baby that is born and is developing within a setting that is not
social already so it is in the ways in which the baby interacts with the their
caregivers that the parents are the caregivers and the world around them
that is going to gradually allow them to build um simpler um Concepts simple ways
of using Concepts and then scuff holding that into a a numerical system in a
conceptual framework and then later on in being able to engage in logical
thinking and reasoning and then being able to express some sophisticated ideas
and maybe even becoming a scientist and contribute to developing highly sophisticated computational models that
study black holes so it's an inculturated process of course as we are
here doing this interaction um what we are using is we are making the best use
of our most skilled to so far uh and I'm sure that um that will go keep going in
a in a in a a trajectory but our best skills of um explaining ideas and
discussing so we are using and making the best use of our best mental representations but I also have to say
that this interaction does not reduce to those U mental representations there is
an embodiment aspect of the situation that we are at a a very clear uh example
of that is that the interaction is different whether or not we are having the interaction in person or we are having the interaction online we'll make
things different because we don't share the same physical space so this is just an example of um how embodiment here
would play uh uh uh some some would play out but the idea is that eventually
you'll start developing the capacity to develop and engage in mental representations also as you talk to
other people and you make sense of the world around you okay cool um I'm going to play not
going to play Devil's Advocate but um and I also don't want to make you commit to any position nor am I asking you to
solve the hard problem of Consciousness because that's not that's not going to happen this also not the purpose of the
podcast but I understand in that sense that mental representations are kind of
Downstream on enacted behavior on social cultural norms right it they as you say
there's a lot of evidence to suggest that it's not some hardwired Chomsky and module right there we can take that as
kind of axiomatic I guess my question here is that kind of makes sense in terms of mental representations per se let's say
they develop out of this inactivist um way of being that we have what it
doesn't necessarily answer is the kind of characteristic features and the idiosyncratic features of
Consciousness so the actual like fundamental what it is like to be me
what it is like to be you to use Thomas Nagel's terms so I guess my question here is
um again not trying to pin you down I understand there's a lot of nuance here would the an activist be uh sort of
would they be attracted to the notion that Consciousness is epip phenomenal and by that I mean for people who don't
know epip phenomenal Consciousness is the idea that Consciousness is like the steam coming off a steam train so it's
caused by uh neural physiological Behavior but doesn't actually have any causal effect on those um on those
mechanisms so it happens it's there right and it kind of depends on what philosophy of Mind Theory you um
subscribe to but would they say that Consciousness has no causal role um I'm
imagining that there aren't many substance dualist in activists but what
what what kind of considerations have they made of the role of Consciousness right um so I I I'll just bring some
some something in so that so when we talk about qualia uh
epiphenomenalism um um and uh what it is like um like in the bat um what is like
to be a bad Thomas nle when we are or or the the hard problem of Consciousness when we talk about that we are within a
certain conceptual toolkit right we are already within what
wienstein would call a bottle a theory right and it's important to to to
understand that when we start making our way within a
theoretical path it's like we're building blocks of a house and then we getting a certain kind of house by
virtue of the the belief system thoughts that and the path that we are
doing that's the kind of like conceptual Machinery that you get once you play
that game so and by playing that game I'm here referring to or having in mind
viin Stein's language games so you can tell the story of or you can do the epistemology of
understanding uh how cognition comes around and about and works by playing
different games and that is the traditional analytic philosophy of Mind
Game and that game is very associated with the computational theory of mind so
what I'm trying to say here is that once you put on certain goggles there are certain things that you're going to see
and there are certain things that you cannot see so once you start on that path of
thinking Journey those are the problems that you're going to find those are the problems that like the hard problem of Consciousness is a problem that you're
going to find because then what you get is uh how do we study both the easy
problem and the hard problem so you necessarily when you start going in that direction you find those problems and
then you have the explanatory Gap that how we close the gap so these are problems that come up within the
computational theory thinking language game so those are the goggles right and of course we can try to make
these theories talk to each other but it's very important to understand that it's almost like axiomatic in the sense
that you start solving an equation in one way it the equation will look a
certain way you start solving the equation in a different way the equation will look in a in a different way right
so that's almost what we are talking about right because we are not starting
from the point in E cognition doesn't start from the point of view of the
brain in the other um more traditional computational theor of M of course it does so once you do start from the bra
brain being machine note what questions come up okay so if the brain is a machine then how is it that it gives
rise so it's a scaling up problem how is it that it gives a rise to Consciousness
how does this machine give rise to Consciousness because there are there is evidence that there's Consciousness that
is what it is like to be about there's qualia there's a hard problem of Consciousness this is within that kind
of thinking because you start by the brain being a machine and then you ask how do we get to the good stuff and then
you get all of that from within the more radical e cognitive science you don't
start from the brain being a machine that's the first thing you reject right and that's also in dynamical and complex
systems theory the case you have phenomenal work by Van Helder and other people that precisely reject that
cognition has anything to do of being anywhere or we should use any conceptual
uh any concept from a computational scientist perspective to Kit right so
then you don't start from there you start from the point of view that living systems are precarious and they engage
with the world to maintain themselves the brain is part of the story but you
don't start there right so in this engagement what happens is you have you
engage with the world because you have certain goals usually the goals have to do in a more minimalistic biology way is
that you don't want to die it's the precariousness of of pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics right so
you engage in the world for that reason because you want to remain alive typically this is the most basic biology
there's much more than that but let's just stay with that so then what happens is you start exploring the world and in
exploring the world you do that by exploring your body so that's when the body comes in as the body is the means
by which you have access and explore the world and respond to the world's and
invitations to exploration so it is in these interactions with the world that are extremely embodied and limited
they're both constrained and possible by the body that whatever you do it's
cognitive behavior and this cognitive behavior is what are the goods that we
want to understand in cognitive science and we do that by by explaining them
through patterns of behavior right so it's completely different
goggles yeah I I am going to push back because I think it's I think it's good it's not adversarial it's collaborative
um I I just sense or I just kind of believe that the Vicken styan relativism
has its has its limits right it has its points where you say well there are certain things that maybe aren't
relative in the language game and maybe one of those are the fundamental aspects
of my experience that I can attest to regardless of if I'm in a braid of
lat or if I'm an evil demon is tricking me right like unless I adopt some illusionism about Consciousness which
I'm not willing to do but again like it's not there there's not a viable position to do but I'm going to take it for granted that like even even radical
illusionists wouldn't say that qualia doesn't exist it's just not what we think it is and I'm think here Kei Frankish and den it so for me like the
Vick steinan relativism that qualia is itself part of a um Paradigm to use a
sort of term of Thomas [ __ ] or it's part of a boss or it's part theoric yes in the sense of the linguistic aspect of it
but the fundamental phenomenon is at least for what I can tell is real so
what is the alternative I guess is my question right yet I I I don't I'm not refuting the notion that a cognition is
in some way constrained and opened up impossibility by having a body by being embedded in the social context and so on
but we still have to GR in my opinion we still have to grasp with the fundamental
facts of phenomenal experience so I'm sorry if I sound like David Charmers and
David Charmers parrot but no it seems to me that like I can't get away from the
explanatory Gap and I don't think that that's a problem in my theoretical framing of the problem I think
that's because the phenomena phenomena associated with Consciousness is so radically different from anything else
in the physical Universe yeah and and there are very um I must say that there
are very good points that are made by David chalas in that respect that I that I uh very much um agree with
um now to go back to that and to link that in a way that would be um that
would be compatible within uh my view of an activism I would say that and also
wienstein um there is a real world that you don't
have access to so I completely agree with what you said right I completely agree uh that
there is a limit to relativism yes that's the limit the limit is the limits of my view I'm not going to say the
limits of my language as which I did in the first in the first book in trus because you overcame that so I'm just
going to um I'm going to dare to reformulate that for him and say the limits of my perspective are my world so
there's there there there are aspects of the world that I will not have access
to and that's just the way things are I will not have access to your experience of the world because and here's the
inactivist bit coming in because my experience
is determined by the set of past interactions that
I've had with the world and this moment right here where um this experience is
taking place and everything else outside of this I don't have access
to that's the bit in the Bo in in the box right so the the the idea is not the rejection
of other perspectives and that's precisely vien Stein's point is understanding understanding that there are it's the humility of understanding
that there are other perspectives in the world and you do not have access to them you only have access to your own uh very
um specific kind of perspective to the world now another thing that he adds that it may be uh useful um is to say
that for him these are seen in terms of aspects of the
world you see the world through the aspects that are made relevant to you
right here right now given what given your past experiences your past interactions of the world that's why
certain things will become Salient in this particular moment in the environment which connecting to the
other Theory you would call the what it is like to be me to what it is like see
I don't know if I would um the well to me I wouldn't right I
mean the the salience of my environment I completely agree is shaped by my body
it's shaped by my homeostatic requirements it's shaped by my sociocultural upbringing status and so
on but the fact of the matter is is that things we could describe things as being
Salient without necessarily invoking well that's a good question I guess whether we could invoke salience
of out Consciousness but I guess I I mean as a force experiment you can in a sense um I had John Vu on last
week and he was talking about relevance realization and so it's very sort of still fresh in my mind I said my my
reading of this would be that salience is just a manifestation of the conscious experience itself but are we going to
get any closer to the actual fundamental characteristics right like whether it's salience or visual perception or
auditory perception I mean like the Charmers problem is still there
right uh the Chara's problem is okay let's let me just go back to the initial thing because otherwise I'll lose it um
that you said um um the the note that the difference between the Frameworks is
quite it's quite this simple thing which is Things become relevant and Salient
and experienced in a certain way within ecognition because of the embodied
experiences that you've had in the past within a computational theory of mind you might say the same you might say
things are relevant what it is like to be me why well because of the way that
information has been process processed in the brain as a as a as a machine so these are different explanations for the
same kind of phenomenon they're diff they are completely different so this is where they are aart
right um now as to the problem of um the heart I think when you said Chara
problem you meant the heart problem of Consciousness right um y okay so it may
be the case and this is also a Vian sign move so I'm not going to take credit for that um uh it may be the case and this
is very in line with with David chers which is why I think there are certain features of it of of of chmer thinking
that I that I really like and agree with um vians makes this point not everything
that is there to be understood about the mind can be understood through the
scientific meod and this is the hard problem of consciousness that chmer talks about
right and and I think that he makes a good point there I think that he is very
um cever and very very correct and I completely agree with three points that
he makes which is that many people are falling up on the Trap of claiming to
study Consciousness and experience and a first person however you want to call it
depending on the theory you're coming from um embodiment if you like they claim to study embodiment and conscious
experience and all of those kind of like good things that really make us by going to the brain Alone by
studying easy stuff and that is a theoretical trap it's a fallacy and
that's where I really agree with with David charma's work which is why I'm doing what I'm doing in in ecognition
precisely because I do not want to get into that trap which I think it's it's a trap as well I agree with him great
wonderful well that's our that's our convergence point and again I it's it's it's not so much that we need to solve
the hard problem but I'm just curious about whether it retains its problematic nature in in for so that that that's
good to get some clarity on that I Rend I wonder just it it's it's a difficult
question but and again I'm not trying to get you to solve the whole problem I'm just curious about your thoughts on this
I said I had John Vu on last week and he's got this idea that getting more
precise on the f function of Consciousness would help us in resolving the nature of Consciousness
the hard problem do you see any viability in that
link you can get some something by the function if you within the Frameworks
that I work on active inference and activism right Within These Frameworks I'm going to give the answer within these Frameworks you can get some
explanatory traction you can get some um epistemic virtue out of thinking function but it doesn't get you all the
way through it gets you to understand the precariousness and why systems
behave in the way that they do it's because they the function is that they want to push back on the second law of
Thermodynamics they want to remain alive but then you think about a point that Simon DEA made which is also a very
clever point which is if all that is to life is to not to
perish then what is it that makes us different to vegetation right so function gives you
as much as it's interesting and relevant to the point that it explains or it
gives you as far as a cross life explanation so one thing that you get is
the function is all life does not want to die typically That's the Law that's
the that's the free energy principle that's all but it gets you as far as that and
you want more because you want to get to the goods of like uh embodied experience right why
people behaving the way that they do right so here I think
that you can bring in also again some on the above wise is is is I think is a
good segue into um making this point which is very under the E umbrella but I think she makes this point in in a way
that here is it's going to make the point um clearer which is that if if
again going back to the point if all that is to life is not to perish then what makes us different from vegetation
what makes us different from vation is that we are in um a kind of cognitive
development trajectory that we become enculturated we are situated in Social
cultural environments and once that happens we start behaving in ways that not only do
we get the conceptual toolkits the reasoning Etc but we also have access
and contribute and Co construct those social environments from the very
embodied situation that we are at so in a way the biological body constraints
the access and co-construction that you do with the world as well as the social culturally developed embodiment also
plays a role in the participation that you have or not have within the
environment that you navigate now she puts this in terms of uh the living being between it's it's
a condition between freedom and facticity which see how how compatible
this is with what we were saying about push pushing back on the on the second law of Thermodynamics you want to remain
alive but you don't want to remain alive within an encapsulated environment you want to remain alive and do really well
in a social cultural environment which is why we are more than simple vegetation that just wants to leave we
want to live well we want to live good we want to do things that are good for us so we start now entering the realm of
reasons like reasons that we need to give for the things that we do in the ways that we act right so now we start
to become very sophisticated start to get to this like uh mental representation if you will but it
doesn't come for free it's not a commodity we we now we start getting into like season 3 right which is like
things start to get like really interesting so then you can explain um embodied experience as being social
culturally situated that is dependent on the embodiment that you have and that
embodiment that you have is what is going to somehow determine where you are
navigating continuously between freedoms and facticity and she puts it even more
precisely between um agency and
objectification and then you start reasons to how you navigate the social cultural World wonderful yeah yeah it's
the first time I've had s b brought up in intive inference conversation but um
she that that's great uh yeah it's a wonderful segue actually into existentialism and phenomenology and and
we're big fans of mlo Ponte and haiger and draus on this on this podcast as well I thought what you said was
interesting which is that as you as you said correctly the free energy principle is a principle it's like hamiltonian
principle of least action right it's kind of a where it's it's a first principles ontological explanation of
just like what in the case of the FY principle what things have to do if they're going to continue through time
to persist but active inference um or in
certain cases predicted processing or in certain cases computational theories of mind or in certain cases it activat
theories mind are what we call Process theories so it's if we take the free agent principle just to be axiomatically
true in the sense that it's kind of and I think Carl would say this himself it
if you actually put it down to its nuts and bolt it doesn't say too much right it's things do what things have to do to
continue to be the things that they are really and there's a lot of fun maths but it's really about how it's
implemented in us or artificial intelligence or whatever it is um those process theories become
falsifiable so predicted processing might not be the right account of uh continuous St space um active inference
or um perhaps the mind is uh you know fundamentally Downstream on the body in
in a radically embodied way I guess because it's falsifiable um a question that came to
my mind when you were speaking um about activism is and the history as well of cognitive science is as you say there's
very few people who will adopt a radical computational um position these days
daycard John C for example but for cognitive science is very popular right
to put it simply can you envisage a future where for where future science and future
philosophy tell us that viewing the mind as embodied enacted embedded what was
the last one go on Wikipedia um yeah is not the
the right way to view it as we now look back on the computational picture and think it's incomplete yeah okay so I I'm going to
go back to the goggles um it it seems that the ways in so so science is built
on um on First Steps right on the goggles that you put and then you end up
with certain kinds of um theories that now you have and now what would I do
with this I test it I see if it makes sense right in with the case that it doesn't make sense uh we we we don't
know but it is about putting these goggles um and a lot of what is done still in in
cognitive psychology is very daycard is very starting in in season 3 in like
okay minds are mental representation so nobody cares about things that or about
experiments or setting up experiments or thinking or reasoning about how did it come to
be right where we we should put more effort on that how it came to be which
is what by the way dynamical in complex systems theory applied to psychology does that's all they do all they do is
to uh focus on the developmental trajectories to understand how they
evolve and develop how States change into um developing and evolving um and
and much of what is done in cognitive psychology is starting in season 3 is
the the mind is representational and now we got to find that not only in our
cognitive psychology experiments as we put as we as we design our experiments
right is with that assumption in place and that's why this is so dangerous it
may be the case that one is right to think that the mark of the mental is mental
representation but not criticizing it and not having a critical point of view about it what what it means is that
everything that we do within cognitive science science within setting up experiments within setting up
computational models simulations it's going to be starting with the assumption that the mark of the mental is mental
representation and that the brain is an information processing machine so this
is going to be defining for everything that we do and all that I'm saying is that let's take a step back and go to
the beginning of the series as opposed to starting in in in season three and question these things and if they still
make sense great we've done a very good job right so so that's that's the point
of view right and I think that what ecognition the more radical view does is
it takes away that those toys and puts you into okay when you have to start
from the very beginning what do you have and how do you build so it it it puts
things into into pressure on whether that is the case because when you do the bit of the
history of philosophy of mind and you realize that a lot of it has been done
by borrowing conceptual toolkits from computational science then you ask the question what is left for philosophy of
mind is there a philosophy of mind or is there a borrowing conceptual toolkit from computer
science now that is a that's a provocative question I'm not going to I'm not going to try and answer it it it
it's cool the way you talk about the the scientific theories it reminds me we had ma alberon as our second guest and
actually on the day of us calling this the podcast just came out so everyone should definitely go and watch it but we had a long chat about epistemic
communities and the kind of silos that people end up in and that's actually very much akin to what you were saying
that people can really end up stuck in their scientific Paradigm and I'm really hoping that doesn't happen to
me I think it's kind of happening already I mean it makes me think the my
my sort of um philosophy science is not as good as it should be and it should get better but I'm aware of Thomas C in
this idea of the Paradigm the way it sounds to me is that like I don't know I'm adopting a kind of more heelan
perspective where um you got the computational theory of the mind and in activism like radical in activism as
your thesis um and your sort of antithesis and you have this dialectical
relationship right and then what you might end up with is a symphysis and that might I don't know
it's a very broad question but do you see science unfolding in that
or is it kind of more of a incremental Pursuit towards a higher or or getting
closer to truth so um yeah you do have those two different paradigms and I would answer that in in in in in a in a
very clear way I think that all that we have in the computational theory of mind
is our human social culturally situated
experience as a human species best efforts to understand
a phenomenon in the natural world so we develop all this computational Machinery
strategies models Etc because we this is what makes us human we want to
understand the world around us and part of the world around us is human beings
right so then we we have all of that as a reflection or as telling or as a
manifestation of what we can do as a species when we come down to being
epistemic communities and these epistemic communities are and ma was
absolutely right are completely social culturally situated so uh science itself like our
own individual experience of the world does not occure in an encapsulated
manner we could aim for an ideal bird ey
view perspective of being doing science in a way that is completely objective but as
wienstein already told us we don't have that we cannot get out of the trajectory
that brought us here we cannot have access to that other perspective only our own and that is going to be biased
and overlooking that it's dangerous because one would claim that that that
is possible and that's not that's why our best our best um capacity as a human
species is these epistemic communities where we can exchange ideas test ideas
with each other give feedback to each other and improve each other's thinkings and um an experiment such that we
improve in a collective effort that is scientific wonderful I like that it's
spiriting I don't like the idea that we're just stepping on the the toes of our ancestors maybe they did have
something good to tell us and we can build together but maybe never get there because we're blinded in some sense I
mean um obviously where one cannot speak therefore one must be silent um in this
case we could go on forever um I do want to make it clear that your work is
incredibly Broad and diverse and touches on a wonderful range of things so we could have spoken about religion you
have a wonderful paper on religion from an act of inference perspective um autism among other things uh we didn't
even touch upon artificial intelligence agents um so there's going to have to be
around two I suppose it there's where can people find
your work what are you working on what have you got coming out where can people find you because I'm sure they'll want to know more about what you're doing
yeah just on my website that's usually what is updated um which is www. energy
poo.com so usually there you got the links to other places like Publications
Etc and on Twitter as well I'm usually active so anything that comes out uh any
uh conference that I'm organizing participating or papers that are out I always share them on on on my Twitter so
that's usually the places super great okay that's wonderful well it's half
past 11 UK p.m. so I need to need to dash off to bed but this has been an
absolute pleasure um it thank you so much for your time and yeah as I said we should definitely do this again oh thank
you so much what a terrific uh exciting uh uh conversation thank you so much and definitely up for round two well

Summary Of Program Requirements
General Information
Program Title:

NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds (NQVL)
Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD): II. Design & Implementation

Synopsis of Program:

The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act1 aims to ensure the continuing leadership of the United States (U.S.) in quantum information science and technology. In conformance with the NQI goals, an argument2, 3, 4, 5 was set forth for a renewed emphasis on identifying and fostering early adoption of quantum technologies to transform the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) and to accelerate broader impacts on society. A systematic approach to maturing quantum technology platforms by integrating end-users and potential customers from other fields of science and engineering and other sectors of the economy into cycles of research, development, and demonstration should lower the barriers for end-users to pioneer new applications. NSF support for use-inspired and translational research in QISE, combined with continued strong support of the underlying foundational research, is anticipated to accelerate development of a market for quantum technologies.

With this program solicitation, the Foundation is taking the next step in implementing the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept as an overarching shared infrastructure designed to facilitate the translation from basic science and engineering to the resultant technology, while at the same time emphasizing and advancing its scientific and technical value. The NQVL aims to develop and utilize use-inspired and application-oriented quantum technologies. In the process, NQVL researchers will explore quantum frontiers6, foster the development of QISE education and workforce development strategies, engage in outreach activities at all levels, and promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE, thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. Engagement with all sectors of the United States (U.S.) QISE community will be necessary for this initiative to succeed, and, indeed, the project is designed to include participation from a full spectrum of organizations who have expertise to contribute. In particular, NSF recognizes that the involvement of industry partners is essential and will welcome these to be a part of the overall structure. Partnerships with other U.S. Federal agencies under the NQI umbrella are also encouraged.

While this solicitation lays out the vision for the entire NQVL program that includes Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects, support for enabling technologies through Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS), as well as a central coordination hub, only proposals for Design- and Implementation-phase QSTDs are solicited at this time.

Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. The QSTD:Design project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Pilot phase.

Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. The QSTD:Implementation project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Design phase.

It is required that prospective PIs contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposal is appropriate for this solicitation.

I. Introduction
The translation from basic knowledge to new, scalable technologies that can provide solutions to real-world problems is a multi-step process that requires prototyping, validation, at-scale testing, and eventual full-scale demonstration. As an approach to achieving this goal for quantum-related technologies, NSF has instituted the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept. The overarching goal of the NQVL is the demonstration of practical quantum advantage, the actual application of the tools of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) to problems that will enable solutions that classical approaches can only solve much less efficiently or not at all.

The NQVL vision is to support a highly accessible shared research infrastructure framework that draws on the full spectrum of expertise throughout the Nation to rapidly translate QISE ideas formulated in the laboratory through prototyping, validation, at-scale testing, and eventual full-scale deployment. A co-design approach will facilitate the quick transfer of discoveries from one phase to the next, enable the rapid identification of gaps, and draw on the talent necessary to close these gaps. A key focus of the program will be to develop education and workforce development strategies that promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE by expanding access to state-of-the-art resources and prototypes to all parts of the U.S. research ecosystem. While the completed NQVL will consist of a set of primary nodes defined by the major Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration projects defined below, the overall structure is designed to serve as a resource for the community at large, facilitating the flow of talent and ideas through a central coordination body.

The successful translation of QISE research under the NQVL will require the integration of several layers, from fundamental principles to prototypes to applications, utilizing a convergent, systems engineering, and co-design approach. The co-design of enabling technologies (e.g., reliable materials fabrication, scalable device manufacturing, dependable quantum interconnects, or robust software stack) and sufficiently mature physical platforms will result in Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD) for scientific discovery that will be made available for use by the broad scientific community. Users will identify applications that can be co-designed with a rapid cycle of system upgrades, resulting in the transition of ideas that are still in the early conceptual stages into prototypes that are in level of readiness that they can be handed off to the private sector.

The NQVL is envisioned as having three components, though only the Design and Implementation phases of the first component below are the focus of this solicitation:

NQVL:QSTD – Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration projects. These projects will make up the scientific and engineering core of the activities that combine to form a federated NQVL infrastructure and are expected to pass through three phases: Pilot, Design, and Implementation. Given the project nature of the NQVL:QSTD activity it is expected that the participants will proceed through all three project development phases as listed in the eligibility requirements.
Each NQVL:QSTD project is expected to define a quantum advantage goal and a projected pathway for achieving that goal. It is expected that this pathway will have a focus on the design and integration of quantum systems co-designed with applications developed by the full spectrum of diverse talent of the user community. Through this process of systems design and prototyping, the project will connect the underlying basic scientific knowledge to an application that is identified by this end-user community and fostered by direct interactions between these users, the systems engineers, and the basic science developers. Those activities will be complemented by appropriately scaled education and workforce development plans for training diverse talent in the quantum workforce.

NQVL:TAQS – NSF aims to provide resources to support research and development of enabling technologies identified by the NQVL:QSTD projects as they mature through the various phases. NSF envisions doing this through the mechanism of the Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS) program as an independent funding opportunity that will address critical needs of the NQVL infrastructure as well as contribute to expanding the access to the Laboratory to a wider community.
NQVL:Central – NQVL Planning and Coordination. NSF anticipates support for one NQVL Central Hub that will perform three distinct functions: i) promote collaboration and networking between the NQVL project teams; ii) promote engagement with the broad QISE community, partnerships with others and outreach activities to the general public; and iii) facilitate community oversight and the development of success metrics and benchmarks. The first function will enable the identification and potential exchange of component parts among the teams, especially in the Implementation phase. The other two functions recognize the need for greater accountability to the wider QISE community and to the public.
As such, NQVL:Central will be called upon to serve as the intellectual hub for the growing QISE academic community. The NQVL Central Hub will also facilitate connections between the units of the NQVL and the activities of other agencies as well as establish mechanisms for industrial participation in the QSTD goals. The NQVL Central Hub will connect with the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) and professional societies whose membership includes existing and potential practitioners in QISE. The NQVL Central Hub will host workshops and scientific programs that foster connections and dissemination throughout the QISE community. Lastly, the NQVL Central Hub will be asked to develop and maintain a Strategic Plan for NQVL investments, a living community document designed to keep abreast with evolving trends in the field, progress toward community goals, management and coordination, and implementation of new directions.

The development of the NQVL is expected to take place over several years. The present solicitation concerns only the Design and Implementation phases of the QSTD project components of the NQVL. Separate solicitations will be issued for the other components of NQVL, depending on the progress in the QSTD phases. At every QSTD project development phase, it is critical to keep in mind the full project development as described below while formulating plans, especially as many of the general requirements will apply to each phase. Support for the QSTD-enabling technology development part of the NQVL program will be on an as-needed basis as the subject of future NSF funding opportunities.

The NQVL program is intended as a national, community-driven effort that supports the smooth integration and translation from fundamental science and engineering to use-inspired applications. Building on the continued and sustained support of fundamental research from existing NSF programs, the NQVL will draw together expertise and talent from a broad range of disciplines to enable the creation and application of functional quantum devices and systems. Coordination will be provided through a federated infrastructure that serves much like a laboratory, but without the physical co-location of all assets and infrastructure, to identify roles and resource needs and establish mechanisms to enable all members of this virtual laboratory to communicate and function together as one coordinated unit. The federated NQVL structure, which will be developed and led by the community, should enable anyone to become engaged and contribute to advances in QISE.

II. Program Description
Note: The full NQVL program is being implemented in multiple iterations, each with its own solicitation. The present solicitation applies only to the Design and Implementation phases of the Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) component. The full scope across all three phases of this component is outlined here to help prospective proposers decide on the scale and scope of their proposals to this solicitation within the context of anticipated future goals for the entire program.

The Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects form the scientific and technological core efforts the NQVL is designed to enable. Each QSTD project will have identified a technology goal that has the potential for demonstrating quantum advantage that could lead to translation in the near term. Each project will also have identified a potential pathway for achieving this goal, including the basic science from which the pathway derives, the participants and skill-sets critical for the success of the project, and the user community that will derive the benefit. The phase-wise development that is planned for each project recognizes that this is a fluid process. Plans proposed at the beginning will have to be modified as detailed design and then implementation proceeds. Challenges are to be expected and must be addressed in the time allowed. Additional members with special expertise may need to be included to address these gaps. Feedback from potential users may suggest modifications necessary to deliver a useful end product. And systems engineering steps along the way may dictate changes and/or suggest improvements that speed up the process. The NQVL infrastructure provides the framework through which these changes can be implemented smoothly and quickly. In addition, the NQVL infrastructure will foster essential collaboration, coordination, and cooperation between the various QSTD projects, which might have a different technology focus. This will help identify gaps that apply to more than just a single project, thus magnifying the impact of developments along the way. Activities in areas of common interest or capabilities that benefit more than one QSTD project may be supported separately to maximize synergies and optimize resource allocations. It is also possible that these supporting developments could in turn lead to their own applications independently of the quantum advantage goal. Support for the acquisition or development and implementation of research infrastructure may also be included. The QSTD projects will also develop effective strategies for education and workforce development.

The QSTD projects fall into the category of long-duration NSF investments that require substantial funding over multiple award cycles. They are expected to be developed in three phases: Pilot, Design, and Implementation. Each phase will evolve into the next as the projects are refined and increasingly focused on prototype development and future translation.

1. The Pilot phase is focused on the development of the conceptual design of the QSTD project. Completion of the Pilot phase is required for submission to the Design and Implementation phases. By the conclusion of the Pilot phase, the team will be expected to have completed the following:

Refine the science questions;
Define requirements and prioritize research objectives;
Identify enabling technologies and risks;
Identify critical partnerships and dependencies;
Develop top-down cost and contingency estimates;
Formulate initial risk assessment;
Draft initial Project Execution Plan; and
Draft initial Education and Workforce Development Plan.
Conceptual Design Review: Nine (9) months into the project, NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Pilot project. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Design phase of the QSTD development process.

The Pilot phase is complete when a package containing the QSTD Conceptual Design and the QISE Strategic Plan on the QSTD topic, together with the draft Project Execution Plan and Education and Workforce Development plan leading to a QSTD Preliminary Design, is received and reviewed by NSF.

2. The Design phase is focused on the preliminary design development of the QSTD project.

The NQVL program recommendation for advancement from the Pilot to the Design phase is required for a proposal submission to the QSTD:Design phase.

A successful Design proposal will incorporate the QSTD preliminary project design, demonstrate technical readiness, and include planning for the total anticipated QSTD project lifetime. Design proposals must also include an appropriately scaled Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed, the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary, the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element, and the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation. A resource-loaded schedule may also be required to support the proposed QSTD system integration funding profile. Projection of implementation costs should be revisited in an updated plan for the implementation component of the QSTD project. The Design phase may take up to two years at a cost of up to $2,000,000 per year.

Specifically, the team will:

Develop enabling technology;
Update risk analysis, develop risk mitigation strategies;
Develop bottom-up cost and contingency estimates;
Develop preliminary operations cost;
Develop Project Management Control System;
Develop preliminary Project Execution Plan;
Develop preliminary Education and Workforce Development Plan; and
Identify key staff.
NSF requires that each Design team includes a professional Project Manager as part of the project leadership.

Preliminary Design Review: Nine (9) months into the project, NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Design project. The purpose of the review will be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Implementation phase of the QSTD development process. The site visit will focus on the technical and project management review of the Design project.

The Design project is eligible for a second year of NSF support. Therefore, a second site visit panel review may be conducted twelve (12) months later.

The Design phase is complete when a package containing the QSTD Preliminary Design, together with the draft Project Execution Plan, Education and Workforce Development plan, and funding request leading to a QSTD Final Design, is received and reviewed by NSF.

3. The Implementation phase includes the final design of the first-generation QSTD system, followed by the system integration and subsequent operations of this initial prototype, while at the same time pursuing the development of the enabling technology for the next-generation QSTD system.

The NQVL program recommendation for advancement from the Design to the Implementation phase is required for a proposal submission to the QSTD:Implementation phase.

The Implementation phase includes two components: first-generation design completion, assembly, and operations (Gen-1) and next-generation technology development (Gen-n). The Gen-1 component will proceed in two stages, locking in the final design (Final Design stage), followed by developing the first prototype and assembling and enabling the first users, or operations (Operations stage). It is expected that the subsequent Gen-n phase will proceed simultaneously with the Operations stage as the developers build off the experience gained with actual use, as envisioned in the co-design approach.

For the Final Design stage, the QSTD proposal demonstrates that the enabling research and technology development for the first-generation QSTD system integration project is completed, and that bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed. The QSTD system integration budget estimate for the first-generation QSTD is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.) Key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration. Commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed. The largest and most complex projects are encouraged to use appropriately scaled Earned Value Management reporting during system integration and should prepare an Earned Value Management System during this phase in readiness for system integration.

During the Final Design stage, with a duration of two years, the team will:

Harden key technologies;
Refine bottom-up cost and contingency estimates;
Finalize risk assessment and mitigation plan;
Finalize Project Management plan;
Develop Project Execution Plan (PEP);
Finalize Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP); and
Complete recruitment of key staff.
During the Final Design stage, the team may have Monthly Oversight meetings with NSF program staff. The team may be required to submit Intermediate Reports monthly via Research.gov.

Final Design Review: NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Implementation project eighteen (18) months into the award period. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Operations stage of the QSTD Implementation phase.

The NQVL program recommendation is required for advancement from the Final Design stage to the Operations stage of the QSTD:Implementation phase.

During the Operations stage, the team activities will focus on:

System integration, testing, commissioning of the QSTD;
Operations and user support once a QSTD system is accepted by NSF; and
Development of the technology needed for and design for the next-generation QSTD.
During all activities in the Implementation phase, the team may have Monthly Oversight meetings with NSF program staff. The team will be required to submit Intermediate Reports quarterly via Research.gov.

NSF may conduct annual site visit panel reviews of each QSTD:Implementation project in the Operations stage. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team and provide feedback.

QSTD awards for projects in the Implementation phase will be in the form of cooperative agreements that contain terms and conditions specific to the nature and risks associated with the project.

Each phase of the QSTD projects will follow on the previous phase and constitutes the next step in the refinement of the project. At each phase proposals will be invited only from those teams, or combinations thereof, who have participated in the previous phase. The Implementation phase can be expected to last for six years, with a possibility of one renewal, at a cost between $7,000,000 and $10,000,000 per year.

The following language applies to the technical review of all phases of all QSTD projects:

Scientific Review
Proposals are considered first based on their science goals and their potential of translation from laboratory to practice. Given the significant resources required to execute a QSTD project and the fact that a QSTD project will extend for more than a single award cycle, the scientific goals and the specific outcomes must be compelling and clearly articulated in the proposal. NSF proposal review panels will conduct a comparative review of all proposals submitted to the NQVL program in a given fiscal year. The review panels may be asked to consider the programmatic balance of investments across the full NQVL program.

Technical and Project Management Review
The feasibility of the proposed activities will be reviewed thoroughly. Given the scale and complexity of most large NSF investments a separate panel may assess the implementation plans outlined in the proposal. As QSTD proposals will likely include acquisition, technology development or fabrication activities, the proposal review may consider technical readiness, risk mitigation, project management plans, budgets, and schedules. For long-duration projects with a lifetime possibly exceeding a single award period, contingent on selection in a subsequent development phase, the technical review may also consider performance schedules and the planning for the total anticipated number of system integration and development cycles in the QSTD project, including possible operations. For renewal proposals, the record of success in achieving any previous set of milestones will be taken into consideration. As needed, these reviews may involve site visits. In all cases, the technical review panel will be asked to consider and provide guidance to the Program on the appropriate duration of the award and milestones needed to evaluate progress.

Education and Workforce Development Plan Review
The NQVL program seeks to identify and promote effective education and workforce development strategies that promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. All three phases of the QSTD project development process, i.e. the Conceptual, Preliminary, and the Final Designs of the QSTD project, are required to include appropriately scaled education and workforce development plans for training diverse talent in the workforce in QISE. Examples of activities as part of the Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP) may include, but are not limited to: i) QISE-centric curricula (K through Graduate level); ii) opportunities for students to interact with industry partners, for example through collaboration on research projects, internships, fellowships or entrepreneurial activities; iii) effective and evidence based educational approaches leading to development of skilled and diverse talent in the QISE workforce through formal and informal education; or iv) up-skilling and re-skilling working professionals. A dedicated E&WDP review will be conducted at each stage of the QSTD project development process. The E&WDP implementation will be reviewed annually once the QSTD:Implementation project reaches the Operations stage. The Education and Workforce Development Plan is intended as a living document that will be updated as needed.

Award Oversight
QSTD awards beyond the Pilot phase will be made through cooperative agreements that contain terms and conditions specific to the nature and risks associated with the project. These may involve site visits or mid-term reviews, and NSF approval of changes in management or schedule. Oversight will include monitoring progress towards any milestones established during the technical review. The duration of support will be determined based on the scientific goals of the project with input from the technical review and will consider the financial burden on the NQVL program. Proposals for continued support may involve both scientific and technical review, as appropriate at the time of the proposal submission. Appropriate close-out should be planned. For the largest investments a close-out phase may be described in the cooperative agreement.

General Review Criteria

All QSTD proposals will be evaluated using the NSF merit review criteria concerning intellectual merit and broader impacts, as well as an assessment as to how well the proposed QSTD project will address the stated science goals and QSTD impacts. Consideration of all QSTD projects begins by evaluating and prioritizing the science goals within the NQVL, and by determining the feasibility of the implementation plan. For each of the relevant phases – Pilot, Design, and Implementation – the associated deliverables from the previous phase will be reviewed before advancing on to the next phase. At each phase of development, the NSF may choose to provide support through the next phase or end its involvement. At successive development phases, the reviews will be increasingly more detailed and will involve an increasing level of commitment from the NSF. Project planning must take into account the total project lifetime. The NSF investment in any one QSTD project is of finite duration.

NSF has as one of its over-arching principles the fostering of diverse talent across the scientific community. All QSTD proposals submitted through any of the solicitations issued as part of the NQVL program will be required to identify steps that will be taken to promote this goal and can expect to be reviewed as to how well this is being addressed.

Review of the QSTD proposal and subsequent oversight of QSTP awards will scale with the size and complexity of the proposed project as described in the 2021 Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) NSF 21-107, or subsequent revisions in effect at time of proposal submission found at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp. Prospective PIs are strongly encouraged to familiarize with Chapter 5 of the Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) for guidance on planning and oversight requirements relevant to QSTD projects. The guidelines listed here follow standard practices for activities of this scope.

The Design and Implementation phases of a QSTD project will be conducted in the following sequence:

Design phase: NSF aims to support up to eight (8) Design projects with a duration of up to two years, at the level of up to $2,000,000 per year. The number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress.

Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. Advancing from the QSTD:Pilot to the QSTD:Design phase, the Lead Organization and the Lead PI may change subject to the eligibility limits on number of proposals per organization and per PI or co-PI stated in this solicitation.

The QSTD Pilot teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other and synergies are strongly encouraged. Following upon a clear and agreed-upon understanding of goals and objectives, the selection of a Lead Organization, and approval by the NSF to advance from the Pilot to the Design phase, QSTD Pilot teams may choose to consolidate prior to submitting a QSTD Design proposal to advance to the Design phase.

Implementation phase: NSF aims to support up to six (6) Implementation projects with a duration of six years. The level of NSF support for QSTD Implementation projects will scale with the complexity of the QSTD project but is expected to range between $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 per project per year. The number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress. The QSTD Implementation projects are eligible for a one-time six-year renewal, contingent upon the quality of a new proposal and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress.

Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. Advancing from the QSTD:Design to the QSTD:Implementation phase, the Lead Organization and the Lead PI may change subject to the eligibility limits on number of proposals per organization and per PI or co-PI stated in this solicitation.

The QSTD Design teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other and synergies are strongly encouraged. Following upon a clear and agreed-upon understanding of goals and objectives, the selection of a Lead Organization, and approval by the NSF to advance from the Design to the Implementation phase, QSTD Design teams may choose to consolidate prior to submitting a QSTD Implementation proposal to advance to the Implementation phase.

NSF requires that the leadership of each Implementation team separates roles and responsibilities with respect to the scientific and project management components of the QSTD project. The Project Manager will be solely in charge of delivering each QSTD generation on time and on budget.

Each QSTD Implementation team will maintain the QISE Strategic Plans on the specific topic of the QSTD project. QISE community town hall meetings may be convened at annual intervals. Specific details may be project dependent and will be captured in the QSTD Community Outreach plan with the overarching goal of fostering an open scientific dialogue and ensuring the broad participation of the entire QISE community.

As indicated above, the QSTD Implementation teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other. Synergies are strongly encouraged.

"The [Name of PI's Organization] group is a member in good standing of the [Name of Collaboration], including Dr. [insert the full name of the Principal Investigator] as a member of that group."

Departure from this format may result in the proposal being returned without review.

Data Management and Sharing Plan

In addition to the PAPPG requirements regarding the management and sharing of data products resulting from NQVL activities, and in alignment with the National Science and Technology Council report on "Guidance for Implementing National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33)" and the National Security Memorandum 10 (NSM-10), NQVL proposals should also include in the Data Management and Sharing Plan a description of how any proprietary information or intellectual property will be managed. This description may include a discussion of how data will be shared with project partners and affiliates, how access to the data will be managed, and how the sensitivity of various data sets will be assessed. Research security concerns are relevant for NQVL projects because quantum technologies have the potential to impact U.S. economic and national security interests.

Collaborators and Other Affiliations Information

PIs should carefully follow the instructions regarding preparation of the Collaborators and Other Affiliations (COA) form provided at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/coa.jsp. A COA form in .xlsx format only must be submitted as a Single Copy Document for each individual identified as senior/key personnel of the QSTD team. For large collaborations or authorships, the form should only list those people with whom the senior/key personnel have collaborated in a direct and substantive way. Senior/key personnel with questions regarding whom they should list in their COA form should contact the cognizant NQVL Program Officer(s). Note in this context that listing a collaboration name or providing a collaboration URL is not sufficient.

Proposals that deviate from the required elements of this solicitation (or other items listed in the PAPPG) may be returned without review.

Additional Information for QSTD Proposals

PIs are reminded that the goal of the NQVL program is to accelerate progress towards demonstrations of practical quantum advantage, using a convergent, systems engineering, and co-design approach. The Program is committed to supporting use-inspired scientific research and technology development for the benefit of the national economy and to strengthen the Nation's strategic, scientific, and technological preeminence.

PIs are required to contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) at National Quantum Virtual Laboratory, telephone: 703-292-8235 or email: NQVL@nsf.gov as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, in order to determine the level of readiness for submission to the appropriate QSTD phase as well as the appropriate structure of the QSTD proposal in terms of possible supplementary documents and/or page-limit extensions.

PIs should consult Chapter 5 of the Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) for guidance on planning and oversight requirements relevant to QSTD projects.

QSTD proposals must clearly describe:

What: QSTD vision describing the specific Science and/or Technology area that is the focus of the translation to be supported under the NQVL program and who might be the potential users.
Why: Scientific and technology challenges that can be addressed effectively only by a QSTD project.
How: Plan of activities to address technical challenges.
Who: Team with the organizational, scientific, technical, and sociocultural skills, trusted and respected by the QISE community.
Readiness: Evidence that the QSTD project is feasible in the time and with the resources afforded by the NSF NQVL program.
Community: Plans for engaging the QISE community in the QSTD planning and execution, for fostering education and workforce development, and for promoting the full spectrum of diverse talent in the QISE community.
Partnerships: Dependencies. Synergies. Leverage other NQI-relevant investments by NSF or other U.S. Federal agencies. Public-private partnerships.
Management and Coordination: Roles and responsibilities of all senior/key personnel. Deliverables. Timeline. Milestones.
Outcomes.
Metrics of Success.
Additional Information for QSTD Design Proposals

At the Design phase, the proposal must contain the QSTD preliminary project design and include planning for the total anticipated QSTD project lifetime. Proposals must also include an appropriately scaled Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed, the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary, the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element, and the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation. A resource-loaded schedule may also be required to support the proposed QSTD system integration funding profile. Projection of operating costs should be revisited in an updated plan for the operations component of the QSTD project.

Additional Information for QSTD Implementation Proposals

At the Implementation phase, the QSTD proposal demonstrates that the enabling research and technology development for the first-generation QSTD system integration project is completed, and that bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed. The QSTD system integration budget estimate for the first-generation QSTD is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.) Key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration. Commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed. The largest and most complex projects are encouraged to use appropriately scaled Earned Value Management reporting during system integration and should prepare an Earned Value Management System during this phase in readiness for system integration.

VI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures
Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.

A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.

Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.

One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.

NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria
The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.

1. Merit Review Principles

These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:

All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.
NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.
Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.
With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.

These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.

2. Merit Review Criteria

All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.

The two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.

When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:

Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:

What is the potential for the proposed activity to
Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management and Sharing Plan and the Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.

Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria

Design phase: The NSF proposal review at this phase will focus on project-related aspects such as budgets and project management, and will evaluate, as appropriate to this level:

the preliminary Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed;
the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary;
the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element;
the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation; and
the preliminary Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP).
The Program may seek additional reviews to evaluate the technical scope and costs at a level commensurate with preliminary design.

Implementation phase: The NSF proposal review at this phase will focus on reliability of cost estimates and technical readiness, as evidenced by the following:

the QSTD:Implementation proposal demonstrates that enabling research and technology development is completed;
any bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed;
the QSTD system integration budget estimate is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.);
key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration;
commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed; and
the final Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP) is satisfactory.
The Program may seek additional reviews to evaluate the technical scope and costs at a level commensurate with final design.

B. Review and Selection Process
Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.

Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.

After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new recipients may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.

After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.

Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.

VII. Award Administration Information
A. Notification of the Award
Notification of the award is made to the submitting organization by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)

B. Award Conditions
An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.

*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-8134 or by e-mail from nsfpubs@nsf.gov.

Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Build America, Buy America

As expressed in Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers (86 FR 7475), it is the policy of the executive branch to use terms and conditions of Federal financial assistance awards to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States.

Consistent with the requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act (Pub. L. 117-58, Division G, Title IX, Subtitle A, November 15, 2021), no funding made available through this funding opportunity may be obligated for infrastructure projects under an award unless all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. For additional information, visit NSF's Build America, Buy America webpage.

C. Reporting Requirements
For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final annual project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.

Failure to provide the required annual or final annual project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.

PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final annual project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.

More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.

About The National Science Foundation
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."

NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.

NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.

Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide Chapter II.F.7 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.
