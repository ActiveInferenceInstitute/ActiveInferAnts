### 1. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION

**1.A. Program Overview**  
Cyber attacks are increasing in quantity and severity. Some of the most sophisticated and persistent cyber attacks are primarily human-driven. However, most cyber defenses do not consider the human attributes and limitations of attackers. Furthermore, most existing defenses focus on blocking suspicious behavior and few initiate interactions with a suspected attacker to understand their attributes, skills, or goals, let alone, induce changes in their behavior.

1. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts
through the BAA process. The use of a BAA solicitation allows a wide range of innovative ideas
and concepts. The BAA will appear on https://sam.gov/, Contract Opportunities, on the NAVWAR
Contracts Directorate Website (https://e-commerce.dc3n.navy.mil/), and the IARPA website at
http://www.iarpa.gov/. The following information is for those wishing to respond to this Program
BAA.
This BAA is for the Reimagining Security with Cyberpsychology-Informed Network Defenses
(ReSCIND) program. The Government is seeking innovative solutions for the ReSCIND program
in this BAA. ReSCIND is envisioned to be a 45-month effort, beginning approximately November
2023.
1.A. Program Overview
Cyber attacks are increasing in quantity and severity. Some of the most sophisticated and persistent
cyber attacks are primarily human-driven. However, most cyber defenses do not consider the
human attributes and limitations of attackers. Furthermore, most existing defenses focus on
blocking suspicious behavior and few initiate interactions with a suspected attacker to understand
their attributes, skills, or goals, let alone, induce changes in their behavior.
The Reimagining Security with Cyberpsychology-Informed Network Defenses (ReSCIND)
Program focuses on inducing or intensifying cognitive biases or other cognitive limitations to
thwart cyber attackers through both novel network and host-based technologies. Rather than just
attempting to detect and stop suspicious movement on the network, Offerors will propose
innovative solutions to increase the effort and resources spent by cyber attackers by impacting
their decision-making. The ReSCIND Program seeks novel methods that:
1. Identify, and provide evidence of, Cognitive Vulnerabilities (CogVulns) relevant to cyber
attackers;
2. Understand, measure, and induce changes in cyber attack behavior and success;
3. Develop Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs) impacting both early and late stage
attacks;
4. Create Cyber-specific Computational Cognitive Model(s) (C3M)2
that reflect and predict
attacker behavior; and
5. Produce Adaptative Psychology-informed Defenses (APhiDs) which automate the preferred
sequence of CyphiDs based on observed attacker behavior.
Cyberpsychology integrates human behavior and decision-making into the cyber domain to
understand, anticipate, and influence cyber behavior. There is a vast amount of cognitive and

psychology. ISBN 978-0521674102.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 5 of 88
behavioral science research that can be applied to cybersecurity to improve defensive posture. The
ReSCIND program aims to develop CyphiDs that leverage an understanding of attacker decisionmaking, human limitations, and cognitive biases to reduce attack effectiveness. ReSCIND will
rebalance the inherent asymmetry of cyber defense by exploring novel methods for manipulating
attacker behavior during various phases of the Cyber Kill Chain3
.
As notionally represented in Figure 1, ReSCIND will provide defenders a much-needed advantage
by expanding the cyber defense toolkit by specifically leveraging well-established cognitive
vulnerabilities (e.g., decision-making biases, mental model heuristics) that can be intensified and
manipulated to impede cyber attackers. Offerors will propose novel approaches informed by social
science research and associate CyphiDs to observables (e.g., attacker attributes, situational
attributes, network and host characteristics) to measurably disrupt cyber attack behavior across the
various stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.
Figure 1: Notional graphic of cyber defense with and without ReSCIND
1.A.1. Technical Challenges and Objectives (TCO)
The objective of the ReSCIND Program is to impose a cyber penalty against attackers and increase
the effort and difficulty for them to achieve their goals. Technical challenges and objectives
include:
1. Identify and provide evidence of CogVulns relevant to cyber attack behavior. In the ReSCIND
Program, cognitive vulnerability is an umbrella term encompassing cognitive and decision3 Lockheed Martin (2015). White Paper Seven Ways to Apply the Cyber Kill Chain® with a Threat Intelligence Platform,

ReSCIND Program BAA Page 6 of 88
making biases, innate cognitive limitations, emotional or mental state, or physiological
vulnerabilities that can result in reduced cyber attacker success or effectiveness. Offerors must
propose their plan for novel research exploring dynamic cyber attack scenarios with skilled
human participants. Observable environmental features, attacker attributes, mission context,
network and host characteristics that may impact the defensive utility of selected CogVulns
must be identified. Performers will:
• Establish relevance of vulnerabilities to cyber attackers, accounting for relevant differences
among individuals through theoretical and experimental research.
• Design and execute empirically and statistically efficient experimental designs with cyberskilled human participants to explore cyberpsychology in dynamic cyber attack tasks.
• Produce a CogVuln Playbook--a non-interactive structured representation that depicts
hypothesized and confirmed relationships among CogVulns, bias sensors and triggers,
relevant characteristics of the attacker, the network, and the external environment, and
various cyber behavioral impacts (See Table 7).
2. Understand, measure, and induce changes in cyber attack behavior and success. Offerors
will propose hypothesized relationships between CogVulns, bias sensors that identify and
measure them, and bias triggers that create cyber situations to induce and intensify
CogVulns. Performers will experimentally establish which selected CogVulns, bias sensors,
and bias triggers produce a measurable effect on cyber attack behavior. Performers will:
• Develop approaches to exploit cyber attacker CogVulns for defensive gain.
• Understand the extent to which CogVulns may overlap and the precedent factors that lead
to CogVulns in cyber-specific situations.
• Identify novel techniques to measure, predict, and influence attacker behavior to thwart
success.
• Create bias signature(s), which maps cyber data to the presence of or increase in a specific
cognitive vulnerability.
• Develop bias sensors using data likely to be available to defenders in a realistic
environment (e.g., PCAP, IDS alerts).
• Establish bias sensor reliability and validity using established methodologies. Develop
triggers (host/network manipulations) which can reliably induce or exacerbate CogVulns.
3. Develop a collection of cyberpsychology-informed defenses (CyphiDs), each including a set of
bias sensors and bias triggers focused on a cyber behavioral impact, for both early and late
stages of a cyber attack. Offerors will propose a set of CyphiDs that will demonstrate
measurable impact on cyber attacker performance and success through exploitation of robust
and measurable CogVulns. Sets of improved or newly created bias sensor and bias triggers will
be incorporated by performers into the CyphiDs, based on the CogVulns established as an
output in TCO 2. Performers will:
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 7 of 88
• Enhance the CogVuln Playbook to display the nature of the relationships between the
CogVulns and CyphiDs to defensive goals and measurable impacts on cyber attack
behavior.
• Implement the logic and software of cyberpsychology-informed defenses (CyphiDs) for
testing in the cyber range testbed, incorporating relevant insights from the CogVuln
Playbook.
• Demonstrate CyphiD efficacy for slowing or reducing the impact of cyber attack attempts.
• Develop success metrics for each CyphiD, both pre and post trigger, to evaluate the
impact of the CyphiD on human-focused cyber behavior and attacker success for both
early and late stages of a cyber attack.
4. Create cyber-specific computational cognitive models (C3M) that reflect and predict attacker
behavior changes in reaction to CyphiD interventions. The models must respond to variation
in CogVulns as measured by the bias sensors, such that they adapt to both raising and
lowering relevant attributes using available data. The models will replicate and predict
behavioral changes caused by bias triggers. Performers may elect to use their modeling to
inform development of their APhiD.
• Develop, train, and test novel cyber-specific C3Ms which reflect and predict attacker
behavior, with variability dependent on presence of CogVulns.
• Modeling efforts should also address differences in attacker behavior based on
environmental features, attacker attributes, mission context, network and host
characteristics, or situational factors.
5. Produce an adaptive psychology-informed defenses (APhiD) which includes logic to
automate the selection of multiple CyphiDs over time, based on observed attacker behavior.
Performers will create an adaptive defensive system that automates CyphiD selection to
independently respond to cyber attacker attributes, environmental features, mission context,
and network and host characteristics. Performers will:
• Develop algorithms for APhiD to allow for automated adaptation of CyphiDs.
• Implement the logic and software of APhiD for testing in cyber range testbed,
incorporating relevant insights from the structured visual representation, and previous
experimental results.
• Provide novel generalized defenses for enterprise networks and evidenced-based usecases, including deployment guidelines to highlight each defense’s effectiveness
against various real-world features (e.g., attacker attributes, mission context, network
and host characteristics).

1.B. Program Phases
The ReSCIND program is a 45-month effort, comprised of three (3) phases. Proposals shall
include a solution for all phases and address all technical challenges. Complete proposals will also
include full experimental protocol for Phase 1 human subjects research (HSR) following the
template provided in Appendix 7.A. Proposals that do not include a complete solution for all
phases or do not address all five technical challenges described above will be considered noncompliant and will not be evaluated. The following table provides an overview of the ReSCIND
program structure.
Table 1: An Overview of the ReSCIND Program Structure.
Phase Duration Objective
1 18 months
Identify CogVulns relevant to offensive cyber operators, including
methods to induce, exacerbate, and measure each cognitive
vulnerability.
2 15 months
Research and develop CyphiDs that map to observed attacker attributes
and measurably disrupt cyber attack behavior across the Cyber Kill
Chain and increase the negative impact on attacker performance and
success.
3 12 months
Use experimental results and data from prior phases to develop APhiD
(for automated selection of a combination of CyphiDs) and cyberspecific computational cognitive modeling (C3M) to reflect and predict
the behavioral data provided.
The Test and Evaluation (T&E) Team will conduct several T&E events throughout the life of the
program using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Human Subject Research (HSR)
protocols to evaluate Performer developed solutions. These will consist of controlled experiments
that consider specifics of real-world cyber campaigns to balance internal and external validity.
Much of this data will be made available to Performers for Research and Development (R&D) in
later phases, and eventually, provided to the general scientific community. In addition, Performers
will be required to conduct their own supplemental IRB-approved HSR data collection(s) and
make that data available to the program. Deliverables produced by proposers must grant the
Government intellectual property (IP) rights sufficient to allow the Government to conduct T&E
HSR, publicly distribute performer and T&E generated datasets, and modify and deploy
deliverables. Additional details on program data can be found in Section 6.
1.B.1. Phase 1
The goal of Phase 1 is to identify the CogVulns most relevant to cyber attack behavior based on
foundational scientific research and cyber relevant HSR experimentation, including methods for
inducing, exacerbating, and measuring the CogVulns. Phase 1 requires Performers to research and
develop novel bias sensors to detect these CogVulns using cyber data, and bias triggers to induce
and intensify them in a cyber situation. The ReSCIND Program encourages maximum creativity
and diversity in selection of bias sensors and bias triggers; however, the scope of allowable 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 9 of 88
touchpoints is partially constrained by the data sources available in the cyber range testbed.
Offerors must propose related cyber range testbed observables that they anticipate will be needed
by their CyphiDs.
Bias sensors will use data accessible to cyber defenders to identify which bias trigger is most
appropriate by determining the extent a cyber attacker or cyber task context is susceptible to a
particular CogVuln. Bias sensors will be developed into software components for use on a network
or host where the needed cyber defender data can be made available. Offerors will provide at least
one established method, and optionally a context-specific alternative evaluation methodology, for
T&E validation for each bias sensor delivered. The bias sensors must use data typically available
to cyber defenders, while the established methodologies can use other data sources (e.g.,
psychometric questionnaires) or sensors (e.g., physiological devices).
Phase 1 research and development must include two required CogVulns selected by IARPA, loss
aversion and the representativeness bias, and at least three additional CogVulns proposed by the
Offeror. Selection criteria will include novelty, variety, relevance, quantity, scientific rigor,
potential impact, etc.
For the purpose of this effort, we define the terms as follows:
• Loss aversion4
is the tendency for people to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring
equivalent gains.
• Representativeness bias5
is the tendency to overweight the representativeness of a piece
of evidence while ignoring how often (e.g., its base rate) it occurs.
Performers will develop bias triggers to interact with or adapt to attackers (or portions of the
network or host the attacker accesses) based on observables collected by the bias sensors and create
situations in the cyber domain that induce and exploit each of the CogVulns. A bias trigger will

5 Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1972). Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness. Cognitive Psychology, 3(3),
430–454.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 10 of 88
activate, induce or intensify a CogVuln. This increase should be measurable by a bias sensor or
established method.
Relevant for Phase 1, Offerors should clearly describe:
• The justifications for hypothesizing that each included cognitive vulnerability is
exploitable to reduce cyber attacker effectiveness, and at least one proposed bias sensor
and one bias trigger that can be developed for each, although multiple triggers are preferred.
• Details on how each included vulnerability is relevant to attacker cognition and behavior,
including which stage of the cyber kill chain it pertains to.
• The justifications for hypothesizing that exploiting a subset of the planned vulnerabilities
will, in combination, meet required thresholds for at least one of the cyber behavioral
impact metrics.
• Statistically efficient experimental design plan(s) to fully investigate the CogVulns (at least
5), bias sensors (at least one per CogVuln) and bias triggers (at least one per CogVuln).
• Designs should allow for analysis via traditional inferential statistics. In addition to
quantitative analysis, HSR may include observational and qualitative studies. Sample size
and participant composition must be sufficient to experimentally demonstrate that
identified bias triggers are effective. Appropriate sample size will be dictated by Performer
teams’ experimental design plans but should be the minimum needed to show effects within
the specific design. Any use of non-cyber proficient participants or non-cyber scenarios
must be highly justified; effect sizes must be calculated. Proposals should justify
recruitment strategies, in terms of sample size, demographics, skill levels, etc.
• Initial IRB protocols should be included as an appendix (Attachment 13) to all proposals,
with Performer IRB approval expected within 3 months of program kick-off. Subsequent
HSR or experimental design revisions should be handled with IRB modifications,
addendums, or exemptions.
In Phase 1 Performer will develop a preliminary CogVuln Playbook. Offerors will propose a visual
representation, (e.g., concept map, ontology, taxonomy) to clearly display these relationships, and
include initial hypothesized relationships. CogVuln Playbooks must be driven by theory; a
―shotgun approach will be insufficient. Relevant theory from a variety of disciplines may direct
the research and shall be discussed in the proposal. These playbooks will foster CyphiD
development by acting as a working guide for Performer teams and be refined throughout the
program. While information about individual differences should be included in the playbook,
performers should assume no prior knowledge of the attacker will be provided during evaluations.
Phase 1 shall have a duration of 18 months. Additional requirements include:
• Design and execute bias discovery experiment(s) for selected and required CogVulns;
experimental design and data collection must include a sufficient number of participants to
calculate statistical differences (e.g., effect size, variability) with sufficient skill level to 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 11 of 88
generalize to an expert population. Sample size efficient designs are acceptable; number
of participants, skill level, and recruitment plan must be justified.
• Offerors should account for a sufficient number of cognitive vulnerabilities, bias sensors,
and bias triggers to account for potential construct failure.
• Provide established methods and evaluation thresholds to determine ground truth of
presence of each of the CogVulns.
• Prepare cyber range testbed provided by T&E for inducing and measuring performer
CogVulns, and perform self-testing for bias sensors and triggers.
• Ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB)) approval or exemption will be
required. Performer teams must have access to an ethics review board, and expertise on
navigating the process.
1.B.2. Phase 2
The goal of Phase 2 is to develop novel Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs) to impose
a cyber penalty and thwart attacker success across the Cyber Kill Chain. A set of bias sensors and
bias triggers developed for a specific cognitive vulnerability, or cognitive vulnerability cluster,
will be considered a CyphiD as shown in Figure 2. CyphiDs consist of one or more bias sensors
which measure the presence of a CogVuln, logic to determine based on bias sensor output (and
other cyber data, as needed) which bias trigger to utilize (if any), and one or more trigger(s) which
create a cyber situation to induce, exploit, or intensify the CogVuln. In Phase 2, Performers will
develop the CyphiD software and logic that links sensors and triggers. Offerors must propose a
design for proposed CyphiDs, including logic, proposed mappings of bias sensors to bias triggers,
as well as cyber data required for the sensors, and touchpoints needed for the triggers. For each
CyphiD, offerors must propose success metrics and details on how to measure behavioral impact
for each of the 7 cyber behavioral impacts listed in Table 5. Offerors will also propose which
observable cyber data will be required, what attack scenarios are being targeted, and any other
CyphiD-specific information that is needed to prepare the testbed and T&E experimental design
to evaluate performer solutions.
Additional bias sensors and bias triggers may be developed in Phase 2 based on Phase 1
experimental findings or additional HSR. Offerors should discuss how experimental design(s) will
allow for quick additional HSR in Phase 2, if needed. Performer teams will need to produce at
least 5 CyphiDs that impact early kill chain attacker behavior, and at least 5 CyphiDs that impact
late kill chain behavior (late is defined as post exploitation). A CyphiD that is effective for both
early and late kill chain behavior, may count for both categories. Teaming is strongly encouraged
to accomplish these goals. Performers will create a simple, minimally-interactive, custom
dashboard to visually assist defenders in understanding the findings of the sensors (i.e., the degree
of each cognitive vulnerability measured) and the impact of the CyphiDs. Phase 2 metrics will
focus on achieving a medium effect size across multiple areas of defender goals. It is not expected 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 12 of 88
that each CyphiD meet each cyber behavioral impact requirement threshold (See Table 4), but
rather the Performer’s collection of CyphiDs meets each at least once.
Figure 2: Notional CyphiD Graphic: Bias sensors, bias triggers, and logic combine to form
CyphiDs. Each CyphiD focuses on achieving a desirable cyber behavioral impact.
In Phase 2, Performers will continue to update their CogVulns Playbook and implement relevant
portions into their software to demonstrate under which conditions a particular CyphiD should be
used for the seven cyber behavioral impacts. Attacker attributes and/or situational factors can be
observed by bias sensors and exploited by the CyphiDs, while network and host characteristics
can be altered by the bias triggers. These features should be included in the structural
representation and examined throughout the research.
Self-testing of CyphiDs within the provided cyber range test bed environment will be performed
iteratively by Performers in each performer’s dedicated instance of the cyber range testbed, with
results and interpretation of results delivered to IARPA. A leaderboard will be provided to track 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 13 of 88
the successes of each team’s CyphiDs against the program metrics and will contain both selftesting results, and T&E event results.
Phase 2 shall have a duration of 15 months. Additional requirements include:
• Improve (and/or create new) bias sensors and bias trigger to achieve Phase 2 program
metrics.
• Request and justify any additional cognitive vulnerability-specific metrics to be included
for HSR T&E events.
• Fully document each CyphiD (which will be used across all Performers teams during Phase
3).
1.B.3. Phase 3
The goal of Phase 3 is to automate, model, and improve research findings from previous phases,
while reaching higher effect sizes. Performers will develop an adaptive psychology-informed
defense (APhiD), which automatically selects the appropriate combination or sequence of
CyphiDs over time (See Figure 3). Performers will also research and develop novel Cyber-specific
Computational Cognitive Models (C3Ms) based on experimental findings to date; successful
models will reflect and predict cyber attacker behavior with sensitivity to various conditions listed
in the static visual representation and adjust based on bias sensor measurements of each CogVuln.
In Phase 3, all Performers will be working from an integrated CogVuln Playbook provided by the
IARPA team that is based on elements from each Performer team’s Phase 1 and 2 contributions.
Performers will incorporate relevant portions of the CogVuln Playbook to provide a priori
knowledge to the APhiD and determine situations in which a particular CyphiD would be selected, 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 14 of 88
including various attacker attributes, attacker behaviors, network and host characteristics,
situational attributes, and/or time factors.
Figure 3: Notional APhiD Graphic: Multiple CyphiDs combined with logic determining which
to use at each point in time form an APhiD.
APhiD must run autonomously by creating intelligent algorithm(s) (e.g., expert system, game
theory, artificial intelligence, rule-based system) to select the optimal combination or sequence of
CyphiDs throughout an extended period of time. IARPA will provide Performers teams with an
annotated and labeled dataset for training their APhiD, as well as all available Performers team
CyphiDs for optional inclusion. Performers will use the dataset(s) provided by IARPA, as well as
Performers data and findings from their Phase 1 HSR, to develop C3Ms and APhiD. Offerors must
propose an initial design, implementation, and self-testing plan for their APhiD to automate
CyphiD usage and improve cyber behavioral impact.
The C3Ms will focus on the CogVulns examined by the Performers in Phase 2. The anticipated
changes in behavior caused by each of the Performer’s CyphiDs should be handled by at least one
model. Models must use ecologically relevant sensor measurements, which can be reasonably
obtained in cyber security environments such as security operations centers (SOCs). C3Ms should
model an adjustable degree of CogVuln on a continuous scale, such that the model behavior
changes based on the degree of CogVuln presence selected in the model. Excessively complex
non-linear models are discouraged due to overfitting concerns. Performers may include their
C3M(s) as part of their APhiD logic. Offerors must propose an initial design, implementation, and 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 15 of 88
self-testing plan for the C3M(s) to recapitulate the pattern of human behavior as it relates to
decision-making and CogVuln-specific behavioral changes in a cyber attack scenario.
Phase 3 shall have a duration of 12 months. Additional requirements include:
• Store, process, and understand the large-scale HSR dataset provided by IARPA
• Provide CyphiDs with documentation across all Performer teams.
• Validate APhiD with self-testing in cyber range testbed and submit findings and
interpretation.
• Develop simple, minimally-interactive, custom dashboard to visually present and help endusers understand how sensors, triggers, and APhiD are working and their impact on attack
behavior.
• Develop a sufficient number of C3M(s) to define and emulate all the CogVulns included
in CyphiDs by the Performer during Phase 2.
• Perform iterative testing of cognitive models against the training data provided, report all
data and interpretations of data and analyses to IARPA.
• Provide updates to the common CogVulns Playbook based on findings and interpretation
of results.
1.C. Team Expertise
To address the combination of challenges presented by ReSCIND, collaborative efforts and
teaming arrangements among Offerors are strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams
will be multidisciplinary and may include expertise in one or more of the disciplines listed below.
This list is included only to provide guidance for the Offerors; satisfying all the areas of technical
expertise below is not a requirement for selection and unconventional or innovative team expertise
may be needed based on the proposed research. Specific content, communications, networking,
and team formations are the sole responsibility of the participants. Proposals should include a
description and the mix of skills and staffing that the Offeror determines will be necessary to carry
out the proposed research and achieve program metrics.
• Behavioral science and cognitive
psychology
• Defensive cyber operations
• Cognitive modeling
• Cyber attack modeling
• Penetration testing/red teaming and
adversary emulation
• Artificial intelligence and adaptive
systems
• Statistical data analysis and
mathematical modeling
• Software development and
engineering
• Criminology
• Cognitive and neurosciences
• Human factors engineering
• Human computer interaction

1.D. Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals shall explicitly address all the following:
• Underlying Theory: Proposed strategies to meet program-specified metrics must have
firm theoretical bases that are described with enough detail that reviewers will be able to
assess the viability of the approaches. Proposals shall properly describe and reference
previous work upon which their approach is founded.
• Research & Development Approach: Proposals shall describe the technical approach to
meeting program metrics.
• HSR Protocols: Proposal shall describe the approach for recruiting human subjects and
ensuring ethical treatment and responsible data handling in Attachment 13 (See Appendix
7.A template). Experimental procedures must discuss and justify design decisions
supporting or limiting internal, external, ecological and construct validity. Protocols for the
ReSCIND program should be new IRB submissions, and not modifications of an existing
protocol.
• IRB Approval: Proposal shall describe the approach for, and experience in, obtaining
timely IRB approval for all phases of experimentation and any required modifications;
Performer teams must ensure IRB approval from their IRB authority as well as government
concurrence prior to conducting HSR.
• Data Analysis Strategy: Proposals shall describe how HSR protocols will yield data that
can meet program metrics through both qualitative and conventional statistical analyses 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 17 of 88
and articulate the reasoning behind any nonparametric or otherwise atypical analytical
approaches. Data collection, storage, labeling and analysis plans shall be included.
• Technical Risks and Mitigations: Proposals shall identify technical risks and proposed
mitigation strategies for each.
• Software Development: Proposals shall describe the approach to software architecture and
integration.
The following areas of research are out of scope for the ReSCIND program:
• Research that does not have strong theoretical and experimental foundations.
• Research that cannot be implemented to facilitate identification or development of a
CyphiD.
• CyphiDs or APhiDs that require the live access to the Internet.
• Bias sensors or triggers designed to solely target a non-human cyber attacker.
• Bias triggers that do not have a cyber behavioral impact.
• Technologies focused solely on cyber deception or traditional cyber defenses.
• Attacker activity that occurs prior to initial network access (e.g., OSINT target research)
• Attacker activity relying on interaction with live humans (e.g., social engineering,
phishing), including defenders or users.
• Hardware solutions.
• Attribution of specific ATPs or cyber actors; techniques solely focused on intelligent
gathering.
• Approaches that require access to classified information or data. All Performer research
will be strictly unclassified.
• Design and development of a new interactive human machine interface (HMI).
• Development of a simulated or emulated cyber range testbed is out of scope.
• CyphiDs that only work on a simulated network and not an operational network.
1.E. Test and Evaluation (T&E)
T&E will be conducted by an independent team of FFRDC, UARC or Government staff carrying
out evaluation and analyses of Performer research deliverables using program tests and protocols.
In addition to independent T&E, the program will regularly gauge interim progress of Performer
research activities towards ReSCIND objectives and target metrics using T&E results measured
and reported by the Performer teams themselves. The ReSCIND Program will pursue rigorous and
comprehensive T&E to ensure that research outcomes are well characterized, and deliverables are
aligned with program objectives. Such T&E activities will not only inform Government
stakeholders on ReSCIND research progress but will also serve as valuable feedback to the
Performers to improve their research approaches and system development. The ReSCIND
Program will work closely with Government leaders in cyber operations and cyberpsychology to
continually refine and improve T&E methodologies.
A series of HSR experiments will be conducted by T&E throughout the program to test Performer
solutions and generate datasets. These HSR experiments will be used to evaluate the effectiveness
of the Performer’s capability at various stages of the program. Performers will also be required to
demonstrate execution of their developed capabilities (i.e., bias sensors, bias triggers, CyphiDs, 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 18 of 88
APhiDs) using the provided cyber range testbed (e.g., an independent T&E-hosted and configured
instance of CyberVAN). This DoD-funded cyber range testbed will provide T&E the framework
for creating a robust and realistic testbed for the program. Performer teams will not access this
T&E instance, nor be provided full details of the T&E configuration, which will be used to
independently evaluate Performer deliverables. An instance of CyberVAN will be made available
to Performers 2 as Government Furnished Information (GFI) for self-testing of functionality and
integration by Phase 1 Month 10 and should not be relied on for Performer HSR. Information
provided in proposals about necessary network and host characteristics, data sources, and trigger
touchpoints for the cyber range testbed will be used by T&E for configuration changes.
Phase 1: To meet the goals of phase 1, Performers will conduct their own HSR in Phase 1; this
will occur independently from the Program’s cyber range testbed. Phase 1 Performers HSR should
be a proof of concept demonstrating in which cyber attack task(s) each bias trigger is most
effective. Performers’ initial experimental designs will be assessed with a T&E rubric by a group
of subject matter experts (SMEs) as a midterm T&E event for Phase 1.
The final experimental execution, data analysis, and interpretation of findings done by Performers
will be evaluated with a T&E rubric by a group of SMEs as the final T&E event for Phase 1. The
data analysis must include both qualitative and quantitative results. Raw and curated data collected
by Performers to measure effect size must be provided to T&E for validation. Bias sensors and
triggers will be evaluated for integration into the cyber range testbed. Additionally, the accuracy
of the bias sensors will be evaluated by examining the extent to which bias sensor results reflect
previously established and validated measures, which refer to approaches that are widely used and
well-accepted among related fields of research to accurately measure the outcome of interest. The
bias sensors must use data typically available to cyber defenders, while the established
methodologies can use other data sources and sensors. T&E may also include additional
established methods and/or independent approaches as part of their evaluation. The T&E team will
validate that bias triggers have the desired behavioral effect on attacker behavior (i.e., induce,
increase/decrease a specific CogVuln) by examining effect size.
Phase 2: To meet the goals of Phase 2, controlled HSR experiments with cyber experts will be
executed by T&E. Phase 2 evaluation consists of large-scale HSR with cyber attack experts to
demonstrate statistical and practical significance of the CyphiDs. The first T&E event will focus
on Early Kill Chain CyphiDs (reconnaissance though initial exploitation), and the later event on
the late Kill Chain CyphiDs (post exploitation). As part of T&E, cyber experts will be directed to
perform tasks such as: network reconnaissance and penetration, target discovery and selection,
delivery, exploitation, persistence, defensive evasion, command and control, pivoting, privilege
escalation, credential access, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and other standard
penetration testing tasks. Phase 2 T&E will also include evaluation of new (or improved) bias
sensors; if any new HSR data is collected by Performers, it will also be provided to T&E and effect
sizes calculated.
Phase 3: To meet the goals of Phase 3, T&E evaluation will focus on the predictive power of the
models and generalizability of APhiDs. T&E will use typical model fitting metrics (See Table 5) 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 19 of 88
to examine how C3Ms reflect the data provided and will examine the predictive power of the C3M
using a testing dataset.
To evaluate the Adaptative Psychology-informed Defenses (APhiDs) in Phase 3, an online open
prize competition in the format of a capture-the-flag (CTF) T&E event will be held to test
Performer solutions against a wider range of attack behaviors and attacker attributes.
Experimental analysis results will be utilized to iteratively improve the cyberpsychology-inspired
methods and techniques. Performers are encouraged to work with T&E and propose and justify
additional data to be collected, CogVuln specific metrics needed, CyphiD/APhiD specific flags,
and additional characteristics of the participants to be measured and examined during T&E events,
which may be included at the discretion of the IARPA PM. Additional relevant and reasonable
observables, variables, or metrics that are supported by theory or prior research will be favorably
evaluated. The IARPA Team may conduct other supplemental evaluations or measurements at any
time and without notice.
1.F. Program Data
Across phases, the T&E team will conduct HSR (including data collection/curation) using cyber
experts. These experiments will collect cyber attacker behavior and performance data, though
realistic simulated cyber attack scenarios. During Phase 1, the only data the Performers will obtain
is the data the Performers generate themselves through their bias discovery experiments. During
Phase 2, Performers will again rely on the data they have collected through HSR and self-testing
within the testbed. Results from the Early Kill Chain T&E Event will be provided to Performers
during Phase 2 as GFI and should be used to improve their deliverables for the Late Kill Chain
T&E Event. During Phase 3, the government will provide Performers, as GFI, a more fully curated
dataset created by T&E from the Phase 2 HSR to support both APhiD decision-making and C3M
development. At Phase 3 kick-off Performers will be required to share their CyphiDs across teams
to expand the collection of available options for APhiD selection.
Table 2 describes the data that may be collected by T&E. An updated list of available planned data
will be made available at Phase 1 kickoff. Offerors must notate any additional data requested
relevant to the specific CogVulns, CyphiDs or APhiDs they propose. Performers will develop
CyphiDs and APhiDs for a standard IT network with typical enterprise targets such as, Windows
or Linux operating systems, Domain Controller, Git Repository, routers, development
workstations, database and file share servers, multiple subnets and target environment will not
include removable media, live (benign) users or administrators.

APhiD Data To be included in proposal by Offerors
Performers can expect solutions to defend against cyber attackers using standardized, openly
available cyber attack tools including Kali Linux and included toolsets such as Metasploit,
Armitage, Burpsuite, etc. Attackers will be given high level goals but will not be told how to
execute their attack or strategies to compromise the target network, so any malicious activity
possible on the network may be expected.
Data that is out-of-scope for collection and use in this program include: OSI Layer 1 data, hardware
or infrastructure components, OSINT, social engineering, Internet of Things (IOT), Industrial
Control Systems (ICS) or SCADA devices, mobile/cellular devices, close access or physical
interactions, RFID, radio frequencies, two-factor authentication, and tactical networks. CyphiDs
will not have real-time access to the internet during evaluations.
Performers will be provided attack scenarios to focus on during Phase 1 kick-off. These scenarios
will include enterprise network layout and devices and focus on attack scenarios described in Table
3.

final objective.
1.G. Program Metrics
Achievement of metrics is a performance indicator under IARPA research contracts. IARPA has
defined ReSCIND program metrics to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed solutions in
achieving the stated program goal and objectives and to determine whether satisfactory progress
is being made. The metrics described in this BAA are shared with the intent to scope the effort,
while affording maximum flexibility, creativity, and innovation to Offerors proposing solutions to
the stated problem. Proposals with a plan to exceed the defined metrics in one or more categories
are desirable, provided that all of the other metrics are met, and provided that the proposals provide
clear justification as to why the proposed approach will be able to meet or exceed the enhanced
metric(s).
The final ReSCIND T&E protocols and evaluation methodology are currently under development;
further details will be provided at program kickoff. Program metrics may be refined during the
various phases of the ReSCIND program; if metrics change, revised metrics will be communicated
in a timely manner to Performers. The evaluation methodology may be revised by the Government
at any time during the program lifecycle to better meet program needs.
Phase 1 will include two types of metrics: Statistical metrics and qualitative metrics (Table 4).
Statistical metrics are designed to establish external validity and efficacy of bias sensors and bias
triggers. Qualitative metrics are designed to establish internal validity of the Performers’
experimental design strategies using structured expert evaluations. Effect size, which is sample
size agnostic, will be measured using Cohen’s d; d=M1-M2/SD6
for parametric data, with Cohen’s
d analogs7 used in the case of non-parametric data. The degree to which the bias sensors overlap

Sciences, 5th Ed., Sage Publications, Inc

ReSCIND Program BAA Page 22 of 88
with the validated measure(s) will be measured using standard deviation (SD); SD=√∑(X-µ)2/N)8
.
For Phase 1, an effect size approaching medium is expected. In cases where sensors do not
converge with validated methodologies, using alternative evidence of efficacy may be proposed
by Performers and evaluated by the T&E team using the SME rubric or other strategies. Bias T&E
will account for different interpretations of CogVulns that may be cyber-relevant (e.g., state vs.
trait manifestations of the constructs; cultural variations that may exist) in their evaluations of
Performer solutions. Deliverables must include all details required to replicate data analysis
performed.

Statistical Measures Phase 1 Target
External validity check Bias sensor: within 1.5 SD of baseline
Higher effect size Bias trigger: Cohen’s d ≥ 0.3
Qualitative Metric Phase 1 Evaluation
Manipulation and validity check Experimental design: SME Rubric
Phases 2 and 3 include two types of metrics: Behavioral metrics and statistical metrics (Table 5).
Behavioral metrics are designed to establish that specified defender goals are achieved to decrease
cyber attacker success and effectiveness. Offerors will propose how each behavioral metric can be
determined based on performer-specific CyphiD designs. For example, for a CyphiD targeting the
exfiltration phase of a cyber attack the “Rate of Attack Success” metric could examine the
proportion of attempts that were successful versus those that were unsuccessful (i.e., if 10 files
were successfully exfiltrated in the control condition, then a successful CyphiD would reduce that
to 5 files). While the “Progress Towards Goal” metric could examine how the use of a CyphiD
changed which phase of the Cyber Kill Chain was reached (i.e., if a participant reached the
exploitation phase 10 times when the CyphiD was absent, but only 5 times when the CyphiD was
used). T&E will consider performer proposed behavioral metrics, which may be modified by T&E
and/or combined with additional evaluation metric calculations. Demonstration of cyber
behavioral impact compared to a control condition (without CyphiDs but including traditional
cyber defenses) will indicate that Performer solutions are achieving ReSCIND metrics in Phase 2
and will be improved with automation in Phase 3. Additional comparisons within subjects will
also be performed in all instances where theoretically or analytically appropriate. Medium levels
of effect size will be used to evaluate Phase 2 performance, while an effect size approaching high
is expected in Phase 3Each CyphiD must meet at least one cyber behavioral impact threshold; the
collection of a Performer’s CyphiDs will seek to meet all targets. Phase 3 cognitive computational
models will be evaluated by testing model fit and predictive ability against datasets collected
8 Vogt, W.P. & Johnson, R. B. (2015). The SAGE Dictionary of Statistics & Methodology: A Nontechnical Guide for the Social
Sciences, 5th Ed., Sage Publications, Inc
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 23 of 88
throughout the phases using root mean squared error (RSME= √[ Σ(Pi – Oi)2 / n ])9
for continuous
output. Other standard model efficacy measures may be used by T&E where appropriate.
Subjective measures for CyphiDs and APhiDs will also be considered such as: usability,
adoptability, security, coverage of attack phases and TTPs, and potential interference with
benign users or devices.

1.H. Program Waypoints, Milestones, and Deliverables
Waypoints, Milestones, and Deliverables are established from the program’s onset to ensure
alignment with ReSCIND objectives, organize research activities in a logical and reportable
manner, and facilitate consistent and efficient communication among all stakeholders – IARPA,
ReSCIND T&E, USG Stakeholders, and Research Performers (see Table 6). A schedule of
anticipated key program Milestones and Deliverables is shown in Figure 4. Performers shall

1.I. 9 Software Deliverable Formatting
The ReSCIND Program will use a standardized API for all software deliverables and evaluations.
The first version of the ReSCIND API will be provided to Performers at the Phase 1 Kickoff
Meeting and updated periodically thereafter. The API will define function calls, data structures,
and data pipeline and management for CyphiD and APhiD integration, testing, and operating and
evaluating ReSCIND software in a standardized manner. A secondary API may be necessary for
sensor registration to the testbed itself. The API will be as software and hardware agnostic as is
practical, to ensure Performers can freely develop solutions according to skill and vision.
Each team is required to include among their key personnel a Lead System Integrator (LSI) who
shall be responsible for preparing software deliverable subcomponents, modules, and systems,
performing quality control of deliverable(s), and assisting the T&E team with aspects of
integrating key components into the primary ReSCIND testbed. The LSI will also oversee
communication and coordination across a Performer’s research teams including subcontractors, if
applicable, to ensure research products are functional and following software coding best practices
and requested security controls.
CyphiDs will be designed to be run from within a OCI-compatible Linux container for ease of use
and portability. Deliverables will include the container configuration and all files necessary to run
the CyphiD on both the T&E cyber testbed and on a non-simulated network. Performers are
expected to demonstrate their capabilities on the cyber testbed on a non-simulated network. Final
deliverable for each CyphiD and APhiD will include the full software development package
including any source code, containers, working binary executable, test suite, and documentation.
Binaries for each CyphiD will be shared with other Performers during Phase 3 and used as part of
ReSCIND prize competition.
1.J. Meeting and Travel Requirements
All Performer teams are expected to attend workshops, technical meetings and other designated
meetings to include key personnel from prime and subcontractor organizations.
The ReSCIND program intends to hold a program Kick-off Meeting workshop in the first month
of the program and first month of each subsequent program phase. In addition, the program will
hold PI Review Meetings (three in Phase 1, two in Phase2, and two in Phase 3). Meetings may be
combined for logistical convenience. The dates and locations of these meetings are to be specified
at a later date by the Government, but for planning purposes, Offerors should use the approximate
times listed in Table 6 and assume half the PI and kick-off meetings will be on the East Coast (e.g.,
D.C. area) and half on the West Coast (e.g., San Diego, CA area). IARPA may opt to co-locate the
meeting with a relevant external conference or workshop to increase synergy with stakeholders.
IARPA reserves the right to change meeting locations and conduct additional site visits on an asneeded basis or virtually, if desired.
Kick-off Meetings will typically be one day in duration and will focus on plans for the coming
Phase, Performer planned research, and internal program discussions. PI Review Meetings will
typically be two days in duration and will have a greater focus on communicating program progress 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 30 of 88
and plans to USG stakeholders. These meetings will include additional time allocated to
presentation and discussion of research accomplishments.
In both cases, the workshops will focus on technical aspects of the program and on facilitating
open technical exchanges, interaction, and sharing among the various program participants.
Program participants will be expected to present the technical status and progress of their projects
to other participants and invited guests. Individual sessions for each Performer team with the
ReSCIND PM and T&E Team may be scheduled to coincide with these workshops. Nonproprietary information will be shared by Performers in the open meeting sessions; proprietary
information sharing shall occur during individual breakout sessions with the ReSCIND PM and
T&E.
Site visits by the Government Team will generally take place semiannually during each phase.
These visits will occur at the Performer’s facility. Reports on technical progress, details of
successes and issues, contributions to the program goals, and technology demonstrations will be
expected at such site visits. IARPA reserves the right to conduct additional site visits on an asneeded basis.

2. AWARD INFORMATION:
Research conducted under this project is considered “fundamental research” as defined in 22
C.F.R. § 120.11(8) and 15 C.F.R. § 734.8(c).
The BAA shall result in awards for all Phases of the program. Exercise of the Option Periods shall
depend upon performance during Phase I - Base Period and subsequent Option Periods, as well as
program goals, the availability of funding, and IARPA priorities. Exercising of Phases II – Option
Period 1 and Phase III-Option Period 2 is at the sole discretion of the Government.
Multiple awards are anticipated. Financial resources made available under this BAA shall depend
on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. Multiple awards to the same
Offeror are acceptable provided the proposed techniques are distinct and the proposed personnel
are sufficiently different to achieve the necessary level of effort to complete the work.
The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals
received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The
Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary.
Additionally, the Government reserves the right to accept proposals in their entirety or to select
only portions of proposals for negotiations for award. Evaluation and award of proposals will
follow FAR 35 processes as described herein.
Awards under this BAA shall be made to Offerors based on the Evaluation Factors listed in Section
5 of the BAA, as well as successful completion of negotiations. Proposals selected for negotiation
may only result in a procurement contract.
The Government shall contact Offerors whose proposals are selected for negotiations to obtain
additional information required for award. The Government may establish a deadline for the close
of fact-finding and negotiations that allows a reasonable time for the award of a contract. Offerors
that are not responsive to Government deadlines established and communicated with the request
may be removed from award consideration. Offerors may also be removed from award
consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms,
conditions, and cost/price.
3. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:
3.A. Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.
HistoricallyBlackColleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses
and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit
proposals; however, no portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these organizations’
participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas for exclusive
competition among these entities. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and
Development Centers, University AffiliatedResearch Centers, Government-Owned, Contractor-
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 34 of 88
Operated facilities, Government Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization12
that has a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or
proprietary information or access to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to
submit proposals under this BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by
eligible entities. An entity of which only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligible
to submit a proposal or participate as a team member subject to an organizational conflict of
interest review.
Foreign entities and/or individuals may propose, even as the prime contractor. However, all foreign
participation must comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations,
Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances. Offerors are
expected to ensure that participants do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the
United States, nor its security interests. As such, both foreign and domestic Offerors should
carefully consider the roles and responsibilities of foreign participants as they pursue teaming
arrangements.
3.A.1 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI)
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” means that because of other activities
or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial
assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performingthe contract work
is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to
potential OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (sub awardee,
consultant). Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each
proposal submitted pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as
applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include a
description of the actions the Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of
conflicting roles that might bias the Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an
unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI
in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits contractors/Performers from concurrently providing Scientific
Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar
support services and being a technical Performer. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure
requirement above, address whether an Offeror or an Offeror’s team member (e.g., sub awardee,
consultant) is providing SETA, A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under:
(a) a current award or subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward.
12
 There are instances when these types of entities provide a unique facility, specialized equipment or technical service that is not
otherwise obtainable. In such cases, Offerors can request use and the Government will determine if the resource can be made
available to all Offerors as Government Furnished Property / Equipment/Information / / Capability / Service. If the resource
requested cannot be provided directly by the Government, the Government may consider an Offeror’s request for limited use as a
procured service not otherwise available only after an OCI review and determination. It is advised that the Offeror have an alternate
plan in its proposal in case the Government does not accept the proposed participation. Requests for such resources can be
submitted during the Q&A period.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 35 of 88
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal must include:
• The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
• The prime contract number.
• Identification of proposed team member (sub awardee, consultant) providing the
support.
As part of their proposal, Offerors shall include either (a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates
have any potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in
Appendix A.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized, or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise
selectable under the BAA Evaluation Factors.
The Government may require Offerors to provide additional information to assist the Government
in evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans. If a prospective Offeror believes that any conflict of
interest exists or may exist (whether organizational or otherwise), the Offeror should promptly raise
the issue with the Government by sending his/her contact information and a summary of the
potential conflict by e-mail to the Agency Contact identified herein, before time and effort are
expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan.
If the Government determines that an Offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide
the affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by Government to assist in evaluating the Offeror’s OCI and proposed OCI
mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for
award.
3.A.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Organizations may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the BAA.
However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are selected,
such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can be paid
twice to perform the same task).
3.B. U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or
services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the
sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or
arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate
officials of the institution.”
Offerors must submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter for
each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 36 of 88
serving in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their
technical proposal. Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g.,
President, Chancellor, Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the
Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter is enclosed in APPENDIX A of this BAA. Note that
the Government shall not enter into negotiations with an Offeror whose team includes a U.S.
academic institution until all required Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.
3.C. Other Eligibility Criteria
3.C.1 Collaboration Efforts
Collaborative efforts and teaming arrangements among potential Offerors arestrongly encouraged.

years/quarters) on the right. All milestones shall be clearly labeled on the chart. If
necessary, use multiple pages to ensure legibility of all information.
B. A detailed description of the objectives, scientific relevance, technical approach and
expected significance of the work. Clearly identify the key elements of the proposed work
and how they relate to each other. Describe the technical methods or approachesthat will
be used to meet or exceed each program milestone along with an explanation outlining why
the proposed methods/approaches are feasible. Additionally, describe any anticipated risks
along with possible mitigations. Proposals containing only a general discussion of the
problem without detailed description of approaches, plausibility of implementation, and
critical metrics may be deemed not selectable.
C. State-of-the-art. Compare with the proposed approach to other on-going research,
highlighting the uniqueness of the proposed approach and differences between the
proposed effort and the current state-of-the-art. Identify advantages and disadvantages of
the proposed work with respect to potential alternative approaches.
D. Data sources. Identify and describe data sources to be utilized in pursuit of the stated
research goals.
Offerors proposing to use existing data sets shall provide written verification that said data
sets were obtained in accordance with U.S. laws and, where applicable, use will be in
compliance with End User License Agreements, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and
laws and policies regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Offerors proposing to
obtain new data sets shall ensure that their plan for obtaining the data complies with U.S.
Laws and, where applicable, with End User License Agreement, Copyright Laws, Terms 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 42 of 88
of Service, and laws and policies regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Offerors
shall also address IP restrictions on the use or transfer of such data sets, in Attachment 2
of the Offeror’s proposal, as described in Section 4.B.1.d.
Offerors shall also include the documentation required in 6.B. (Human Use).
Documentation must be well written and logical; claims for exemptions from Federal
regulations for human subject protection must be accompanied by a strong defense of the
claims. The Human Use documentation and the written verification are not included in the
total page count.
E. Deliverables. Based on the required deliverablesidentified in Section 1 of the BAA, clearly
identify the hardware and data to be delivered, including technical data and computer
software. In Attachment 2 to Offeror’s proposal, Offerors shall address IP rights in such
data, as described in Section 4.B.1.d.
F. Cost, schedule, milestones. Describe the cost, schedule, and milestones for the proposed
research, including cost estimates by cost element for base period, the option period(s) and
the total program summary, and company cost share, if any, as well as, costs by technical
area(s) and tasks (see tables below for sample format). The milestones shall not include
proprietary information (Offeror can use their own format for milestones).
(Note: The full Volume 2 - Cost Proposal is not required unless requested by the CO;
therefore, it is critical that Offerors address this element in their technical proposal
so the Government can evaluate funding availability. See BAA Sections 4.B.2, 5.A.,
and 5.B).

J. Resource Share. Include the type of support, if any, the Offeror might request from the
Government, such as facilities, equipment, materials, or any such resources the Offeror is
willing to provide at no additional cost to the Government to support the research effort.
Cost sharing is not required from Offerors and is not an evaluation criterion but is
encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application
related to the proposed research and development effort.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 44 of 88
K. The names of other federal, state, or local agencies or other parties receiving the proposal
and/or funding the proposed effort. If none, so state. Concurrent submission of the proposal
to other organizations will not prejudice its review but may impact IARPA’s decision to
fund the effort. See 5.A.2.a.
L. Research Data Management Plan. (RDMP). Submit a RDMP that outlines how they will
manage and preserve the Research Data, as defined below, collected, or produced through
the course of performance. The RDMP need not require the preservation of all Research
Data: Offerors shall consider the cost and benefits of managing and preserving the
Research Data in determining whether to preserve it. At a minimum, all Research Data
associated with a peer-reviewed manuscript or final published article (hereinafter
“Publications”) must be made publicly accessible by the award recipient before, on or at a
reasonable time after the publication date. The Publications whose associated data must be
covered by the RDMP are deliverables as described in Section 1.
Research Data is defined herein as the digital recorded factual material commonly accepted
in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings including data sets
used to support scholarly publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks,
preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review
reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory
specimens.
The RDMP must address the following:
• Describe the types of Research Data collected or produced in the course of the project.
Include standards to be used for Research Data and metadata content and format.
• A plan for making the Research Data that underlie Publications digitally accessible to
the public before or, at the time of publication or conference presentation, or within a
reasonable time after publication. The requirement could be met by including the data
as supplementary information to the Publication or by depositing the Research Data in
a searchable, machine-readable, and digitally accessible form suitable for repositories
available to the public free of charge. Such repositories could be discipline-specific
repositories, general purpose research data repositories or institutional repositories. The
published article or conference paper should indicate how the public may access
Research Data underlying the paper’s results and findings. Offerors should attempt to
make the Research Data available for at least three years after published article or
conference. (NOTE: Offerors shall make a best effort in identifying research data sets
that may be used for Publications that occur after contract end. The Offeror shall deliver
these data sets to the Government and make them available in repositories available to
the public prior to the end of the period of performance, if not included as
supplementary information to Publications.)
• Policies and provisions for sharing and preservation, including a) policies and
provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, and IP, b)
descriptions of tools, including software, needed to access and interpret the Research
Data, and c) policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and production of
derivatives.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 45 of 88
• If, for legitimate reasons (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, security, IP rights
considerations; size of data sets, cost; time), the Research Data underlying the results
of peer-reviewed publications or conference papers cannot be shared and preserved,
the plan must include a justification citing such reasons.
In addressing these elements (e.g., types of data to be shared and preserved, standards to
be used for data and metadata, repositories to be used for archiving data, timeframes for
sharing and preservation), the RDMP should reflect the best practices of the relevant
scientific discipline and research community. At a minimum, Research Data underlying
Publications and associated metadata shall include an acknowledgement of IARPA support
and a link to the associated Publication.
4.B.1.d. Section 4: Attachments
[NOTE: The attachments listed below shall be included with the proposal, if applicable, but do
not count against the Volume 1-page limit.]
Attachment 1: Signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter(s) (if applicable). A
template is provided in Appendix A.
Attachment 2: IP Rights. A template is provided in Appendix A. This attachment is estimated not
to exceed 4 pages and shall address the following:
Representation as to Rights. An Offeror shall provide a good faith representation that they
either own or have sufficient licensing rights to all IP that will be utilized under their
proposal.
Program-Specific IP Approach. IARPA requires sufficient rights to IP developed or used in
the conduct of the proposed research to ensure that IARPA can successfully (a) manage the
program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, (b) communicate program
information across Government organizations, and (c) support transition to and further use
and development of the program results by Intelligence community (IC) users and others.
IARPA anticipates that achieving these goals for the ReSCIND program will necessitate a
minimum of Unlimited Rights in all deliverables. However, there may be any number of
other approaches to intellectual property rights to achieve IARPA’s program goals.
“Unlimited rights” means the rights of the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare
derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly,
in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others to do so. In addressing their
approach to IP rights, Offerors should (1) describe the intended use of patented invention(s)
or data, including, technical data and computer software, in the conduct of the proposed
research; (2) describe the rights being offered to the Government along with a justification
if less than Unlimited Rights is being offered; (3) explain how IARPA will be able to reach
its program goals (including transition) with the rights offered to the Government; (4)
identify the cost to the Government to acquire additional or alternative rights beyond those
being offered, if applicable; and (5) provide possible alternatives in any area in which the
offered rights may be insufficient for IARPA to achieve its program goals (e.g., the
possibility of future licensing of privately-developed software to U.S. Government agencies
at a reasonable cost.)
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 46 of 88
Patented Inventions. Offerors shall include documentation using the format provided
in Appendix A, proving ownership of or sufficient rights to all inventions (or inventions
for which a patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under the proposal for the
IARPA program. If a patent application has been filed for an invention that the proposal
utilizes, but the application has not yet been made publicly available and contains
proprietary information, the Offeror may provide only the serial number, inventor name(s),
assignee names (if any), filing date, filing date of any related provisional application, and a
summary of the patent title, together with either: (1) a representation that the Offeror owns
the invention, or (2) proof of sufficient licensing rights in the invention. Offerors shall also
indicate their intention to incorporate patented technology into any deliverable- i.e., if
Offerors intend for any deliverable to embody any invention covered by any patent or patent
application the Offerors listed in Volume 1, Attachment 2, Offerors should also specify in
the Attachment the deliverable into which the Offerors expects to incorporate the invention.
In doing so, the Government requests that Offerors further specify any rights offered to the
Government for inventions that shall be utilized in the program (beyond the implied license
that accompanies a patent owner’s sale of a patented product).
Noncommercial Data. Offerors shall identify all noncommercial data, including technical
data and computer software, that it plans to generate, develop and/or deliver under any
proposed award instrument in which the Government shall acquire less than unlimited
rights. In doing so, Offerors must assert (a) the specific restrictions the Government’s rights
in those deliverables, (b) the basis for such restrictions, (c) the intended use of the technical
data and noncommercial computer software in the conduct of the proposed research and
development of applicable deliverables, and (d) a supporting rationale of why the proposed
approach to data rights is in the Government’s best interest (please see program specific
goals above). If no restrictions are intended, then the Offeror shall state “NONE.”
Commercial Data. Offerors shall identify all commercial data, including technical data and
commercial computer software, that may be included in any deliverables contemplated
under the research effort and assert any applicable restrictions on the Government’s use of
such commercial data (please see program specific goals above). If no restrictions are
intended, then the Proposer shall state “NONE.”
Data Developed with Mixed Funding. If mixed funding is anticipated in data generated,
developed, and/or delivered under the research effort, the Government seeks at minimum
“Government Purpose Rights” (GPR) for all noncommercial data deliverables; offering
anything less shall be considered a weakness in the proposal. United States Government
purposes include any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including
cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales
or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international
organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include
the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or
computer software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so. Government
Purpose Rights continue for a five-year period upon execution of the contract, and upon
expiration of the five-year period, the Government obtains Unlimited Rights in the data.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 47 of 88
Open Source. If Offerors propose the use of any open-source data or freeware, any
conditions, restrictions, or other requirements imposed by that software shall also be
addressed. Offerors should leverage the format in Appendix A for their response.
Identification of Relevant Government Contracts. For all technical data and computer
software that an Offeror intends to deliver with other than unlimited rights that are identical
or substantially similar to technical data and computer software that the Offeror has
produced for, delivered to, or is obligated to deliver to the Government under any contract
or subcontract, the Offeror shall identify (a) the contract number under which the data,
software, or documentation was produced; (b) the contract number under which, and the
name and address of the organization to whom, the data and software was most recently
delivered or shall be delivered; and (c) any limitations on the Government’s rights to use or
disclose the data and software, including, when applicable, identification of the earliest date
the limitations expire.
Definitions. For this solicitation, the Government recognizes only the definitions of IP rights
in accordance with the terms as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part
27, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) part 227, or as defined
herein. If Offerors propose IP rights that are not defined in FAR part 27, DFARS part 227,
or herein, Offerors shall clearly define such rights in the “Intellectual Property Rights”
Attachment of their proposal. Offerors are reminded of the requirement for prime
contractors to acquire sufficient rights from subcontractors to accomplish the program goals.
Evaluation. The Government may use the asserted data rights during the evaluation process
to evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions. The technical content of the
“Intellectual Property Rights” Attachment shall include only the information necessary to
address the proposed approach to IP; any other technical discussion in the attachment shall
not be considered during the evaluation process.
Attachment 3: OCI Notification or Certification Template provided in Appendix A.
Attachment 4: Bibliography. A brief bibliography of relevant technical papers and research notes
(published and unpublished) which document the technical ideas on which the proposal is based.
Attachment 5: Relevant Papers. Copies of not more than three relevant papers may be included
in the submission. The Offerors shall include a one-page technical summary of each paper
provided, suitable for individuals who are not experts in the field.
Attachment 6: Consultant Commitment Letters. If needed.
Attachment 7: Human Use Documentation, reference section 6.B.9.
Attachment 8: Animal Use Documentation. Not applicable
Attachment 9: A Three Chart Summary of the Proposal. A PowerPoint summary that quickly and
succinctly indicates the concept overview, key innovations, expected impact, and other unique
aspects of the proposal. The format for the summary slides is included in Appendix A to this BAA
and does not count against the page limit. Slide 1 should be a self-contained, intuitive description
of the technical approach and performance. These slides may be used during the evaluation process
to present a summary of the proposal from the Offeror’s view.
Attachment 10: Security Plan. Not applicable
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 48 of 88
Attachment 11: RDMP (estimated as 2 to 3 pages). Template provided in Appendix A.
Attachment 12: Privacy Plan, (4-page limit). As part of their proposal, Offeror’s shall prepare a
ReSCIND Privacy Plan v1.0 that comprehensively describes the efforts the Offeror will take to
protect personally identifiable information and safeguard the security of any personal data collected
and that of any devices, applications, networks, or services involved in collection, transmission,
processing, and storage of such data. Any claims that data are anonymous must be based on
evidence and supported with sufficient information regarding how the data have been anonymized.
The initial version of the ReSCIND Privacy Plan shall be included in the Offeror’s proposal as a
standalone appendix. The ReSCIND Privacy Plan shall be updated at the beginning of each Phase
and whenever new sources of data or datasets are proposed for use within a Performer’s ReSCIND
research activities, to include data used for either development or evaluation purposes.
Attachment 13: Experimental Protocol: The sections listed in Appendix A.7 are mandatory. The
Offeror can add other sections as appropriate (maximum 18 pages, not including standard
questionnaires and inventories). If the information is included in a different section of the proposal
or another attachment, then the Offerorshall summarize and state: “See Section X.X of Technical
## 4.B.2. Volume 2: Cost Proposal (No Page Limit)

**NOTE:** This Volume is only required if the Offeror’s proposal has been selected for negotiation (see BAA Section 5.B and 5.C). The notification of selection for negotiation will be issued in writing by the Contracting Officer and will include a request to submit the full Cost Volume within 10 business days or as otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

The Government anticipates awarding cost-type procurement contracts. However, Offerors requesting anything other than a cost-type procurement contract (i.e., Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract) may be directed by the Contracting Officer to provide “other than certified cost or pricing data” (reference FAR Part 15.4) and/or cost supporting information in a different format than described below. The Contracting Officer will determine whether to grant the request for other than a cost-type procurement contract. Examples of requests that would be considered for approval include those from non-traditional contractors such as commercial entities that do not accept FAR-based cost contracts, small businesses, start-up companies, consortia that may include universities and non-profits or foreign companies; where cost-sharing or government participation in the work is appropriate; where flexibility not available under a procurement contract is needed; or where commercialization by industry is deemed advantageous to the Government.

Regardless of the type of instrument determined to be appropriate by the CO, the Offeror’s cost proposal shall contain sufficient information to establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project, the perception of project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to support the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost, to the extent appropriate. The Government recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may motivate Offerors to offer low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel to be in a more competitive posture. The Government discourages such cost strategies. Cost reduction approaches that shall be received favorably include innovative management concepts that maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.

### 4.B.2.a Section 1: Cover Sheet

See Appendix B for the Cover Sheet Template.

### 4.B.2.b. Section 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown

Offerors shall submit numerical cost and pricing data using Microsoft Excel. The Excel document, in the format provided in Appendix B, shall include intact formulas and shall not be hard numbered. The base and option period cost data should roll up into a total cost summary. The Excel files may be write-protected but shall not be password protected. The Cost/Price Volume shall include the following:

- **A. Completed Cost/Price Template**: Offerors shall submit a cost element breakdown for the base period, each option period and the total program summary in the format provided in Appendix B.
- **B. Total cost broken down by major task.**
- **C. Major program tasks by fiscal year.**
- **D. A summary of projected funding requirements by month.**
- **E. A summary table listing all labor categories used in the proposal and their associated direct labor rates, along with escalation factors used for each base year and option year.**
- **F. A summary table listing all indirect rates used in the proposal for each base year and option year.**

### 4.B.2.c. Section 3: Supporting Information

In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient detail to substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the basis of estimate (BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable:

- **Direct Labor**: Provide a complete cost breakout by labor category, hours, and rates (template available in Appendix B). Specify all Key Personnel by name and clearly state their labor category and proposed rate. Describe the basis of the proposed rates and provide a copy of the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) with the Government. If Offerors do not have a current FPRA with the Government, provide payroll records or contingency hire letters with salary data to support each proposed labor category, including those for key individuals, and the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal Submission, if applicable. Offeror should also address whether any portion of their labor rates is attributable to uncompensated overtime.
- **Labor Escalation Factor**: State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g., based upon Global Insight indices, Cost Index, or historical data). If the escalation rate is based upon historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample calculation demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor.
- **Subcontracts (to include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs))**: The Offeror is responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume. Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, each option period and the total summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Appendix B). Consultant letter(s) of commitment shall also be attached. Information shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided in Appendix B and addressing the supporting cost information as outlined in Section 4 of the BAA. In addition to the full and complete subcontractor cost proposals, the Offeror shall also provide its analysis of each subcontractor’s proposal including justification for why the subcontractor was selected and its determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable (Reference FAR Part 44 and FAR clause 52.244-2). If subcontractors have concerns about proprietary cost information, subcontractors may submit their detailed cost proposals directly to the CO.
- **Materials and Equipment**: Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data or any other information including Offeror’s analysis to support proposed costs.
- **Travel**: The proposed travel supporting detail shall include destination and purpose of the trip, number of trips, number of travelers and days per trip and price per traveler in sufficient detail to verify the BOE. Proposed travel costs shall comply with the limitations set forth in FAR Part 31. (See Appendix B.4 for sample format). Proposed conference travel must have an immediate, direct, and tangible benefit to the Government such as providing a deliverable at the conference (e.g., gives a presentation, presents a paper or research findings that are sponsored in whole or in part by IARPA). Travel for personnel to simply attend a conference will not be approved as a direct charge to the contract.
- **Other Direct Costs (ODCs)**: ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes, historical data or any other information including the Offeror’s analysis.
- **Indirect Costs**: The Offeror shall show indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect rate by contractor fiscal year and program period (base, option period) and provide information on indirect cost pools and allocation bases for each year and program period involved. If a Government agency recently audited the Offeror’s indirect rates, the Offeror shall identify the agency that conducted the audit, when the rates were approved and the period for which they are effective. Include a copy of this rate agreement. Absent current Government rate recommendations, it is incumbent on the Offeror to provide some other means of demonstrating indirect rate realism (e.g., 3 years of historical actual costs with applicable pools and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly from historical experience, the Offeror shall explain the variance.
- **Cost sharing**: Describe the source, nature, and amount of cost-sharing, if any. Reference Resource Share from Section 4 of the BAA.
- **Other Pricing Assumptions**: Identify all pricing assumptions, that should be incorporated into the resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished Property/Facilities/Information, access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.). Reference Resource Share from Section 4 of the BAA.
- **Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM)**: If proposing FCCM, the Offeror shall show FCCM cost calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and program year and provide a copy of the Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA), Forward Price Rate System (FPRS) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR), if available.
- **Profit/Fee**: Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base. Provide justification for your proposed profit or fee.
- **Systems**: For the systems listed below, provide a brief description of the cognizant federal agency and audit results. If the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short narrative describing the steps your organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the current status. If a formal audit has been performed by a Government Agency, please provide a complete copy of the audit report or adequacy determination letter. If the system has never received a formal Government review and approval include a statement to that effect. Address whether your organization has contracts that are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered and if so, whether they are subject to full or modified CAS coverage.

  - Accounting system
  - Purchasing system

Certified “cost or pricing data” may be requested for procurement contract awards that exceed the threshold for submittal as set forth in the FAR, unless the Contracting Officer approves an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. (Reference FAR Part 15.403.)

## 4.C. Submission Details

### 4.C.1. Due Dates

See BAA General Information Section for proposal due dates and times.

### 4.C.2. Proposal Delivery

Proposals (Volume 1 initially) shall be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS). Offerors interested in providing a submission in response to this BAA shall first register by electronic means in accordance with the instructions provided on the following web site: [https://iarpa-ideas.gov](https://iarpa-ideas.gov). Offerors who plan to submit proposals for evaluation are strongly encouraged to register at least one week prior to the due date for the first round of proposals. Offerors who do not register in advance do so at their own risk, and IARPA shall not extend the due date to accommodate such Offerors. Failure to register as stated shall prevent the Proposer’s submittal of documents.

After registration has been approved, Offeror’s should upload a proposal, (initially Volume 1 only), scanned certifications and permitted additional information in ‘pdf’ format, or as otherwise directed (Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Offerors are responsible for ensuring a compliant and timely submission of their proposals to meet the BAA submittal deadlines. Time management to upload and submit is wholly the responsibility of the Offeror. **Note:** IDEAS will require Offerors to complete a proposal cover sheet within IDEAS at the time that the Volume 1 – Technical and Management Proposal is submitted. This is separate and distinct from the Technical and Cost Volume cover sheets referenced in 4.B.1.a. and 4.B.2.a. and provided in Appendices A and B, respectively. Information requested within IDEAS will include basic cost information (Total funds requested from IARPA, proposed costs by option period and validity period). Please complete the requested information, but **DO NOT** upload your Volume 2 – Cost Proposal. Directions for submittal of Volume 2 – Cost Proposal will be provided by the CO when Offerors are notified of selection for negotiations.

Upon completing the proposal submission, the Offeror shall receive an automated confirmation email from IDEAS. Please forward that automated message to [dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov](mailto:dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov). IARPA strongly suggests that the Offeror document the submission of their proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and date stamped) that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a proposal to the IDEAS website.

Volume 1 submitted by any means other than IDEAS (e.g., hand-carried, postal service, commercial carrier and email) shall not be considered unless the Offeror attempted electronic submittal but was unsuccessful. Should an Offeror be unable to complete the electronic submittal, the Offeror shall employ the following procedure. The Offeror shall send an e-mail to [dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov](mailto:dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov), prior to the proposal due date and time specified in the BAA and indicate that an attempt was made to submit electronically and that the submittal was unsuccessful. This e-mail shall include contact information for the Offeror. Upon receipt of such notification, the Government will provide additional guidance regarding submission.

Volume 1 shall be submitted by the date and time specified in the BAA, Overview section, Proposal Due Date for Initial Round of Selections, in order to be considered in the initial round. It is in IARPA’s sole discretion whether to evaluate proposals received after this due date set forth in the Overview Section. Selection remains contingent on the technical and funding availability evaluation factors. Proposals received after the due date are deemed to be late and will not be reviewed. Failure to comply with the submission procedures may result in the submittal not being evaluated.

Although classified proposals are not anticipated for this program, if an offeror chooses to submit a classified proposal, the offeror must first contact IARPA via [dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov](mailto:dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov) for detailed submittal instructions. In no case shall classified information be uploaded into IDEAS.

Classified proposals are not anticipated for this program. In no case shall classified information be uploaded into IDEAS.

## 4.D. Funding Restrictions

Facility construction costs are not allowable under this activity. Funding may not be used to pay for commercialization of technology.

## 5. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION:

### 5.A. Technical and Funding Availability Evaluation Factors

The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this Program BAA are described in the following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be evaluated on its own merits and its relevance to the Program goals rather than against other proposals submitted in response to this BAA. The proposals shall be evaluated based on technical and funding availability factors. These are of equal importance. Within the technical evaluation factor, the specific technical criteria are in descending order of importance, as follows: Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan, Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal, Relevant Experience and Expertise, and Resource Realism. Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided below.

Award(s) shall be made to an Offeror based on the technical and funding availability factors listed below, and subject to successful negotiations with the Government. Award shall not be made to Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) are determined not to be selectable. Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.

#### 5.A.1. Technical Evaluation Factor (technical criteria listed below)

- **5.A.1.a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**: Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal is substantiated, including unique and innovative methods, approaches, and/or concepts. The Offeror clearly articulates an understanding of the problem to be solved. The technical approach is credible and includes a clear assessment of primary risks and a means to address them. The proposed research advances the state-of-the-art.
- **5.A.1.b. Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan**: The feasibility and likelihood that the proposed approach will satisfy the Program’s milestones and metrics are explicitly described and clearly substantiated along with risk mitigation strategies for achieving stated milestones and metrics. The proposal reflects a mature and quantitative understanding of the program milestones and metrics, and the statistical confidence with which they may be measured. Any Offeror proposed milestones and metrics are clear and well-defined, with a logical connection to enabling Offeror decisions and/or Government decisions. The schedule to achieve the milestones is realistic and reasonable. The roles and relationships of prime and sub-contractors are clearly delineated with all participants fully documented. Work plans shall demonstrate the ability to provide full Government visibility into and interaction with key technical activities and personnel, and a single point of responsibility for contract performance. Work plans shall also demonstrate that all Key Personnel and significant contributors have sufficient time committed to the Program to accomplish their described Program roles. The requirement and rationale for and the anticipated use or integration of Government resources, including but not limited to all equipment, facilities, information, etc., are fully described including dates when such Government Furnished Property (GFP), GFE, GFC, GFI or other similar Government-provided resources shall be required. The Offeror’s RDMP is complete, addressing the types of data to be collected or produced, describing how each type of data will be preserved and shared, including plans to provide public access to peer reviewed publications and the underlying Research Data, or provides justifiable rationale for not making this data available.
- **5.A.1.c. Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal**: The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated program goals and all elements within the proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The Offeror clearly addresses how the proposed effort shall meet and progressively demonstrate the Program goals. The Offeror describes how the proposed solution contributes to IARPA’s mission to invest in high-risk/high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with an overwhelming intelligence advantage. The Offeror’s proposed IP and data rights are consistent with the Government’s need to be able to effectively manage the program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, communicate program information across Government organizations and support transition to and further use and development of the program results by IC users and others at a reasonable cost that is acceptable to the Government. The proposed approach to IP rights is in the Government’s best interest.
- **5.A.1.d Relevant Experience and Expertise**: The Offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal's objectives, shall be evaluated, as well as qualifications, capabilities, and experience of all Key Personnel and significant contributors critical in achieving the program objectives.
- **5.A.1.e Resource Realism**: The proposed resources demonstrate a clear understanding of the program, a perception of the risks and the Offeror’s ability to organize and perform the work. The labor hours and mix are consistent with the technical approach and are realistic for the work proposed. Material, equipment, software, data collection and management, and travel, especially foreign travel, are well justified, reasonable, and required for successful execution of the proposed work.

#### 5.A.2. Funding Availability Factor

- **5.A.2.a. Budget Constraints**: The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting program objectives within program budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts. **Note:** If the Offeror has submitted the proposal to other federal, state, or local agencies or other parties that may fund the proposed effort, it may impact the Government’s decision to fund the effort.
Proposal” or “See page 2 of Privacy Plan”.
4.B.2. Volume 2: Cost Proposal (No Page Limit)
NOTE: This Volume is only required if the Offeror’s proposal has been selected for
negotiation (see BAA Section 5.B and 5.C). The notification of selection for negotiation will
be issued in writing by the Contracting Officer and will include a request to submit the full
Cost Volume within 10 business days or as otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.
The Government anticipates awarding cost-type procurement contracts however, Offerors
requesting anything other than a cost-type procurement contract (i.e., Firm Fixed Price (FFP)
contract) may be directed by the Contracting Officer to provide “other than certified cost or pricing
data” (reference FAR Part 15.4) and/or cost supporting information in a different format than
described below. The Contracting Officer will determine whether to grant the request for other than
a cost-type procurement contract. Examples of requests that would be considered for approval
include those from non-traditional contractors such as commercial entities that do not accept FARbased cost contracts, small businesses, start-up companies, consortia that may include universities
and non-profits or foreign companies; where cost-sharing or government participation in the work
is appropriate; where flexibility not available under a procurement contract is needed; or where
commercialization by industry is deemed advantageous to the Government.
Regardless of the type of instrument determined to be appropriate by the CO, the Offeror’s cost
proposalshall contain sufficientinformation to establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project,
the perception of project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to support the
realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost, to the extent appropriate. The Government
recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may motivate Offerors to offer low-risk ideas with
minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel to be in a more competitive
posture. The Government discourages such cost strategies. Cost reduction approaches that shall
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 49 of 88
be received favorably include innovative management conceptsthat maximize direct funding for
technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.
4.B.2.a Section 1: Cover Sheet.
See Appendix B for the Cover Sheet Template
4.B.2.b. Section 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown.
Offerorsshall submit numerical cost and pricing data using Microsoft Excel. The Excel document,
in the format provided in Appendix B, shall include intact formulas and shall not be hard
numbered. The base and option period cost data should roll up into a total cost summary. The
Excel files may be write-protected but shall not be password protected. The Cost/Price Volume
shall include the following:
A. Completed Cost/Price Template - Offerors shall submit a cost element breakdown for
the base period, each option period and the total program summary in the format
provided in Appendix B.
B. Total cost broken down by major task.
C. Major program tasks by fiscal year.
D. A summary of projected funding requirements by month.
E. A summary table listing all labor categories used in the proposal and their associated
direct labor rates, along with escalation factors used for each base year and option year.
F. A summary table listing all indirect rates used in the proposal for each base year and
option year.
4.B.2.c. Section 3: Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient
detail to substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the basis of estimate
(BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable:
Direct Labor – Provide a complete cost breakout by labor category, hours, and rates (template
available in Appendix B). Specify all Key Personnel by name and clearly state their labor
category and proposed rate. Describe the basis of the proposed rates and provide a copy of the
most recent Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) with the Government.If Offerors do not
have a current FPRA with the Government, provide payroll records or contingency hire letters
with salary data to support each proposed labor category, including those for key individuals,
and the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal Submission, if applicable. Offeror should
also address whether any portion of their labor ratesis attributable to uncompensated overtime.
Labor Escalation Factor – State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g.,
based upon Global Insight indices,Cost Index, or historical data).If the escalation rate is based
upon historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample
calculation demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 50 of 88
Subcontracts (to include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs) – The Offeror
is responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume.
Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, each option period
and the total summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Appendix
B). Consultant letter(s) of commitment shall also be attached.
Information shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided in
Appendix B and addressing the supporting cost information as outlined in Section 4 of the
BAA. In addition to the full and complete subcontractor cost proposals, the Offerorshall also
provide its analysis of each subcontractor’s proposal including justification for why the
subcontractor was selected and its determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable
(Reference FAR Part 44 and FAR clause 52.244-2). If subcontractors have concerns about
proprietary cost information, subcontractors may submit their detailed cost proposals
directly to the CO.
Materials and Equipment – Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data or any
other information including Offeror’s analysis to support proposed costs.
Travel - The proposed travelsupporting detailshall include destination and purpose of the trip,
number of trips, number of travelers and days per trip and price per traveler in sufficient detail
to verify the BOE. Proposed travel costs shall comply with the limitations set forth in FAR
Part 31. (See Appendix B.4 for sample format).
Proposed conference travel must have an immediate, direct, and tangible benefit to the
Government such as providing a deliverable at the conference (e.g., gives a presentation,
presents a paper or research findingsthat are sponsored in whole or in part by IARPA). Travel
for personnel to simply attend a conference will not be approved as a direct charge to the
contract.
Other Direct Costs (ODCs) – ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes,
historical data or any other information including the Offeror’s analysis.
Indirect Costs – The Offeror shallshow indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect
rate by contractor fiscal year and program period (base, option period) and provide information
on indirect cost pools and allocation bases for each year and program period involved. If a
Government agency recently audited the Offeror’sindirect rates, the Offeror shall identify the
agency that conducted the audit, when the rates were approved and the period for which they
are effective. Include a copy of this rate agreement. Absent current Government rate
recommendations, it is incumbent on the Offeror to provide some other means of
demonstrating indirect rate realism(e.g., 3 years of historical actual costs with applicable pools
and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly from historical experience, the Offeror shall
explain the variance.
Cost sharing – Describe the source, nature, and amount of cost-sharing, if any. Reference
Resource Share from Section 4 of the BAA.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 51 of 88
Other Pricing Assumptions – Identify all pricing assumptions, that should be incorporated into
the resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished
Property/Facilities/Information, access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.).
Reference Resource Share from Section 4 of the BAA.
Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM) – If proposing FCCM, the Offeror shall show
FCCM cost calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and
program year and provide a copy of the Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA), Forward Price
Rate System (FPRS) or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR), if available.
Profit/Fee - Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base.
Provide justification for your proposed profit or fee.

agency and audit results. If the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short
narrative describing the steps your organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the
currentstatus.If a formal audit has been performed by a Government Agency, please provide
a complete copy of the audit report or adequacy determination letter. If the system has never
received a formal Government review and approval include a statement to that effect. Address
whether your organization has contracts that are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered
and if so, whether they are subject to full or modified CAS coverage.
• Accounting system
• Purchasing system
Certified “cost or pricing data” may be requested for procurement contract awards that exceed the
threshold for submittal as set forth in the FAR, unless the Contracting Officer approves an
exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. (Reference FAR Part 15.403.)
4.C. Submission Details
4.C.1. Due Dates
See BAA General Information Section for proposal due dates and times.
4.C.2. Proposal Delivery
Proposals (Volume 1 initially) shall be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution
and Evaluation System (IDEAS). Offerors interested in providing a submission in response to
this BAA shall first register by electronic means in accordance with the instructions provided on
the following web site: https://iarpa-ideas.gov. Offerors who plan to submit proposals for
evaluation are strongly encouraged to register at least one week prior to the due date for the first
round of proposals. Offerors who do not register in advance do so at their own risk, and IARPA
shall not extend the due date to accommodate such Offerors. Failure to register as stated shall
prevent the Proposer’s submittal of documents.
After registration has been approved, Offeror’s should upload a proposal, (initially Volume 1
only), scanned certifications and permitted additional information in ‘pdf’ format, or as
otherwise directed (Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Offerors are responsible for ensuring a compliant
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 52 of 88
and timely submission of their proposals to meet the BAA submittal deadlines. Time management
to upload and submit is wholly the responsibility of the Offeror. Note: IDEAS will require
Offerors to complete a proposal cover sheet within IDEAS at the time that the Volume 1 –
Technical and Management Proposal is submitted. This is separate and distinct from the
Technical and Cost Volume cover sheets referenced in 4.B.1.a. and 4.B.2.a. and provided in
Appendices A and B, respectively. Information requested within IDEAS will include basic
cost information (Total funds requested from IARPA, proposed costs by option period and
validity period). Please complete the requested information, but DO NOT upload your
Volume 2 – Cost Proposal. Directions for submittal of Volume 2 – Cost Proposal will be
provided by the CO when Offerors are notified of selection for negotiations.
Upon completing the proposal submission, the Offeror shall receive an automated confirmation
email from IDEAS. Please forward that automated message to dni-iarpa-rescindBAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov. IARPA strongly suggests that the Offeror document the
submission of their proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and date stamped)
that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a proposal to the IDEAS
website.
Volume 1 submitted by any means other than IDEAS (e.g., hand-carried, postal service,
commercial carrier and email) shall not be considered unless the Offeror attempted electronic
submittal but was unsuccessful. Should an Offeror be unable to complete the electronic submittal,
the Offeror shall employ the following procedure. The Offeror shall send an e-mail to dni-iarparescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov, prior to the proposal due date and time specified in the
BAA and indicate that an attempt was made to submit electronically and that the submittal was
unsuccessful. This e-mail shall include contact information for the Offeror. Upon receipt of such
notification, the Government will provide additional guidance regarding submission.
Volume 1 shall be submitted by the date and time specified in the BAA, Overview section,
Proposal Due Date for Initial Round of Selections, in order to be considered in the initial round.
It is in IARPA’s sole discretion whether to evaluate proposals received after this due date set forth
in the Overview Section. Selection remains contingent on the technical and funding availability
evaluation factors. Proposals received after the due date are deemed to be late and will not be reviewed.
Failure to comply with the submission procedures may result in the submittal not being evaluated.
Although classified proposals are not anticipated for this program, if an offeror chooses to submit
a classified proposal, the offeror must first contact IARPA via dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission2023@iarpa.gov for detailed submittal instructions. In no case shall classified information be

5. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION:
5.A. Technical and Funding Availability Evaluation Factors
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this Program BAA are
described in the following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be
evaluated on its own merits and its relevance to the Program goals rather than against other
proposals submitted in response to this BAA. The proposals shall be evaluated based on technical
and funding availability factors. These are of equal importance. Within the technical evaluation
factor, the specific technical criteria are in descending order of importance, as follows: Overall
Scientific and Technical Merit, Effectiveness of ProposedWork Plan, Contribution and Relevance
to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal, Relevant Experience and Expertise, and Resource
Realism. Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided below.
Award(s) shall be made to an Offeror based on the technical and funding availability factors listed
below, and subject to successful negotiations with the Government. Award shall not be made to
Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) are determined not to be selectable. Offerors are cautioned that
failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their proposal evaluation or may result
in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
5.A.1. Technical Evaluation Factor (technical criteria listed below)
5.A.1.a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal is substantiated, including unique and
innovative methods, approaches, and/or concepts. The Offeror clearly articulates an understanding
of the problem to be solved. The technical approach is credible and includes a clear assessment of
primary risks and a means to address them. The proposed research advances the state-of-the-art.
5.A.1.b. Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan
The feasibility and likelihood that the proposed approach will satisfy the Program’s milestones and
metrics are explicitly described and clearly substantiated along with risk mitigation strategies for
achieving stated milestones and metrics. The proposal reflects a mature and quantitative
understanding of the program milestones and metrics, and the statistical confidence with which they
may be measured. Any Offeror proposed milestones and metrics are clear and well-defined, with a
logical connection to enabling Offeror decisions and/or Government decisions. The schedule to
achieve the milestones is realistic and reasonable.
The roles and relationships of prime and sub-contractors are clearly delineated with all participants
fully documented. Work plans shall demonstrate the ability to provide full Government visibility
into and interaction with key technical activities and personnel, and a single point of responsibility
for contract performance. Work plans shall also demonstrate that all Key Personnel and significant 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 54 of 88
contributors have sufficient time committed to the Program to accomplish their described Program
roles.
The requirement and rationale for and the anticipated use or integration of Government resources,
including but not limited to all equipment, facilities, information, etc., are fully described including
dates when such Government Furnished Property (GFP), GFE, GFC, GFI or other similar
Government-provided resources shall be required.
The Offeror’s RDMP is complete, addressing the types of data to be collected or produced,
describing how each type of data will be preserved and shared, including plans to provide public
access to peer reviewed publications and the underlying Research Data, or provides justifiable
rationale for not making this data available.
5.A.1.c. Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal
The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated program goals and all elements within
the proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The Offeror clearly addresses
how the proposed effort shall meet and progressively demonstrate the Program goals. The Offeror
describes how the proposed solution contributes to IARPA’s mission to invest in high-risk/highpayoff research that can provide the U.S. with an overwhelming intelligence advantage.
The Offeror’s proposed IP and data rights are consistent with the Government’s need to be able to
effectively manage the program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, communicate
program information across Government organizations and support transition to and further use and
development of the program results by IC users and others at a reasonable cost that is acceptable to
the Government. The proposed approach to IP rights is in the Government’s best interest.
5.A.1.d Relevant Experience and Expertise
The Offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of
these, which are integral factorsfor achieving the proposal's objectives,shall be evaluated, as well
as qualifications, capabilities, and experience of all Key Personnel and significant contributors
critical in achieving the program objectives.
5.A.1.e Resource Realism
The proposed resources demonstrate a clear understanding of the program,a perception of the risks
and the Offeror’s ability to organize and perform the work. The labor hours and mix are consistent
with the technical approach and are realistic for the work proposed. Material, equipment,software,
data collection and management, and travel, especially foreign travel, are well justified,
reasonable, and required for successful execution of the proposed work.
5.A.2. Funding Availability Factor
5.A.2.a. Budget Constraints
The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting program objectives within
program budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts. Note: If the Offeror
has submitted the proposal to other federal, state, or local agencies or other parties that may fund
the proposed effort, it may impact the Government’s decision to fund the effort.
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 55 of 88
5.A.2.b. Program Balance
The Government will consider IARPA’s overall mission and program objectives, which may
include but are not limited to the following: broadening the variety of technical approaches to
enhance program outcomes, transitioning the technology to Government partners, developing
capabilities aligned with the priorities of the IC and national security.
5.B. Method of Evaluation and Selection Process
The Government will conduct an impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal reviews and selects
the source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government's technical, policy and programmatic
goals. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in Section 4 of the BAA.
Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal shall not be considered.
The contract award process for this BAA has two steps. The first step is selection for negotiations
and is made based on review of the technical and funding availability factors (See BAA Section
5.A.). The second step is negotiation and contract award. Contract award is contingent on
Contracting Officer determination of a fair and reasonable cost/price and agreement on terms and
conditions.
Selection for negotiation, will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process led by the
PM. This process entails establishing a Scientific Review Panel (SRP) made up of qualified
Government personnel who will review and assess each proposal’s strengths, weaknesses, and
risks against the technical evaluation criteria. If necessary, non-Government technical experts with
specialized expertise may advise Government panel members and the PM. However, only
Government personnel will make selection determinations under this BAA.
Proposals will be reviewed individually and will not be reviewed against each other as they are
not submitted in accordance with a common SOW. When SRP reviews are complete, the PM will
prepare a recommendation to the IARPA Scientific Review Official (SRO) identifying proposals
as selectable, selectable with modification, or not selectable based on consideration of all stated
factors (technical and funding availability factors). The SRO will make the final decision as to
selectability for negotiations. At this point, Offerors will be notified in writing as to whether they
have been determined selectable, selectable with modification, or not selectable.
5.C. Negotiation and Contract Award
After selection and before award, the Government will contact Offerors whose proposals were
selected or selected with modifications to engage in negotiations. At that time, the Government
will also request a full cost proposal, as described in BAA Section 4.B.2. The Government will
review the cost proposal using the proposal analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1, as
appropriate, to determine a fair and reasonable cost. The Government’s evaluation will include
review of proposed anticipated costs/prices of the Proposer and those of associate, participating
organizations, to ensure the Offeror has fully analyzed the budget requirements, provided
sufficient supporting information, has adequate systems for managing the contract (accounting,
purchasing), and that data is traceable and reconcilable. The Government will also determine 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 56 of 88
whether the prospective contractor meets the responsibility standards of FAR Section 9.104.
Additional information and supporting data may be requested.
If proposed costs submitted are substantially different than the estimates provided in the technical
proposal, then a contract may not be awarded.
Procurement contracts, as determined by the contracting officer, shall be awarded to those
Offerors whose proposals are deemed most advantageous to the Government, all stated
evaluation factors considered, and pending the successful conclusion of negotiations.
5.D. Proposal Retention
Proposals shall not be returned upon completion of the source selection process. The original of
each proposal received shall be retained by the Government and all other non-required copiesshall
be destroyed. A certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal request is
sent to the Government via e-mail to dni-iarpa-rescind-BAAsubmission-2023@iarpa.gov within 5
days after notification of proposal results.
6. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION
6.A. Award
6.A.1. Communications and Award Notices
All questions or discussions regarding this solicitation must be directed to the Contracting Officer.
All communication throughout this process must be handled formally and through the proper
channels, which means all parties must ensure a Government Contract Specialist or Contracting
Officer is present and/or engaged during any and all communication exchanges. Any informal
communications or outside communication will delay and may also jeopardize a potential award.
As soon as practicable after the evaluation of a proposal is complete, the Offeror will be notified
that: (1) its proposal has been selected for negotiations, or (2) its proposal has not been selected
for negotiations.
6.A.2. Types of Awards
Procurement contracts will be made under this announcement. There are no limits on award
amounts.
6.A.3. Offer Preparation Reimbursement
The Government provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.
6.A.4. Obligating of the Government
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 57 of 88
Prospective Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit
the Government. Only Contracting Officers may obligate the Government to an agreement
involving the expenditure of Government funds. Any resultant procurement contract award would
include all clauses required by the FAR and appropriate supplements.
6.A.5. Security Guidance
Security classification guidance via a DD Form 254, “DoD Contract Security Classification
Specification,” will not be provided at this time since the Government is soliciting ideas only.
After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may
result in access to classified information, then a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part
of the award. Depending on the work to be performed, the Offeror may require a SECRET facility
clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified
effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the
Offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility
to support work under this BAA.
6.A.6. Proposal Handling
The Government has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which
require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by Offerors. Any
objection to access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed
statement of the basis for the objection.
6.A.7. Offer Markings
The government prefers that Offerors not include proprietary data in the Technical Proposals and
associated attachments. However, if an Offeror deems it necessary to include proprietary
information, then proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing proprietary
data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. If only portions of the page contain proprietary
information, then those specific portions should be clearly marked. It is the Proposer’s
responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered proprietary data. No
proposals containing classified information should be submitted under this announcement.
6.A.8. Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Offerors may propose perform work that is a continuation of a previously awarded SBIR research
project. However, Offerors shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no SBIR awardee may be
paid twice to perform the same task).
6.B. Other Administrative Information

Additional Contractual Requirements
If an Offeror and the Government accepts an Offeror’s proposal to use government resources in
performance of an award (e.g., GFP, GFI, GFE, GFC etc.), the resultant award will include
additional contractual requirements. The specific requirements will be determined for the
individual award.
6.B.5. Use of Arms, Ammunition and Explosives
Safety
The Offeror is required to be in compliance with DoD manual 4145.26-M, DoD Contractor’s
Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives if ammunitions and/or explosives are to be utilized
under the proposed research effort. (See DFARS 223.370-5 and DFARS 252.223-7002)
If ammunitions and/or explosives (A&E) are to be utilized under the proposed research effort, the
Government requires a preaward safety survey in accordance with DFARS PGI 223.370-4(C)(iv)
entitled Preaward survey. The Offeror is solely responsible for contacting the cognizant Defense
Contract Management Agency (DCMA) office and obtaining a required preaward safety survey
before proposal submission. The Offeror should include required preaward safety surveys with
proposal submissions.
If the Offeror proposes that the Government provide Government-furnished A&E containing any
nitrocellulose-based propellants and/or nitrate ester-based materials (such as nitroglycerin) or
other similar A&E with a tendency to become chemically unstable over time, then NMCARS
5252.223-9000 will also apply to a resulting contract award. (See NMCARS 5223.370-5)
Security
If arms, ammunition, or explosives (AA&E) are to be utilized under the proposed research effort,
the Government requires a preaward security survey. The Offeror is solely responsible for
contacting the cognizant DCMA office and obtaining a required preaward security survey before
proposal submission. The Offeror should include a required preaward security survey with
proposal submission. (See DoD manual 5100.76-M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional
Arms, Ammunition and Explosives, paragraph C1.3.1.4)
If AA&E are to be utilized under the proposed research effort, the Government may require the
Contractor to have perimeter fencing around the place of performance in accordance with DoD
5100.76-M, Appendix 2.
If AA&E are to be utilized under the proposed research effort, the Offeror is required to provide a
written copy of the Offeror’s AA&E accountability procedures in accordance with DoD 5100.76-

As per FAR 22.1802, recipients of FAR-based procurement contracts must enroll as Federal
Contractors in E-verify and use E-verify to verify employment eligibility of all employees assigned
to the award. All resultant contracts from this solicitation will include FAR 52.222-54,
“Employment Eligibility Verification.”
6.B.7. Reporting
Fiscal and management responsibility are important to the Program. Although the number and
types of reports shall be specified in the award document, all Offerors shall, at a minimum, provide
the CO, COTR and PM with monthly technical reports and monthly financial reports. The reports
shall be prepared and submitted in accordance with the procedures contained in the award
document and mutually agreed upon before award. Technical reports shall describe technical
highlights and accomplishments, priorities and plans, issues and concerns, evaluation results, and
future plans. Financial reports shall present an on-going financial profile of the project, including
total project funding, funds invoiced, funds received, funds expended during the preceding month,
and planned expenditures over the remaining period. Additional reports and briefing material may
also be required, as appropriate, to document progress in accomplishing program metrics.
The Offeror shall prepare and provide a research report of their work by month 18 for Phase 1, by
month 12 for Phase 2, and month 12 for Phase 3. The reports shall be delivered to the CO, COTR
and the PM. The reports shall include:
• Problem definition
• Findings and approach
• System design
• Possible generalization(s)
• Information on performance limitations and potential mitigation
• Anticipated path ahead
• Lessons learned (technical and programmatic)
• Final identification of all commercial, third-party, or proprietary hardware, software, or
technical data integrated into any deliverable and all applicable use restrictions.
• Any research products, including publications, data, and software, resulting from the
project during the reporting period. The final report shall list in-progress scientific
manuscripts and other research products.
6.B.8. Human Use
All research involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human
data, selected for funding must comply with the federal regulations (45 CFR 46) for human subject
protection. Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD
must comply with 32 CFR 219, Protection of Human Subjects (http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/textidx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title32/32cfr219_main_02.tpl), DoD Directive 3216.02, Protection of
Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 62 of 88
(http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf) and Department of Navy (DoN)
Instruction SECNAVINST 3900.39E CH-1.
Proposers should also be aware that selected performer contracts will be awarded from NIWC
Pacific (A DoD command), and as such the awarded contracts will be considered DOD supported
research. Any DOD supported contracts that include human subject research are subject to
oversight by a Government appointed Human Research Protection Official (HRPO). Prior to any
work performed with humans as test subjects, the Performer will be required to obtain not only
their Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, but also NIWC Pacific HRPO approval.
Institutions receiving funded awards that include research involving human subjects must provide
documentation of a current institutional Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for
human subject protection. A Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) example can be found at Department
of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp).
All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must also have a
valid Assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must provide
documentation of completing appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.
For all proposed research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project,
the Proposer must provide evidence of, or a plan for, review by an Institutional Review Board
(IRB) upon final proposal submission to NIWC Pacific. The IRB conducting the review must be
the IRB identified on the institution’s Assurance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must
include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study
participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. See Appendix
A.7 for a template of the IRB information that should be included in proposals with experimental
protocol submissions, as well as standard language for use in IRB submissions. The informed
consent document must comply with both federal (45 CFR 46.117) and DoD regulations (32 CFR
219.116). A valid Assurance along with evidence of appropriate training of all investigators should
accompany the protocol for review by the IRB.
Special DoD Considerations
For DoD-supported research in which the proposer believes it is exempt, or does not constitute
human subject research, they will be required to submit institutional documentation of this
determination to NIWC Pacific HRPO for concurrence. A determination of non-HSR or exemptHSR must be made by the Proposer’s IRB. All protocol documentation, including final IRB
determination letter, will be required for submission to obtain HRPO concurrence.
For all non-exempt human subject research, the selected Performer will be required to provide
documentation of a scientific review in the initial IRB package submitted for HRPO review. The
SECNAVINST 3900.39E CH-1 defines a scientific review as an independent review of the IRB
protocol conducted prior to IRB review (i.e., independent of the IRB review process). It can be
conducted in a variety of ways appropriate to the research and institution (e.g., by committee,
board, or single knowledgeable individual). However, the Government’s selection of proposal
for negotiation does not merit a scientific review. At a minimum, scientific review must meet
applicable conflict of interest rules and regulations, and should consider: human research 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 63 of 88
significance, adequacy of research approach; and competency of the investigator performing the
research. In addition, written Command approval is required for all research intending to use
military and/or DoD civilian subjects as part of their study. Documentation of this Command
approval should be included in the IRB protocol package prior to a Performer’s IRB approval.
The Performer should consult points of content from individual Army, Navy, or Air Force
Commands that are intended to be associated with subject recruitment for obtaining recruitment
approval guidance specific to that Command, if applicable.
The amount of time required to complete the IRB review/approval process may vary depending
on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants. Ample time should
be allotted to complete the approval process. The initial Performer IRB approval process can last
between one to three months, followed by a DoD review that could last between one to two months
for initial review, and up to 30 days for review of each IRB amendment approval. No DoD funding
can be placed on a contract toward human subject tasking until ALL approvals are granted and
documentation has been provided to NIWC Pacific for compliance verification and approval.
Proposals must separate out tasking and cost associated with human subject research to clearly
delineate which tasks and costs are associated with HSR.
6.B.9. Animal Use
No research proposals involving animal subjects shall be accepted under this BAA. Use of nonhuman primates is not permitted under this BAA.
6.B.10. Recombinant DNA
Proposals which call for experiments using recombinant DNA must include documentation of
compliance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recombinant DNA
regulations, approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and copies of the DHHS
Approval of the IBC letter.
6.B.11. Institutional Dual Use Research of Concern
As of September 24, 2015, all institutions and USG funding agencies subject to the United States
Government Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern
must comply with all the requirements listed therein. If your research proposal directly involves
certain biological agents or toxins, contact the cognizant Technical Point of Contact. U.S.
Government Science, Safety, Security (S3) guidance may be found at
http://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse.
6.B.12. Electronic and Information Technology
All electronic and information technology acquired through the BAA must satisfy the accessibility
requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794d) and FAR Subpart 39.2.
Each Proposer who submits a proposal involving the creation or inclusion of electronic and
information technology must ensure that Federal employees with disabilities will have access to 
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 64 of 88
and use of information that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not
individuals with disabilities. Additionally, each Proposer must ensure that members of the public
with disabilities seeking information or services from NIWC Pacific will have access to and use
of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by
members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.

Network Defenses (ReSCIND) Program. The IARPA ReSCIND program aims to
improve cybersecurity by understanding how human cognition impacts cyber
behavior and could affect cyber actors’ success in network attack activities.
Specifically, well-established cognitive patterns, such as loss aversion and the
representativeness bias, will be investigated as potentially mitigating factors in
the efficacy of cyber attack behavior. This research will contribute to ReSCIND’s
broader goals of improving cyber defense practices by delaying and thwarting
attacks.

Appendix A.8 Statement of Work (SOW) Template
STATEMENT OF WORK
PROJECT TITLE: [Insert short title of procurement requirement]
DATE: Insert the date of the SOW
1.0 SCOPE
The ‘Scope’ section should emphasize the most important/overarching aspects of the requirements
rather than minor details. It should identify the objective or purpose of the requirement and it should
help the reader understand the magnitude of the effort to be performed. It should also define
limitations/boundaries of the contractor’s performance responsibilities. The ‘scope’ section should be
consistent with the requirements specified under the ‘performance requirements’ section (2.0).
Remove this language after completing this section.
2.0 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The ‘Performance Requirements’ section will detail the technical performance requirements in clear,
concise terms. Performance requirements are generally identified as major tasks and subtasks. The
below is a sample format that must be catered to the tasking proposed. The inclusion of Options
(Phases) must be clearly delineated.
2.1 (Phase A) Task 1- Task Name
2.1.1 Sub Task
2.1.2 Sub Task
2.1.2.1 Specific Task
2.2 (Phase A) Task 2- Task Name
2.2.1 Sub Task
2.3 (Option 1 Phase B) Task 1- Task Name
2.3.1 Sub Task
2.4 (Option 1 Phase B) Task 2- Task Name
2.4.1 Sub Task
And so forth…
3.0 TRAVEL
The ‘Travel’ section will identify the estimated travel needed to perform the tasking, including the
travel location/destination, number of trips, number of people, and number of days/nights. It is
advantageous to include the word “estimated” (or similar) in this section. This will allow for
unanticipated changes to travel during task order performance without having to modify the order. If
traveling to foreign countries outside of the continental United States (OCONUS) is required, the
following language is mandatory: Remove this language after completing this section
Sample Language:
Anticipated travel includes XXX. Destinations and number of meetings may change upon request of
the IARPA Program Office. Attendance of reviews, workshops, and meetings are subject to approval
by the IARPA Program Manager or as outlined in the BAA.
4.0 PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS
ReSCIND Program BAA Page 80 of 88
• Identify Property Types Separately: Clearly address GFP items, other GP (Non-GFP) and GFI
separately in order to avoid confusion in the SOW and ensure proper Classifications as each
classification/type of property is handled differently. Address and explicitly state if none or some
of the five (5) property categories are anticipated as follows:
- Government Furnished Property (GFP). XXX
- Government Furnished Information (GFI). XXX
- Government Property (Incidental). XXX
- Government Furnished Facilities. XXX
- Contractor Acquired Property (CAP). XXX
Remove any instruction language after completing this section.
5.0 SECURITY
The work performed under this effort is anticipated to be unclassified.
6.0 DELIVERABLES
The ‘Deliverables’ provides a summary of deliverables due to the Government. This section may
simply make reference to other areas in this SOW and/or a list of the Exhibit A, Contract Data
Requirements List (CDRL). This section is encouraged as an overall summary to ensure clarity
depending on the complexity of the acquisition/program. This section clearly identifies the tangible
products or outcomes that the contractor is required to produce.
• A CDRL listing identifying the data item deliverables required under this contract and the
applicable section of the SOW for which they are required will be referenced here and Section J of
the resultant contract will include the DD Form 1423s that itemizes each CDRL required under the
contract. The contractor shall establish a practical and cost-effective system for developing and
tracking the required CDRLs generated under each task. Sample summary Table: Remove this
