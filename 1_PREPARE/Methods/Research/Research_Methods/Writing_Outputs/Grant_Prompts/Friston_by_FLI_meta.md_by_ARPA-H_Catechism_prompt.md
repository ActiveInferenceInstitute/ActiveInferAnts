        Grant Call (Agency Requirements):
        # Future of Life Institute (FLI): A Comprehensive Overview

## Mission and Vision

The Future of Life Institute's mission is to steer transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks. FLI believes that the development and use of powerful technology will be the most critical factor in determining the future prospects of life.

### Core Mission Statement

> Steering transformative technology towards benefiting life and away from extreme large-scale risks.

## Historical Context

Human civilization has been shaped by technology throughout history. However, we are now in an unprecedented era where:

- Humanity has the power to affect or destroy all life on Earth
- Life will be engineered by intelligence rather than evolution
- The rapidly increasing power of technologies like biotechnology and AI brings profound and perilous changes

## Key Initiatives and Strategies

1. **Policy Development and Advocacy**: Bridging the gap between technology experts and public institutions
2. **Outreach and Education**: Informing policymakers, technologists, and the public about challenges and opportunities
3. **Research and Research Support**: Supporting research on problems stemming from transformative technologies
4. **Grantmaking**: Funding research in fields insufficiently resourced by existing sources
5. **Institution-building**: Designing and launching new organizations to improve governance of transformative technologies
6. **Convening and Coordinating**: Organizing events and activities to promote global coordinated action

## Focus Areas

1. Advanced Artificial Intelligence
2. Militarized AI
3. Nuclear War
4. Pro-social Platforms
5. Climate Change (secondary focus)
6. Bio-risk and Biodiversity Preservation (secondary focus)

## Core Principles

1. **Impact-driven**: Prioritizing projects with large positive impact
2. **Cognizant of urgency**: Balancing action with analysis
3. **Forward-thinking and anticipatory**: Planning for foreseeable problems and opportunities
4. **Driven by science and reason**: Acting on humanity's understanding of the world
5. **Inclusive**: Honoring experiences, rights, and autonomy of people and sentient beings

## Primary Cause Areas

### 1. Artificial Intelligence

From recommender algorithms to chatbots to self-driving cars, AI is changing our lives. As the impact of this technology grows, so will the risks.

### 2. Biotechnology

The dangers from biotechnology, including accidental release of engineered pathogens or backfiring gene-editing experiments, are too great to proceed without caution.

### 3. Nuclear Weapons

Almost eighty years after their introduction, the risks posed by nuclear weapons remain high, with new research revealing even worse impacts than previously thought.
