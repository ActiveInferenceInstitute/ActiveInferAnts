### BAA Summary
IARPA seeks to develop and incorporate novel technologies and knowledge, leveraging the wider synthetic biology and biotechnology fields, to meet biosecurity threats of the 21st century. This includes developing new methods to collect, detect, analyze, and prevent traditional biothreats, while also addressing the latest opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with the advancing fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) invests in high-risk/high-payoff research programs that have the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage. IARPA seeks to develop new capabilities, matching the wider synthetic biology and biotechnology fields, ensuring the Intelligence Community’s (IC’s) capability to meet the biointelligence and biosecurity threats of the 21st century. This includes developing new ways to collect, detect, analyze, and prevent traditional biothreats while also addressing the promise and perils associated with the growing fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology. To address these challenges, the IC seeks to advance research across multiple sub-disciplines of biology.

In recent decades, the rise of synthetic biology has corresponded with critical advances in biology research. From polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1980s to next generation sequencing (NGS) in the late 90s to numerous mechanisms for genetic engineering enabling a variety of engineered organisms in the past decade, the branches of synthetic biology and enabling biotechnologies have advanced at a prodigious rate. The IC, and IARPA specifically, has pursued numerous research programs to advance security interests, but the needs of the IC require rapid advancement of numerous research topics to meet and leverage the advances the many biological disciplines have brought into reality in the past decades. These needs align with developing new methods for countering traditional biothreats of concern while also looking towards the future where bio-focused capabilities may enable or support IC relevant capabilities.

In particular, IARPA seeks novel research ideas from multidisciplinary teams pursuing advanced research topics capable of supporting the below interests:

- **Biointelligence**: Instruments, knowledge, and/or methods enhancing the IC’s capability to counter inappropriate use of biological sciences or leverage advancements derived from the biological sciences capable of advancing the IC’s ability to collect, analyze, characterize, secure, and utilize information related to threats to our nation.
- **Biosecurity**: Methods for ensuring the security of instruments, knowledge, environments, or capabilities aligned with biological research or advancements which have the potential to cause harm or detrimentally impact other organisms, materials, or infrastructure.

These technologies align well with needs of the intelligence and national security communities and are, therefore, under the purview of IARPA’s research mission. Successful technology solutions will require creative, multidisciplinary methods, paradigm changing thinking, and transformative approaches. Preference will be given to research with the ability to revolutionize capabilities and instruments or demonstrate that revolutionary change is possible in the coming decade. Critical interests align with technologies to improve targeting, collections, analysis, characterization, and mission specific capabilities. Multidisciplinary or convergent approaches derived from other technical fields and disciplines are welcome and encouraged.

This BAA solicits short-term, limited scope research in topic areas that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early-stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future.

Seedlings are structured as a Phase A base with a Phase B option. Phase A represents an initial proof of concept of the proposed approach. Phase B, if exercised, will build upon the proof-of-concept research in Phase A to deliver a demonstration. Phase A shall be of a duration of 9 months to demonstrate prototype proof-of-concept, with preliminary reports due at month 4 and month 8. The reports shall be used in evaluation of projects for continuation to Phase B. Phase B shall be no longer than 15 months in duration. Shorter duration projects, if appropriate for the subject matter, may be considered. See Figure 1 for a proposed project timeline.

**Figure 1: Proposed Phase A + B timeline with key activities.**

Proposals must explicitly address relevance of the technical approach to the future potential of biointelligence and biosecurity in the United States. Proposals shall demonstrate that the proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements to current capabilities. Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.

Proposals must include offeror-defined objectives, as well as milestones and performance metrics as task-driven intermediate steps towards the objectives.

### 1.1 Description of Topics and Areas of Interest

#### A. Biointelligence
- Methods and approaches for enabling attribution and/or origination of biological material, including organisms, that are not based purely upon individual databases, plasmid-focused analytics, isotopic ratios, or bioinformatics data.
- Platform-based, highly sensitive, target agnostic or multiplexable plug-and-play target-specific instrumentation for detection of biomolecules from complex samples or environments.
- Approaches for building biological systems capable of autonomous and consistent/repeatable responses and reporting outputs following non-Boolean logic based upon external stimuli to include advances in biocomputing, bioelectronics, and biological/biomolecule neural networks.
- Advanced approaches for loss-less, shelf-stable collection, separation, and/or sterilization of diverse biomolecules from complex environments (soil, water, and/or air).
- Approaches for integrating structured and unstructured, multi-modal data types, beyond bioinformatically derived, to identify poorly or under reported health incidents or changes in health status.

#### B. Biosecurity
- Methods for assuring digital and physical security associated with infrastructure, instrumentation, databases, and data associated with synthetic biology, biological samples, and biotechnologies from direct, indirect, remote, and stand-off analysis or intrusion.
- Methods for detecting and/or characterizing biological targets of interest to include venoms, toxins, community/environmental metabolomics, antibody paratopes (linear and conformational), non-canonical/synthetic biomolecules, and properties/effects of encapsulation.
- Methods and instruments for near and remote, >1 meter, passive detection or evaluation of health-status or health anomalies.
- Methods for reducing storage requirements, enabling improved security and analysis of large or mixed ‘omics datatypes, and improving transfer of pre-processed ‘omics data at scale from the point of generation.
- Methods for integrating and analyzing multi-modal data or materials, informing towards improved understanding and prediction, in near real-time, of research activities, timelines, objectives.

The following topics are out of scope for this seedling effort: research focused purely on improving biosafety in the laboratory or the field; research focused on systems integration of existing approaches or instruments; research focused entirely on improving size, weight, or power requirements associated with existing instrumentation; research focused entirely on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2; research focused on developing or improving medical countermeasures or therapeutics; research focused on topics at a technology readiness level of 4 or above; and/or research which are resubmissions of work already awarded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Intelligence Community, or other federal agencies.

### 1.2 Proposal Information and Structure
The Government anticipates that proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.

Proposals must address two independent and sequential project phases: Phase A - Initial Proof of Concept (base) and Phase B - Demonstration (option). The periods of performance for these phases shall not exceed 9 months for Phase A and 15 months for Phase B. Combined Phase A and Phase B shall not exceed 24 months.

## 2. Award Information

### 2.1 General Award Information
The BAA shall result in awards for both Phases of the seedling. Exercise of the Phase B option shall depend upon performance during Phase A - base as well as program goals, the availability of funding, and IARPA priorities. Exercising of the Phase B option is at the sole discretion of the Government. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available under this BAA shall depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.

The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary. Evaluation and award of proposals will follow FAR Part 35 processes as described herein.

Proposals selected for negotiation may result in a procurement contract. Awards under this BAA shall be made to Offerors on the basis of the Evaluation Factors listed herein, as well as successful completion of negotiations.

This announcement constitutes the full solicitation package. This solicitation will be conducted in two steps:

**STEP ONE** – Submission of white papers. This submission is required to continue to step two.

**STEP TWO** – A reasonable number of Offerors apparently qualified to respond to the intent of this BAA who submit whitepapers in step one will be approved and notified to submit a technical and cost proposal. Offerors not approved to submit a proposal from step one or that do not submit a whitepaper will not have their proposals reviewed by the government. All proposals must be submitted by the due date listed in Section 1 of this BAA.

See Section 4.0 of this announcement for further details regarding the proposal requirements.

Upon evaluation, the Government will contact Offerors whose proposals are selected for negotiations and may request additional information required for award. The Government may establish a deadline for the close of fact-finding and negotiations that allows a reasonable time for the award of a contract. Offerors that are not responsive to Government deadlines established and communicated with the request may be removed from award consideration. Offerors may also be removed from award consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms, conditions, and cost/price.

### 2.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Organizations may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the BAA. However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are selected, such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can be paid twice to perform the same task).

## 3. Eligibility Information

### 3.1 Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit proposals; however, no portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas for exclusive competition among these entities. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, University Affiliated Research Centers, Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated facilities, Government Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization that has a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or proprietary information or access to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to submit proposals under this BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. An entity of which only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligible to submit a proposal or participate as a team member subject to an organizational conflict of interest review.

#### 3.1.1 U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate officials of the institution.”

Offerors shall submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter for each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is serving in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their proposal. Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g., President, Chancellor, Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter is enclosed in Appendix A of this BAA. Note: It is highly recommended that this letter(s) be submitted with the Offeror’s proposal. In any case, IARPA shall not enter into negotiations with an Offeror whose team includes a U.S. academic institution until all required Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.

#### 3.1.2 Foreign Entities
Foreign entities and/or individuals may participate only as a prime if they are registered with SAM.gov and have a United States bank account or as part of a U.S. based team. The prime contractor must be a U.S. company in the case the entities or individuals do not have an account or are not registered with SAM.gov. All foreign participation must comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances. Offerors are expected to ensure that the efforts of foreign participants do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the United States, nor its security interests. As such, all Offerors should carefully consider the roles and responsibilities of foreign participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.

### 3.2 Organizational Conflicts of Interest
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” (OCI) means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.

In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to potential OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (subawardee, consultant). Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each proposal submitted pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include a description of the actions the Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.

BAA Summary – IARPA seeks to develop and incorporate novel technologies and knowledge,
leveraging the wider synthetic biology and biotechnology fields, to meet biosecurity threats of the
21st century. This includes developing new methods to collect, detect, analyze, and prevent
traditional biothreats, while also addressing the latest opportunities and vulnerabilities associated
with the advancing fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology.
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) invests in high-risk/high-payoff
research programs that have the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence
advantage. IARPA seeks to develop new capabilities, matching the wider synthetic biology and
biotechnology fields, ensuring the Intelligence Community’s (IC’s) capability to meet the
biointelligence and biosecurity threats of the 21st century. This includes developing new ways to
collect, detect, analyze, and prevent traditional biothreats while also addressing the promise and
perils associated with the growing fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology. To address these
challenges, the IC seeks to advance research across multiple sub-disciplines of biology.
In recent decades, the rise of synthetic biology has corresponded with critical advances in biology
research. From polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1980s to next generation sequencing (NGS)
in the late 90s to numerous mechanisms for genetic engineering enabling a variety of engineered
organisms in the past decade, the branches of synthetic biology and enabling biotechnologies have
advanced at a prodigious rate. The IC, and IARPA specifically, has pursued numerous research
programs to advance security interests, but the needs of the IC require rapid advancement of
numerous research topics to meet and leverage the advances the many biological disciplines have
brought into reality in the past decades. These needs align with developing new methods for
countering traditional biothreats of concern while also looking towards the future where bio-focused
capabilities may enable or support IC relevant capabilities.
In particular, IARPA seeks novel research ideas from multidisciplinary teams pursuing advanced
research topics capable of supporting the below interests:
• Biointelligence –Instruments, knowledge, and/or methods enhancing the IC’s capability to
counter inappropriate use of biological sciences or leverage advancements derived from the
biological sciences capable of advancing the IC’s ability to collect, analyze, characterize, secure,
and utilize information related to threats to our nation; and
• Biosecurity - Methods for ensuring the security of instruments, knowledge, environments, or
capabilities aligned with biological research or advancements which have the potential to cause
harm or detrimentally impact other organisms, materials, or infrastructure.
These technologies align well with needs of the intelligence and national security communities and
are, therefore, under the purview of IARPA’s research mission. Successful technology solutions will
require creative, multidisciplinary methods, paradigm changing thinking, and transformative
approaches. Preference will be given to research with the ability to revolutionize capabilities and
instruments or demonstrate that revolutionary change is possible in the coming decade. Critical
interests align with technologies to improve targeting, collections, analysis, characterization, and
mission specific capabilities. Multidisciplinary or convergent approaches derived from other
technical fields and disciplines are welcome and encouraged. 
5
This BAA solicits short-term, limited scope research in topic areas that are not addressed by
emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but
not solely, intended for early-stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a
separate BAA in the future.
Seedlings are structured as a Phase A base with a Phase B option. Phase A represents an initial proof
of concept of the proposed approach. Phase B, if exercised, will build upon the proof-of-concept
research in Phase A to deliver a demonstration. Phase A shall be of a duration of 9 monthsto
demonstrate prototype proof-of-concept, with preliminary reports due at month 4 and month 8.The
reports shall be used in evaluation of projects for continuation to Phase B. Phase B shall be no longer
than 15 months in duration. Shorter duration projects, if appropriate for the subject matter, may be
considered. See Figure 1 for a proposed project timeline.
Figure 1: Proposed Phase A + B timeline with key activities.
Proposals must explicitly address relevance of the technical approach to the future potential of
biointelligence and biosecurity in the United States. Proposals shall demonstrate that the
proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements
to current capabilities. Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the
existing state of practice is specifically excluded.
Proposals must include offeror-defined objectives, as well as milestones and performance
metrics as task-driven intermediate steps towards the objectives.
1.1 Description of Topics and Areas of Interest
A. Biointelligence
• Methods and approaches for enabling attribution and/or origination of biological material,
including organisms, that are not based purely upon individual databases, plasmid-focused
analytics, isotopic ratios, or bioinformatics data;
• Platform-based, highly sensitive, target agnostic or multiplexable plug-and-play targetspecific instrumentation for detection of biomolecules from complex samples or

However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are selected,
such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity canbe paid 
8
twice to perform the same task).
3 Eligibility Information
3.1 Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses
and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit
proposals; however, no portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these organizations’
participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas for exclusive
competition among these entities. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and
Development Centers, University Affiliated Research Centers, Government-Owned, ContractorOperated facilities, Government Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization that
has a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or
proprietary information or access to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to
submit proposals under this BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by
eligible entities. An entity of which only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligibleto
submit a proposal or participate as a team member subject to an organizational conflict of interest
review.
3.1.1 U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or
services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the
sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or
arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate
officials of the institution.”
Offerors shall submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter for
each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is serving
in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their proposal.
Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g., President, Chancellor,
Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the Academic Institution
Acknowledgment Letter is enclosed in Appendix A of this BAA. Note: It is highly recommended
that this letter(s) be submitted with the Offeror’s proposal. In any case, IARPA shall not enter into
negotiations with an Offeror whose team includes a U.S. academic institution until all required
Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.
3.1.2 Foreign Entities
Foreign entities and/or individuals may participate only as a prime if they are registered with
SAM.gov and have a United States bank account or as part of a U.S. based team. The prime
contractor must be a U.S. company in the case the entities or individuals do not have an account or
are not registered with SAM.gov. All foreign participation must comply with any necessary NonDisclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws and other governing statutes
applicable under the circumstances. Offerors are expected to ensure that the efforts of foreign
participants do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the United States, nor its
security interests. As such, all Offerors should carefully consider the roles and responsibilities of
foreign participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.
3.2 Organizational Conflicts of Interest
9
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” (OCI) means that because of other
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render
impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the
contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to
potential OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (subawardee,
consultant). Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each
proposal submitted pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as
applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must includea
description of the actions the Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of
conflicting roles that might bias the Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an
unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCIin
the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits Contractors from concurrently providing Scientific Engineering
Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), or similar support
services and being a technical Contractor. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement
above, address whether an Offeror or an Offeror’s team member (e.g. sub-awardee, consultant) is
providing SETA, A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under: (a) a current
award or subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward.
• If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal
must include: The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
• The prime contract number; and
• Identification of proposed team member (sub-awardee, consultant) providing the
support.
As part of their proposal, Offerors shall include either (a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates have
any potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in Appendix
A.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise
selectable under the BAA Evaluation Factors.
The Government may require Offerors to provide additional information to assist the Government in
evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans.
If the Government determines that an Offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide
the affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by Government to assist in evaluating the Offeror’s OCI and proposed OCI
mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for
award.
4 Application and Submission Information
STEP ONE – White Paper Submission: Interested Offerors are required to submit white papers
prior to proposal submissions. White papers will be accepted until 5:00 PM ET, 25 July, 2022.
The Government anticipates that Offerors will receive a response to their white paper within 30 days 
10
of submission stating whether the Government approves the offeror to step two of this BAA,
submission of a proposal. The purpose of the white paper is to ensure proposals are submitted from
a reasonable number of apparently qualified sources with technical approaches/solutions of interest
to the Government.
STEP TWO – Proposal submission: Upon review of the white papers from step one, the
Government anticipates approving a reasonable number of apparently qualified offerors, whose
research ideas are of interest to the Government, to submit full proposals (Volume I, Technical and
Management Proposal, Volume 2 Cost/Price Proposal). In order to receive consideration for award,
Offerors must have received approval for submission in step one from the Government associated
with their white paper and compliant proposals should be received by the proposal due date in Section
1 of the BAA. Proposals received after this date will be considered late and may not be reviewed. If
there are any subsequent rounds of selection, the BAA will be amended to notify Offerors and to
provide the proposal due date forthe next round of selections. Selection for award remains
contingent on the technical and fundingavailability evaluation factors. Offerors not approved to
submit a proposal from step one or that do not submit a whitepaper will not have their proposals
reviewed by the government.
The Government intends to use Booz Allen Hamilton, Serco, Patriot Solutions Group, Airlin
Technologies, Bluemont Technology and Research, Navstar, Crimson Phoenix, Northwood Global
Solutions, and Onts & Quants, Inc., along with SMEs from other Government laboratories, federally
funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), and University-affiliated research centers
(UARCs) or to provide expert advice, regarding portions of the white papers and proposals submitted
to the Government and to provide logistical support in carrying out the evaluation process. All
Government and Contractor personnel shall have signed and be subject to the terms and conditions
of non-disclosure agreements. By submission of its white paper and/or proposal, an Offeror agrees
that its white paper and/or proposal information may be disclosed to employees of these
organizations for the limited purposes stated above. Offerors who object to this arrangement shall

is based.
4.2.2 Volume 2: Cost/Price Proposal (No page Limit)
IARPA anticipates awarding Cost type procurement contracts. However, Offerors may request other
than a Cost type procurement contract (e.g. FFP, cost-share).
Regardless of the type of contract, the Offeror’s cost/price proposal shall contain sufficient
supporting information to establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project, the perception of
project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to support the realism and
reasonableness of the proposed cost/price, to the extent appropriate.
Offerors shall provide the detailed cost supporting information addressed below and in the Volume 2
Cost Element Spreadsheet, Appendix A. Offerors may submit alternative cost/price supporting
information or information in a different format; however, this will be subject to a CO determination
of acceptability. If alternative information and formatting are not found acceptable, the CO will
request the Offeror provide appropriate cost supporting information during negotiations. Examples
where alternative cost/price supporting information and formatting may be found acceptable are
when submitted by non-traditional contractors such as commercial entities that do not typically
accept FAR-based contracts, small businesses, start-up companies or foreign companies.
The Cost/Price Volume shall include the following:
A. Cost Element Breakdown and Total Cost Summary
Offerors shall submit an Excel document, in the format provided in Appendix A. It shall include
intact formulas and shall not be hard numbered. The base and option period cost data should roll up
into a total cost summary. The Excel files may be write-protected but shall not be password
protected.
• Completed cost element breakdown for the base period, option period and the total project
summary in the format provided in Appendix A.
• Total costs broken down by major task.
B. Narrative Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient
detail to substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the basis of estimate
(BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable: 
15
Direct Labor –Describe the basis of the proposed labor categories and rates and provide a copy of
the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) with the Government. If Offerors do not
have a current FPRA with the Government, provide payroll records or contingency hire letters with
salary data to support each proposed labor category, including those for key individuals, and the
most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal Submission, if applicable. Offeror should also address
whether any portion of their labor rates is attributable to uncompensated overtime.
Labor Escalation Factor – State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g., based
upon Global Insight indices, Cost Index or historical data). If the escalation rate is based upon
historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample calculation
demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor.
Subcontracts (to include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs) – The Offeror is
responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume.
Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, option period and the total
summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Appendix A). Consultant
letter(s) of commitment shall also be attached.
Information shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided in Appendix
A. The Offeror shall also provide justification for why the subcontractor was selected and its
determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable (Reference FAR Part 44 and FAR clause
52.244-2). If subcontractors have concerns about proprietary cost information, subcontractors can
submit their detailed cost proposal information directly to the CO during negotiations.
Materials and Equipment – Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data or any other
information including Offeror’s analysis to support proposed costs.
Travel - The proposed travel supporting detail shall include destination and purpose of the trip,
number of trips, number of travelers and days per trip and price per traveler in sufficient detail to
verify the BOE. Limited travel is anticipated. Offerors may require travel to meet with team
members. Offerors will not be required to travel to meet with IARPA. Proposed travel costs shall
comply with the limitations set forth in FAR Part 31.
Conference travel will not be authorized under this contract.
Other Direct Costs (ODCs) – ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes, historical
data or any other information including the Offeror’s analysis.
Indirect Costs – The Offeror shall show indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect rate
by fiscal year and period (base, option) and provide information on indirect cost pools and allocation
bases for each year and program period involved. If a Government agency recently audited the
Offeror’s indirect rates, the Offeror shall identify the agency that conducted the audit,when the rates
were approved and the period for which they are effective. Include a copy of this rate agreement.
Absent current Government rate recommendations, it is incumbent on the Offerorto provide some
other means of demonstrating indirect rate realism (e.g., 3 years of historical actual costs with
applicable pools and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly from historical experience, the
Offeror shall explain of the variance.
Cost sharing – Describe the source, nature and amount of cost-sharing, if any. (Acceptable formsof
cost share include (but may not be limited to): Cash contributions (application of discretionary
resources) from prime Offeror and/or subcontractor(s); unreimbursed labor; materials and
equipment; use of materials or equipment for program duration (lease value equivalent); and IP with
established market value. Non- acceptable forms of cost share include (but may not be limitedto):
foregone fee; foregone G&A and COM if using independent research and development (IR&D) as 
16
cost share; valuation of IP with no established market value; facilities or other assets accounted for
in overhead rates applied to labor; and capital assets without clear and direct contribution to the
program.)
Other Pricing Assumptions – Identify all pricing assumptions, that should be incorporated into the
resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished Property/Facilities/Information,
access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.).
Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM) – If proposing FCCM, the Offeror shall show FCCM cost
calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and program yearand
provide a copy of the Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA), Forward Price Rate System (FPRS)
or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR), if available.
Profit/Fee - Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base. Provide
justification for your proposed profit or fee.
Systems - For the systems listed below, provide a brief description of the cognizant federal agency
and audit results. If the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short narrative describing
the steps your organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the current status.If a formal
audit has been performed by a Government Agency, please provide a complete copy of the audit
report or adequacy determination letter. If the system has never received a formal Government
review and approval include a statement to that effect. Address whether your organization has
contracts that are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered and if so, whether they are subject to
full or modified CAS coverage.
• Accounting system (if proposing a cost reimbursement contract)
4.3 White Paper and Proposal Submission Information
White papers and proposals shall be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and
Evaluation System (IDEAS). Offerors interested in providing a submission in response to this BAA
shall first register by electronic means in accordance with the instructions provided on the following
web site: https://iarpa-ideas.gov. Offerors are strongly encouraged to register a few days prior to the
due date. Offerors who do not register in advance do so at their own risk, and IARPA shall not
extend the due date to accommodate such Offerors. Failure to register as stated shall prevent the
Offeror’s submittal of documents.
After registration has been approved, Offerors should upload a white paper or proposal, in ‘pdf’
format, or as otherwise directed (Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Offerors are responsible for ensuring
compliant and timely submissions. Time management to upload and submit is wholly the
responsibility of the Offeror. The submittal due date and time for white papers is 5:00pm ET 25
July, 2022. The submittal due date and time for proposals is 5:00pm ET, 13 September, 2022.
Upon completing the white paper or proposal submission, the Offeror shall receive an automated
confirmation email from IDEAS. The Government strongly suggests that the Offeror document the
submission of their white paper or proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and date
stamped) that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a white paper or
proposal to the IDEAS website.
Should an Offeror be unable to complete the electronic submittal, the Offeror shall employ the
following procedure. The Offeror shall send an e-mail dni-iarpa-B24IC-BAASubmission2022@iarpa.gov, prior to the due date and time specified in the BAA and indicate that an attempt
was made to submit electronically and that the submittal was unsuccessful. This e-mail shall include
contact information for the Offeror. Upon receipt of such notification, the Government will provide
17
additional guidance regarding submission. White papers or proposals submitted by any means other
than IDEAS shall not be considered unless the Offeror notified the Government of its unsuccessful
attempted electronic submittal and complied with the Government’s subsequent guidance regarding
submission.
It is at the Government’s sole discretion whether to call for a second round of proposals. Selection
of any subsequent rounds remains contingent on the technical and funding availability evaluation
factors.
Submissions received after the due date and time are deemed to be late and may not be reviewed.
Failure to comply with the submission procedures may result in the submittal not being evaluated.
Although classified proposals are not anticipated for this program, if an Offeror chooses to submita
classified white paper or proposal, the Offeror must first contact the Government via dni-iarpaB24IC-BAASubmission-2022@iarpa.gov and request consideration. The Government reserves the
right not to accept classified proposals or supporting information. In no case shall classified
information be uploaded into IDEAS.
Regarding proprietary markings, Offerors are responsible for clearly identifying proprietary
information. Submissions containing proprietary information must have the cover page and each
page containing such information clearly marked with a label such as “Proprietary.” NOTE:
“Confidential” is a classification marking used to control the dissemination of U.S. Government
National Security Information and should not be used to identify proprietary business information.
See BAA Section 6.2.1 for additional information on Proprietary Data.
5 Evaluation of White Papers/Proposals
White papers:
White papers will be reviewed by Government Technical expert(s) to determine a reasonable
number of Offerors apparently qualified to meet the intent of the BAA. This determination will be
based on the Offeror presenting technical qualifications specific to the field of science and
technology needed for the technical approach/solution presented, and the Government’s interest in
the Offeror’s intended technical approach/solution. Program balance across Topics and Areas of
Interest and program budget constraints may also be considerations in determining a reasonable
number of Offerors permitted to submit Proposals.
The Government will conduct rolling reviews of white papers. Submittal time may impact when an
Offeror receives the Government’s notice of whether their proposal is approved, however all efforts
will be made to provide a response within two weeks days of submission.
Based on the above determination, Offerors will either be approved to submit a proposal or not
approved to submit a proposal. Proposals will be reviewed as set forth in this BAA. Offerors not
approved to submit a proposal from step one or that do not submit a whitepaper will not have their
proposals reviewed by the government.
Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their
proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
Proposals:
Proposals will be evaluated in line with FAR Part 35 and as described below.
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this BAA are described in the
following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be evaluated on its
18
own merits and its relevance to the BAA goals rather than against other proposals submitted in
response to this BAA.
The proposals shall be evaluated on the basis of technical evaluation and funding availability factors.
The technical evaluation and funding availability factors are of equal importance. Withinthe
technical evaluation factor, the specific technical criteria are in descending order of importance, as
follows: Overall Scientific and Technical Merit and Potential Contribution and Relevance to the
IARPA Mission. Within the funding availability factor, the sub criteria are of equal importance.
Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided below.
Awards will be made on the basis of the technical evaluation and funding availability factors, and
subject to successful negotiations with the Government. Award shall not be made to Offeror(s)
whose proposal(s) are determined not to be selectable.
Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their
proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
5.1 Technical Evaluation Factor (sub criteria are in descending order of importance)
Proposals will be evaluated using the following technical criteria, listed in descending order of
importance, to determine whether proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA
and of interest to the Government:
A. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Evaluators will assess the extent to which:
- The proposed technical approach is novel, innovative, feasible, achievable, and complete.
- The proposed technical team has the expertise and experience to accomplish the proposed
tasks.
- Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical
sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final outcome that
achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award.
- The proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly
defined and feasible.
B. Potential Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission
Evaluators will also assess the potential contributions of the proposed effort to bolster the national
security technology base, and support IARPA’s mission to make pivotal early technology
investments that create or prevent technological surprise. Additionally, evaluators will assess the
extent to which the proposed intellectual property restrictions (if any) will impact the Government’s
ability to utilize and transition the technology to partners.
5.2 Funding Availability Factor (sub criteria are of equal importance)
A. Budget Constraints
The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting the BAA objectives within budget
constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts. Note: If the Offeror has submitted
the proposal to other federal, state or local agencies or other parties that may fund the proposed
effort, this may impact the Government’s decision to fund the effort.
19
B. Program Balance
The Government will take into account IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives to ensure a
balanced approach to achieving program goals. This may include, but is not limited to, broadening
the variety of technical approaches and developing capabilities aligned with IC priorities.
5.3 Review and Selection Process
It is the policy of the Government to ensure impartial, equitable and comprehensive proposal
evaluations. The Government anticipates more than one award. Given the Government’s limited
resources anddesire to issue awards rapidly for this requirement, proposals may be evaluated and
awarded on a rolling basis. Topic and Area of Interest mayalso be factors in determining the order
in which proposals are evaluated in order to ensure program balance. Additionally, the Government
may discontinue evaluating proposals when available funding is exhausted. If new funds become
available, prior to proposal expiration, the Government may restart proposal evaluations and issue
additional awards.
Selection for negotiation will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process. A qualified
Government Reviewer(s) will assess each proposal’s strengths, weaknesses, and risks2
 against the
technical criteria. If necessary, non-Government technical experts with specialized expertise may
advise the Reviewer(s). However, only Government personnel will make recommendations and
selection determinations under this BAA. When the Government has completed its proposal review,
the Reviewer(s) will provide its findings and technical recommendations to the IARPA Scientific
Review Official (SRO).
The SRO will make the final decision as to selectability for negotiations based on the technical
recommendation and all stated factors (technical evaluation factor and funding availability factor).
At this point, Offerors will be notified in writing as to whether they have been determined selectable
or not selectable. For the purposes of this proposal evaluation process, these terms are defined as
follows:
Selectable: A selectable proposal is a proposal that has been evaluated by the Government against
the evaluation factors listed in the BAA, and determined to be technically competent, aligned to
IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives, and funding is available. The technicalstrengthsof
the proposal outweigh any technical weaknesses and risks. Additionally, there are no technical
weaknesses that would require other than minor negotiation. The proposal can now move to the
negotiation and award process.
Non-Selectable: A proposal is considered non-selectable when the proposal has been evaluated by
the Government against the evaluation factors listed in the BAA and determined to be technically
weak, not aligned with IARPA’s overall mission and the BAA objectives, or funding is not
available.
Contract award is contingent on CO determination of a fair and reasonable cost/price and contract
agreement on terms and conditions.
5.4 Negotiation and Award

2 Strength- An aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has appreciable merit or appreciably exceeds specified performance or capability requirements
in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance.
Weakness – A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
Risk - The potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an Offeror’s proposed
approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance,
the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. 
20
After selection and before award, the CO will contact Offerors whose proposals were determined
selectable to engage in negotiations. The CO will review the cost/price proposal using the proposal
analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1, as appropriate, to determine a fair and reasonable
cost/price. The CO’s evaluation will include review of proposed anticipated costs/prices of the
Offeror and proposed subcontractors, to ensure the Offeror has fully analyzed the budget
requirements, provided sufficient supporting information, has adequate systems for managing the
contract (i.e., accounting, purchasing as applicable), and that data is traceable and reconcilable. The
CO’s evaluation will also determine whether the prospective contractor understands the project and
its risks and has the ability to organize and perform the work and that, the Offeror meets the
responsibility standards of FAR 9.104. Additional information and supporting data may be
requested.
Procurement contracts, as determined by the contracting officer, shall be awarded to those Offerors
whose proposals are deemed most advantageous to the Government, all stated evaluation factors
considered, and pending the successful conclusion of negotiations.
5.5 Proposal Retention
Proposals shall not be returned upon completion of the source selection process. The original of
each proposal received shall be retained at IARPA and all other non-required copies shall be
destroyed. A certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal request is sentto
IARPA via e-mail to dni-iarpa-B24IC-BAASubmission-2022@iarpa.gov within 5 days after
notification of proposal results.
6 Award Administration Information
6.1 Communications and Award Notices
All questions or discussions regarding this solicitation must be directed to the Contracting Specialist
and/or Officer. All communication throughout this process must be handled formally and through
the proper channels, which means all parties must ensure a Government Contract Specialist or
Contracting Officer is present and/or engaged during any and all communication exchanges. Any
informal communications or outside communication will delay and may also jeopardize a potential
award.
As soon as practicable after the evaluation of a proposal is complete, the Offeror will be notified
that: (1) its proposal has been selected for negotiations, or (2) its proposal has not been selected for
negotiations.
6.1.2 Types of Awards
Procurement contracts will be made under this announcement. There are no limits on award
amounts.
6.1.3 Obligating of the Government

Government. Only Contracting Officers may obligate the Government to an agreement involving
the expenditure of Government funds. Any resultant procurement contract award would include all
clauses required by the FAR and appropriate supplements.
6.1.4 Security Guidance
Security classification guidance via a DD Form 254, “DoD Contract Security Classification
Specification,” will not be provided at this time since the Government is soliciting ideas only. After 
21
reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result
in access to classified information a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.
Depending on the work to be performed, the Offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and
safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be
cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the Offeror may be
required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work
under this BAA.
6.1.5 Proposal Handling
The Government has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which
require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by Offerors. Any objection
to access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the
basis for the objection.
6.1.6 Offer Markings
All proposals containing proprietary data should have the cover page and each page containing
proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. If only portions of the page contain
proprietary information, those portions should be clearly marked. It is the Proposer’s responsibility
to clearly define to the Government what is considered proprietary data. No proposals containing
classified information should be submitted under this announcement.
6.2 Other Administrative Information
6.2.1 Intellectual Property
General. The Government may request additional information from the Offeror, as may be
necessary, to evaluate the Offeror’s IP rights assertions. If Offerors do not identify any restrictions
with respect to the proposed deliverables, the Government shall assume in its review of the proposal
that the Government will receive Unlimited Rights in accordance with FAR 52.227-11. Further,
failure to provide complete information may result in a determination that the proposal is not
compliant with the solicitation, and the Government reserves the right to reject a proposal if the
Offeror does not appropriately address all required IP rights issues.
IP Ownership. The Government’s rights will be in accordance with the resulting contract which will
include but may not be limited to FAR 52.227-11, 52.227-14, 52.227-16 and IA52.227-702.
Regardless of the scope of the Government’s rights, Offerors receiving contracts under this BAA
may freely use IP generated under the contract for their own commercial purposes unless restricted
by U.S. export control laws or security classification. Therefore, technical data and computer
software developed under any contract resulting from this solicitation will remain the property of
the Contractor,subject to IARPA’srights asset forth in the contract. For inventions first conceivedor

(a) Definition. “Export-controlled items,” as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:
(1) “Defense items,” defined in the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778(j)(4)(A), as defense
articles, defense services, and related technical data, and further defined in the ITAR, 22 CFR Part
120.
(2) “Items,” defined in the EAR as “commodities”, “software”, and “technology,” terms that are also
defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.
23
(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled
items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department
of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State
regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department
of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.
(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding
export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information
provided by this clause.
(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements
of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to—
(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);
(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);
(3) The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.);
(4) The Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774);
(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and

concerns to be considered fairly as sub-contractors to contractors performing work or rendering
services as prime contractors or sub-contractors under Government contracts and to assure that
prime contractors and sub-contractors carry out this policy. Each Offeror that is selected for
negotiation for award and is expected to be awarded a contract which exceeds the simplified
acquisition threshold may be asked to submit a sub-contracting plan before award in accordance
with FAR 19.702(a) (1). The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704.
Offerors shall declare teaming relationships in their Technical and Cost proposals and shall specify
the type of teaming arrangement in place, including any exclusive teaming arrangements. IARPA
neither promotes nor discourages the establishment of exclusive teaming agreements within
Proposer teams. Individuals or organizations associated with multiple teams shall take care not to
over-commit those resources being applied.
6.2.5 Reporting
Fiscal and management responsibility are important to the Government. Although the number and
types of reports shall be specified in the award document, all Offerors shall, at a minimum, provide
