Summary Of Program Requirements
General Information
Program Title:

NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds (NQVL)
Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD): II. Design & Implementation

Synopsis of Program:

The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act1 aims to ensure the continuing leadership of the United States (U.S.) in quantum information science and technology. In conformance with the NQI goals, an argument2, 3, 4, 5 was set forth for a renewed emphasis on identifying and fostering early adoption of quantum technologies to transform the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) and to accelerate broader impacts on society. A systematic approach to maturing quantum technology platforms by integrating end-users and potential customers from other fields of science and engineering and other sectors of the economy into cycles of research, development, and demonstration should lower the barriers for end-users to pioneer new applications. NSF support for use-inspired and translational research in QISE, combined with continued strong support of the underlying foundational research, is anticipated to accelerate development of a market for quantum technologies.

With this program solicitation, the Foundation is taking the next step in implementing the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept as an overarching shared infrastructure designed to facilitate the translation from basic science and engineering to the resultant technology, while at the same time emphasizing and advancing its scientific and technical value. The NQVL aims to develop and utilize use-inspired and application-oriented quantum technologies. In the process, NQVL researchers will explore quantum frontiers6, foster the development of QISE education and workforce development strategies, engage in outreach activities at all levels, and promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE, thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. Engagement with all sectors of the United States (U.S.) QISE community will be necessary for this initiative to succeed, and, indeed, the project is designed to include participation from a full spectrum of organizations who have expertise to contribute. In particular, NSF recognizes that the involvement of industry partners is essential and will welcome these to be a part of the overall structure. Partnerships with other U.S. Federal agencies under the NQI umbrella are also encouraged.

While this solicitation lays out the vision for the entire NQVL program that includes Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects, support for enabling technologies through Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS), as well as a central coordination hub, only proposals for Design- and Implementation-phase QSTDs are solicited at this time.

Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. The QSTD:Design project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Pilot phase.

Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. The QSTD:Implementation project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Design phase.

It is required that prospective PIs contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposal is appropriate for this solicitation.

I. Introduction
The translation from basic knowledge to new, scalable technologies that can provide solutions to real-world problems is a multi-step process that requires prototyping, validation, at-scale testing, and eventual full-scale demonstration. As an approach to achieving this goal for quantum-related technologies, NSF has instituted the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept. The overarching goal of the NQVL is the demonstration of practical quantum advantage, the actual application of the tools of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) to problems that will enable solutions that classical approaches can only solve much less efficiently or not at all.

The NQVL vision is to support a highly accessible shared research infrastructure framework that draws on the full spectrum of expertise throughout the Nation to rapidly translate QISE ideas formulated in the laboratory through prototyping, validation, at-scale testing, and eventual full-scale deployment. A co-design approach will facilitate the quick transfer of discoveries from one phase to the next, enable the rapid identification of gaps, and draw on the talent necessary to close these gaps. A key focus of the program will be to develop education and workforce development strategies that promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE by expanding access to state-of-the-art resources and prototypes to all parts of the U.S. research ecosystem. While the completed NQVL will consist of a set of primary nodes defined by the major Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration projects defined below, the overall structure is designed to serve as a resource for the community at large, facilitating the flow of talent and ideas through a central coordination body.

The successful translation of QISE research under the NQVL will require the integration of several layers, from fundamental principles to prototypes to applications, utilizing a convergent, systems engineering, and co-design approach. The co-design of enabling technologies (e.g., reliable materials fabrication, scalable device manufacturing, dependable quantum interconnects, or robust software stack) and sufficiently mature physical platforms will result in Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD) for scientific discovery that will be made available for use by the broad scientific community. Users will identify applications that can be co-designed with a rapid cycle of system upgrades, resulting in the transition of ideas that are still in the early conceptual stages into prototypes that are in level of readiness that they can be handed off to the private sector.

The NQVL is envisioned as having three components, though only the Design and Implementation phases of the first component below are the focus of this solicitation:

NQVL:QSTD – Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration projects. These projects will make up the scientific and engineering core of the activities that combine to form a federated NQVL infrastructure and are expected to pass through three phases: Pilot, Design, and Implementation. Given the project nature of the NQVL:QSTD activity it is expected that the participants will proceed through all three project development phases as listed in the eligibility requirements.
Each NQVL:QSTD project is expected to define a quantum advantage goal and a projected pathway for achieving that goal. It is expected that this pathway will have a focus on the design and integration of quantum systems co-designed with applications developed by the full spectrum of diverse talent of the user community. Through this process of systems design and prototyping, the project will connect the underlying basic scientific knowledge to an application that is identified by this end-user community and fostered by direct interactions between these users, the systems engineers, and the basic science developers. Those activities will be complemented by appropriately scaled education and workforce development plans for training diverse talent in the quantum workforce.

NQVL:TAQS – NSF aims to provide resources to support research and development of enabling technologies identified by the NQVL:QSTD projects as they mature through the various phases. NSF envisions doing this through the mechanism of the Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS) program as an independent funding opportunity that will address critical needs of the NQVL infrastructure as well as contribute to expanding the access to the Laboratory to a wider community.
NQVL:Central – NQVL Planning and Coordination. NSF anticipates support for one NQVL Central Hub that will perform three distinct functions: i) promote collaboration and networking between the NQVL project teams; ii) promote engagement with the broad QISE community, partnerships with others and outreach activities to the general public; and iii) facilitate community oversight and the development of success metrics and benchmarks. The first function will enable the identification and potential exchange of component parts among the teams, especially in the Implementation phase. The other two functions recognize the need for greater accountability to the wider QISE community and to the public.
As such, NQVL:Central will be called upon to serve as the intellectual hub for the growing QISE academic community. The NQVL Central Hub will also facilitate connections between the units of the NQVL and the activities of other agencies as well as establish mechanisms for industrial participation in the QSTD goals. The NQVL Central Hub will connect with the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) and professional societies whose membership includes existing and potential practitioners in QISE. The NQVL Central Hub will host workshops and scientific programs that foster connections and dissemination throughout the QISE community. Lastly, the NQVL Central Hub will be asked to develop and maintain a Strategic Plan for NQVL investments, a living community document designed to keep abreast with evolving trends in the field, progress toward community goals, management and coordination, and implementation of new directions.

The development of the NQVL is expected to take place over several years. The present solicitation concerns only the Design and Implementation phases of the QSTD project components of the NQVL. Separate solicitations will be issued for the other components of NQVL, depending on the progress in the QSTD phases. At every QSTD project development phase, it is critical to keep in mind the full project development as described below while formulating plans, especially as many of the general requirements will apply to each phase. Support for the QSTD-enabling technology development part of the NQVL program will be on an as-needed basis as the subject of future NSF funding opportunities.

The NQVL program is intended as a national, community-driven effort that supports the smooth integration and translation from fundamental science and engineering to use-inspired applications. Building on the continued and sustained support of fundamental research from existing NSF programs, the NQVL will draw together expertise and talent from a broad range of disciplines to enable the creation and application of functional quantum devices and systems. Coordination will be provided through a federated infrastructure that serves much like a laboratory, but without the physical co-location of all assets and infrastructure, to identify roles and resource needs and establish mechanisms to enable all members of this virtual laboratory to communicate and function together as one coordinated unit. The federated NQVL structure, which will be developed and led by the community, should enable anyone to become engaged and contribute to advances in QISE.

II. Program Description
Note: The full NQVL program is being implemented in multiple iterations, each with its own solicitation. The present solicitation applies only to the Design and Implementation phases of the Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) component. The full scope across all three phases of this component is outlined here to help prospective proposers decide on the scale and scope of their proposals to this solicitation within the context of anticipated future goals for the entire program.

The Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects form the scientific and technological core efforts the NQVL is designed to enable. Each QSTD project will have identified a technology goal that has the potential for demonstrating quantum advantage that could lead to translation in the near term. Each project will also have identified a potential pathway for achieving this goal, including the basic science from which the pathway derives, the participants and skill-sets critical for the success of the project, and the user community that will derive the benefit. The phase-wise development that is planned for each project recognizes that this is a fluid process. Plans proposed at the beginning will have to be modified as detailed design and then implementation proceeds. Challenges are to be expected and must be addressed in the time allowed. Additional members with special expertise may need to be included to address these gaps. Feedback from potential users may suggest modifications necessary to deliver a useful end product. And systems engineering steps along the way may dictate changes and/or suggest improvements that speed up the process. The NQVL infrastructure provides the framework through which these changes can be implemented smoothly and quickly. In addition, the NQVL infrastructure will foster essential collaboration, coordination, and cooperation between the various QSTD projects, which might have a different technology focus. This will help identify gaps that apply to more than just a single project, thus magnifying the impact of developments along the way. Activities in areas of common interest or capabilities that benefit more than one QSTD project may be supported separately to maximize synergies and optimize resource allocations. It is also possible that these supporting developments could in turn lead to their own applications independently of the quantum advantage goal. Support for the acquisition or development and implementation of research infrastructure may also be included. The QSTD projects will also develop effective strategies for education and workforce development.

The QSTD projects fall into the category of long-duration NSF investments that require substantial funding over multiple award cycles. They are expected to be developed in three phases: Pilot, Design, and Implementation. Each phase will evolve into the next as the projects are refined and increasingly focused on prototype development and future translation.

1. The Pilot phase is focused on the development of the conceptual design of the QSTD project. Completion of the Pilot phase is required for submission to the Design and Implementation phases. By the conclusion of the Pilot phase, the team will be expected to have completed the following:

Refine the science questions;
Define requirements and prioritize research objectives;
Identify enabling technologies and risks;
Identify critical partnerships and dependencies;
Develop top-down cost and contingency estimates;
Formulate initial risk assessment;
Draft initial Project Execution Plan; and
Draft initial Education and Workforce Development Plan.
Conceptual Design Review: Nine (9) months into the project, NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Pilot project. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Design phase of the QSTD development process.

The Pilot phase is complete when a package containing the QSTD Conceptual Design and the QISE Strategic Plan on the QSTD topic, together with the draft Project Execution Plan and Education and Workforce Development plan leading to a QSTD Preliminary Design, is received and reviewed by NSF.

2. The Design phase is focused on the preliminary design development of the QSTD project.

The NQVL program recommendation for advancement from the Pilot to the Design phase is required for a proposal submission to the QSTD:Design phase.

A successful Design proposal will incorporate the QSTD preliminary project design, demonstrate technical readiness, and include planning for the total anticipated QSTD project lifetime. Design proposals must also include an appropriately scaled Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed, the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary, the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element, and the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation. A resource-loaded schedule may also be required to support the proposed QSTD system integration funding profile. Projection of implementation costs should be revisited in an updated plan for the implementation component of the QSTD project. The Design phase may take up to two years at a cost of up to $2,000,000 per year.

Specifically, the team will:

Develop enabling technology;
Update risk analysis, develop risk mitigation strategies;
Develop bottom-up cost and contingency estimates;
Develop preliminary operations cost;
Develop Project Management Control System;
Develop preliminary Project Execution Plan;
Develop preliminary Education and Workforce Development Plan; and
Identify key staff.
NSF requires that each Design team includes a professional Project Manager as part of the project leadership.

Preliminary Design Review: Nine (9) months into the project, NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Design project. The purpose of the review will be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Implementation phase of the QSTD development process. The site visit will focus on the technical and project management review of the Design project.

The Design project is eligible for a second year of NSF support. Therefore, a second site visit panel review may be conducted twelve (12) months later.

The Design phase is complete when a package containing the QSTD Preliminary Design, together with the draft Project Execution Plan, Education and Workforce Development plan, and funding request leading to a QSTD Final Design, is received and reviewed by NSF.

3. The Implementation phase includes the final design of the first-generation QSTD system, followed by the system integration and subsequent operations of this initial prototype, while at the same time pursuing the development of the enabling technology for the next-generation QSTD system.

The NQVL program recommendation for advancement from the Design to the Implementation phase is required for a proposal submission to the QSTD:Implementation phase.

The Implementation phase includes two components: first-generation design completion, assembly, and operations (Gen-1) and next-generation technology development (Gen-n). The Gen-1 component will proceed in two stages, locking in the final design (Final Design stage), followed by developing the first prototype and assembling and enabling the first users, or operations (Operations stage). It is expected that the subsequent Gen-n phase will proceed simultaneously with the Operations stage as the developers build off the experience gained with actual use, as envisioned in the co-design approach.

For the Final Design stage, the QSTD proposal demonstrates that the enabling research and technology development for the first-generation QSTD system integration project is completed, and that bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed. The QSTD system integration budget estimate for the first-generation QSTD is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.) Key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration. Commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed. The largest and most complex projects are encouraged to use appropriately scaled Earned Value Management reporting during system integration and should prepare an Earned Value Management System during this phase in readiness for system integration.

During the Final Design stage, with a duration of two years, the team will:

Harden key technologies;
Refine bottom-up cost and contingency estimates;
Finalize risk assessment and mitigation plan;
Finalize Project Management plan;
Develop Project Execution Plan (PEP);
Finalize Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP); and
Complete recruitment of key staff.
During the Final Design stage, the team may have Monthly Oversight meetings with NSF program staff. The team may be required to submit Intermediate Reports monthly via Research.gov.

Final Design Review: NSF will conduct a site visit panel review of each Implementation project eighteen (18) months into the award period. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team, provide feedback, and evaluate the readiness of the team to advance to the Operations stage of the QSTD Implementation phase.

The NQVL program recommendation is required for advancement from the Final Design stage to the Operations stage of the QSTD:Implementation phase.

During the Operations stage, the team activities will focus on:

System integration, testing, commissioning of the QSTD;
Operations and user support once a QSTD system is accepted by NSF; and
Development of the technology needed for and design for the next-generation QSTD.
During all activities in the Implementation phase, the team may have Monthly Oversight meetings with NSF program staff. The team will be required to submit Intermediate Reports quarterly via Research.gov.

NSF may conduct annual site visit panel reviews of each QSTD:Implementation project in the Operations stage. The purpose of the review would be to assess the progress made by the team and provide feedback.

QSTD awards for projects in the Implementation phase will be in the form of cooperative agreements that contain terms and conditions specific to the nature and risks associated with the project.

Each phase of the QSTD projects will follow on the previous phase and constitutes the next step in the refinement of the project. At each phase proposals will be invited only from those teams, or combinations thereof, who have participated in the previous phase. The Implementation phase can be expected to last for six years, with a possibility of one renewal, at a cost between $7,000,000 and $10,000,000 per year.

The following language applies to the technical review of all phases of all QSTD projects:

Scientific Review
Proposals are considered first based on their science goals and their potential of translation from laboratory to practice. Given the significant resources required to execute a QSTD project and the fact that a QSTD project will extend for more than a single award cycle, the scientific goals and the specific outcomes must be compelling and clearly articulated in the proposal. NSF proposal review panels will conduct a comparative review of all proposals submitted to the NQVL program in a given fiscal year. The review panels may be asked to consider the programmatic balance of investments across the full NQVL program.

Technical and Project Management Review
The feasibility of the proposed activities will be reviewed thoroughly. Given the scale and complexity of most large NSF investments a separate panel may assess the implementation plans outlined in the proposal. As QSTD proposals will likely include acquisition, technology development or fabrication activities, the proposal review may consider technical readiness, risk mitigation, project management plans, budgets, and schedules. For long-duration projects with a lifetime possibly exceeding a single award period, contingent on selection in a subsequent development phase, the technical review may also consider performance schedules and the planning for the total anticipated number of system integration and development cycles in the QSTD project, including possible operations. For renewal proposals, the record of success in achieving any previous set of milestones will be taken into consideration. As needed, these reviews may involve site visits. In all cases, the technical review panel will be asked to consider and provide guidance to the Program on the appropriate duration of the award and milestones needed to evaluate progress.

Education and Workforce Development Plan Review
The NQVL program seeks to identify and promote effective education and workforce development strategies that promote input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent in QISE thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. All three phases of the QSTD project development process, i.e. the Conceptual, Preliminary, and the Final Designs of the QSTD project, are required to include appropriately scaled education and workforce development plans for training diverse talent in the workforce in QISE. Examples of activities as part of the Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP) may include, but are not limited to: i) QISE-centric curricula (K through Graduate level); ii) opportunities for students to interact with industry partners, for example through collaboration on research projects, internships, fellowships or entrepreneurial activities; iii) effective and evidence based educational approaches leading to development of skilled and diverse talent in the QISE workforce through formal and informal education; or iv) up-skilling and re-skilling working professionals. A dedicated E&WDP review will be conducted at each stage of the QSTD project development process. The E&WDP implementation will be reviewed annually once the QSTD:Implementation project reaches the Operations stage. The Education and Workforce Development Plan is intended as a living document that will be updated as needed.

Award Oversight
QSTD awards beyond the Pilot phase will be made through cooperative agreements that contain terms and conditions specific to the nature and risks associated with the project. These may involve site visits or mid-term reviews, and NSF approval of changes in management or schedule. Oversight will include monitoring progress towards any milestones established during the technical review. The duration of support will be determined based on the scientific goals of the project with input from the technical review and will consider the financial burden on the NQVL program. Proposals for continued support may involve both scientific and technical review, as appropriate at the time of the proposal submission. Appropriate close-out should be planned. For the largest investments a close-out phase may be described in the cooperative agreement.

General Review Criteria

All QSTD proposals will be evaluated using the NSF merit review criteria concerning intellectual merit and broader impacts, as well as an assessment as to how well the proposed QSTD project will address the stated science goals and QSTD impacts. Consideration of all QSTD projects begins by evaluating and prioritizing the science goals within the NQVL, and by determining the feasibility of the implementation plan. For each of the relevant phases – Pilot, Design, and Implementation – the associated deliverables from the previous phase will be reviewed before advancing on to the next phase. At each phase of development, the NSF may choose to provide support through the next phase or end its involvement. At successive development phases, the reviews will be increasingly more detailed and will involve an increasing level of commitment from the NSF. Project planning must take into account the total project lifetime. The NSF investment in any one QSTD project is of finite duration.

NSF has as one of its over-arching principles the fostering of diverse talent across the scientific community. All QSTD proposals submitted through any of the solicitations issued as part of the NQVL program will be required to identify steps that will be taken to promote this goal and can expect to be reviewed as to how well this is being addressed.

Review of the QSTD proposal and subsequent oversight of QSTP awards will scale with the size and complexity of the proposed project as described in the 2021 Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) NSF 21-107, or subsequent revisions in effect at time of proposal submission found at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp. Prospective PIs are strongly encouraged to familiarize with Chapter 5 of the Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) for guidance on planning and oversight requirements relevant to QSTD projects. The guidelines listed here follow standard practices for activities of this scope.

The Design and Implementation phases of a QSTD project will be conducted in the following sequence:

Design phase: NSF aims to support up to eight (8) Design projects with a duration of up to two years, at the level of up to $2,000,000 per year. The number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress.

Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. Advancing from the QSTD:Pilot to the QSTD:Design phase, the Lead Organization and the Lead PI may change subject to the eligibility limits on number of proposals per organization and per PI or co-PI stated in this solicitation.

The QSTD Pilot teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other and synergies are strongly encouraged. Following upon a clear and agreed-upon understanding of goals and objectives, the selection of a Lead Organization, and approval by the NSF to advance from the Pilot to the Design phase, QSTD Pilot teams may choose to consolidate prior to submitting a QSTD Design proposal to advance to the Design phase.

Implementation phase: NSF aims to support up to six (6) Implementation projects with a duration of six years. The level of NSF support for QSTD Implementation projects will scale with the complexity of the QSTD project but is expected to range between $7,000,000 to $10,000,000 per project per year. The number of awards will depend on the quality of the proposals and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress. The QSTD Implementation projects are eligible for a one-time six-year renewal, contingent upon the quality of a new proposal and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress.

Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. Advancing from the QSTD:Design to the QSTD:Implementation phase, the Lead Organization and the Lead PI may change subject to the eligibility limits on number of proposals per organization and per PI or co-PI stated in this solicitation.

The QSTD Design teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other and synergies are strongly encouraged. Following upon a clear and agreed-upon understanding of goals and objectives, the selection of a Lead Organization, and approval by the NSF to advance from the Design to the Implementation phase, QSTD Design teams may choose to consolidate prior to submitting a QSTD Implementation proposal to advance to the Implementation phase.

NSF requires that the leadership of each Implementation team separates roles and responsibilities with respect to the scientific and project management components of the QSTD project. The Project Manager will be solely in charge of delivering each QSTD generation on time and on budget.

Each QSTD Implementation team will maintain the QISE Strategic Plans on the specific topic of the QSTD project. QISE community town hall meetings may be convened at annual intervals. Specific details may be project dependent and will be captured in the QSTD Community Outreach plan with the overarching goal of fostering an open scientific dialogue and ensuring the broad participation of the entire QISE community.

As indicated above, the QSTD Implementation teams are expected to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate with each other. Synergies are strongly encouraged.

Letters of collaboration must follow the following format and be included in the Other Supplementary Documents section of the proposal:

"If the proposal submitted by Dr. [insert the full name of the Principal Investigator] entitled [insert the proposal title] is selected for funding by the NSF, it is our intent to collaborate and/or commit resources as detailed in the Project Description.

Specifically, our contributions to the project would include:

[followed by a succinct list]."

Departure from this format may result in the proposal being returned without review.

Letters of Membership

Letters of Membership in a scientific collaboration, identifying the individual to be a member of a formal collaboration operating under a set of collaboration bylaws, to be sent by the collaboration's spokesperson or equivalent also are allowed. They must follow this single-sentence format and be included in the Other Supplementary Documents section of the proposal:

"The [Name of PI's Organization] group is a member in good standing of the [Name of Collaboration], including Dr. [insert the full name of the Principal Investigator] as a member of that group."

Departure from this format may result in the proposal being returned without review.

Data Management and Sharing Plan

In addition to the PAPPG requirements regarding the management and sharing of data products resulting from NQVL activities, and in alignment with the National Science and Technology Council report on "Guidance for Implementing National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33)" and the National Security Memorandum 10 (NSM-10), NQVL proposals should also include in the Data Management and Sharing Plan a description of how any proprietary information or intellectual property will be managed. This description may include a discussion of how data will be shared with project partners and affiliates, how access to the data will be managed, and how the sensitivity of various data sets will be assessed. Research security concerns are relevant for NQVL projects because quantum technologies have the potential to impact U.S. economic and national security interests.

Collaborators and Other Affiliations Information

PIs should carefully follow the instructions regarding preparation of the Collaborators and Other Affiliations (COA) form provided at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/coa.jsp. A COA form in .xlsx format only must be submitted as a Single Copy Document for each individual identified as senior/key personnel of the QSTD team. For large collaborations or authorships, the form should only list those people with whom the senior/key personnel have collaborated in a direct and substantive way. Senior/key personnel with questions regarding whom they should list in their COA form should contact the cognizant NQVL Program Officer(s). Note in this context that listing a collaboration name or providing a collaboration URL is not sufficient.

Proposals that deviate from the required elements of this solicitation (or other items listed in the PAPPG) may be returned without review.

Additional Information for QSTD Proposals

PIs are reminded that the goal of the NQVL program is to accelerate progress towards demonstrations of practical quantum advantage, using a convergent, systems engineering, and co-design approach. The Program is committed to supporting use-inspired scientific research and technology development for the benefit of the national economy and to strengthen the Nation's strategic, scientific, and technological preeminence.

PIs are required to contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) at National Quantum Virtual Laboratory, telephone: 703-292-8235 or email: NQVL@nsf.gov as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, in order to determine the level of readiness for submission to the appropriate QSTD phase as well as the appropriate structure of the QSTD proposal in terms of possible supplementary documents and/or page-limit extensions.

PIs should consult Chapter 5 of the Research Infrastructure Guide (RIG) for guidance on planning and oversight requirements relevant to QSTD projects.

QSTD proposals must clearly describe:

What: QSTD vision describing the specific Science and/or Technology area that is the focus of the translation to be supported under the NQVL program and who might be the potential users.
Why: Scientific and technology challenges that can be addressed effectively only by a QSTD project.
How: Plan of activities to address technical challenges.
Who: Team with the organizational, scientific, technical, and sociocultural skills, trusted and respected by the QISE community.
Readiness: Evidence that the QSTD project is feasible in the time and with the resources afforded by the NSF NQVL program.
Community: Plans for engaging the QISE community in the QSTD planning and execution, for fostering education and workforce development, and for promoting the full spectrum of diverse talent in the QISE community.
Partnerships: Dependencies. Synergies. Leverage other NQI-relevant investments by NSF or other U.S. Federal agencies. Public-private partnerships.
Management and Coordination: Roles and responsibilities of all senior/key personnel. Deliverables. Timeline. Milestones.
Outcomes.
Metrics of Success.
Additional Information for QSTD Design Proposals

At the Design phase, the proposal must contain the QSTD preliminary project design and include planning for the total anticipated QSTD project lifetime. Proposals must also include an appropriately scaled Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed, the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary, the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element, and the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation. A resource-loaded schedule may also be required to support the proposed QSTD system integration funding profile. Projection of operating costs should be revisited in an updated plan for the operations component of the QSTD project.

Additional Information for QSTD Implementation Proposals

At the Implementation phase, the QSTD proposal demonstrates that the enabling research and technology development for the first-generation QSTD system integration project is completed, and that bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed. The QSTD system integration budget estimate for the first-generation QSTD is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.) Key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration. Commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed. The largest and most complex projects are encouraged to use appropriately scaled Earned Value Management reporting during system integration and should prepare an Earned Value Management System during this phase in readiness for system integration.

VI. NSF Proposal Processing And Review Procedures
Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other persons outside NSF either as ad hoc reviewers, panelists, or both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals. Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.

A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/.

Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Leading the World in Discovery and Innovation, STEM Talent Development and the Delivery of Benefits from Research - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. These strategies are integrated in the program planning and implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, projects, and activities.

One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to foster integration of research and education through the programs, projects, and activities it supports at academic and research institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and learning.

NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, and activities it considers and supports.

A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria
The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and engineering research and education. To identify which projects to support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.

1. Merit Review Principles

These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic research and education, the following three principles apply:

All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.
NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.
Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.
With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level, PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs of those activities.

These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the criteria can better understand their intent.

2. Merit Review Criteria

All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.

The two merit review criteria are listed below. Both criteria are to be given full consideration during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i). contains additional information for use by proposers in development of the Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.D.2.d(i), prior to the review of a proposal.

When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria:

Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and
Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.
The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:

What is the potential for the proposed activity to
Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and
Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?
To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?
Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan incorporate a mechanism to assess success?
How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?
Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed activities?
Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review the Data Management and Sharing Plan and the Mentoring Plan, as appropriate.

Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria

Design phase: The NSF proposal review at this phase will focus on project-related aspects such as budgets and project management, and will evaluate, as appropriate to this level:

the preliminary Project Execution Plan (PEP) describing how the project will be managed;
the scope of work in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) format along with a WBS dictionary;
the budget estimate and basis of estimate for each WBS element;
the risk or uncertainty in the budget estimate accompanied by the methodology for risk and budget contingency estimation; and
the preliminary Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP).
The Program may seek additional reviews to evaluate the technical scope and costs at a level commensurate with preliminary design.

Implementation phase: The NSF proposal review at this phase will focus on reliability of cost estimates and technical readiness, as evidenced by the following:

the QSTD:Implementation proposal demonstrates that enabling research and technology development is completed;
any bid packages for major contracts or acquisitions have been completed;
the QSTD system integration budget estimate is refined so that it is based substantially on externally provided information rather than internal engineering estimates (vendor quotes, budgetary estimates, etc.);
key staff members needed to manage project activities are recruited and ready to commence system integration;
commitments from external partners in the activity are confirmed; and
the final Education and Workforce Development Plan (E&WDP) is satisfactory.
The Program may seek additional reviews to evaluate the technical scope and costs at a level commensurate with final design.

B. Review and Selection Process
Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.

Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a recommendation.

After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell proposers whether their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from new recipients may require additional review and processing time. The time interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts upon the Program Officer's recommendation.

After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and Agreements or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support for review of business, financial, and policy implications. After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer does so at their own risk.

Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases, reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline funding.

VII. Award Administration Information
A. Notification of the Award
Notification of the award is made to the submitting organization by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer. Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)

B. Award Conditions
An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.

*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-8134 or by e-mail from nsfpubs@nsf.gov.

More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.

Administrative and National Policy Requirements

Build America, Buy America

As expressed in Executive Order 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers (86 FR 7475), it is the policy of the executive branch to use terms and conditions of Federal financial assistance awards to maximize, consistent with law, the use of goods, products, and materials produced in, and services offered in, the United States.

Consistent with the requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act (Pub. L. 117-58, Division G, Title IX, Subtitle A, November 15, 2021), no funding made available through this funding opportunity may be obligated for infrastructure projects under an award unless all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials used in the project are produced in the United States. For additional information, visit NSF's Build America, Buy America webpage.

C. Reporting Requirements
For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a final annual project report, and a project outcomes report for the general public.

Failure to provide the required annual or final annual project reports, or the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of required data.

PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual and final annual project reports. Such reports provide information on accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted by the PI.

More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and other important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained in the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg.

About The National Science Foundation
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering."

NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.

NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative research between universities and industry, US participation in international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational activities at every academic level.

Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide Chapter II.F.7 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.
