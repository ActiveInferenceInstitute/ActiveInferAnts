        # John Templeton Foundation: A Comprehensive Overview

## History and Mission

Founded in 1987 by Sir John Templeton, a renowned investor and philanthropist, the John Templeton Foundation has become a pivotal force in funding interdisciplinary research and fostering conversations that inspire awe and wonder. Sir John, who began his career on Wall Street in 1937, was known for his contrarian thinking and investment acumen. His passion for understanding value eventually broadened to encompass fields like theology and philanthropy.

The Foundation's mission reflects Sir John's belief in the importance of open-minded research and progress in spiritual understanding. Their motto, "How little we know, how eager to learn," encapsulates this approach and drives their commitment to exploring life's biggest questions.

## Funding Areas and Scope

The John Templeton Foundation funds work across a diverse range of subjects, including:

1. Science and the big questions
2. Character virtue development
3. Individual freedom and free markets
4. Genetics
5. Voluntary family planning
6. Gifted education
7. Life sciences
8. Human sciences

The Foundation is particularly interested in projects that explore the intersection of science, philosophy, and theology. They support research that addresses "big questions" about natural and social sciences, philosophy, freedom, and world religions.

## Grant Application and Selection Process

The Foundation welcomes funding requests from anyone, including charitable entities operating both inside and outside the United States. The grant selection process is rigorous, with only about one-third of applications making the cut. When considering proposals, the Foundation applies its "Theory of Change" questions, evaluating:

- How things will be different as a result of the grant
- The potential for enduring impact
- Alignment with the Foundation's mission and values

## Notable Initiatives

### The Templeton Prize

An annual award exceeding the value of the Nobel Prize, honoring individuals whose achievements explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind's place within it. Past recipients include Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and scientists like Freeman Dyson and Martin Rees.

### Interdisciplinary Research

The Foundation supports work that bridges fields like science and religion, as well as emerging areas like positive psychology. This includes funding for:

- Research on the nature of consciousness
- Studies on the origins of life and the universe
- Explorations of human flourishing and well-being

### Global Impact

Funding projects worldwide, from Tibetan Buddhist monks studying science to Harvard astronomers uncovering mysterious objects in the universe. The Foundation's reach extends to over 35 countries, engaging with all major faith traditions.

## Financial Impact and Global Reach

- Annual grant distribution: Approximately $150 million
- Assets: Over $3.4 billion (as of 2017)
- Ranking: Among the 25th largest grantmaking foundations in the United States
- International grants: One of the top ten funders in the U.S. by number of international grants
- European funding: Top funder in Western Europe from 2011 to 2015 by number of grants (544 grants totaling approximately $81.8 million)

## Philosophy and Approach

The Foundation's approach is characterized by:

1. Encouraging civil discourse between science and religion
2. Supporting work that explores life's spiritual dimensions
3. Focusing on themes such as creativity, curiosity, gratitude, purpose, and wisdom
4. Aiming to inspire awe and wonder about the universe and human existence
5. Promoting the understanding of what it means to live a life full of purpose and meaning

The Foundation aims to foster humility, open-mindedness, and curiosity in its approach to funding and research, continuing Sir John Templeton's legacy of intellectual exploration.

## Recent Developments and Future Direction

### Record-Breaking Application Cycle

In 2023, the Foundation received a record 3,109 requests for $2.3 billion in funding, the largest number of applications ever received for a single cycle. These requests came from applicants located in 120 different countries, reflecting the Foundation's global reach and impact.

### Organizational Changes

The Foundation has recently undergone some structural changes:

- Elimination of the "Philosophy and Theology" department
- Creation of a new funding area called "Religion, Science, and Society," combining work previously supported by three separate departments: Human Sciences; Philosophy and Theology; and Culture and Global Perspectives

### Future Focus Areas

Looking ahead, the Foundation aims to continue identifying research areas with the potential to make meaningful and practical differences in individuals' and communities' lives. Some of their current focus areas include:

- Establishing a robust science of love
- Launching a global study of human flourishing
- Probing the deep nature of time
- Exploring the fundamental nature of reality and consciousness
- Investigating the origins of life and the universe

## Conclusion

The John Templeton Foundation stands out as a unique funding agency that bridges the gap between scientific inquiry and spiritual understanding. Its interdisciplinary approach and focus on big questions about human existence and the universe continue to shape research and discourse across various fields. By fostering a spirit of open-minded inquiry and supporting innovative research, the Foundation plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the world and our place in it.
