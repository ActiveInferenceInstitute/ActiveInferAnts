Inês Hipólito ~ Active Inference Insights 004 ~ Markov Blankets, Modularity, Enactivism

welcome everybody to the fourth episode of active inference insights I'm your host Daris Pary Wayne and today I have
the pleasure of Hosting inz hippolito inz is a lecture of philosophy of artificial intelligence and mqu
University in Australia our research focuses on 4E cognition which holds that cognition is embodied embedded enacted
and extended beyond the brain and she studies how this framework can help us understand and build other systems that
exhibit a form of augmented Mission including brain computer interfaces neurot Technologies and smart
environments in addition to this she co-founded the international Society of the philosophy of the Sciences of the
mind with gutier picini and she is currently the ethics uh ethics advisor
um in artificial intelligence versus the cognitive Computing company which
implements active inference into artificial intelligence agents um inz
thank you so much for joining me it's an absolute pleasure thank you so much for having me uh the pleasure is mine and
it's um we were just discussing off a that you know we're doing this across
many oceans so Nez is in Australia I'm in London um but we managed to sync it up which is which is fantastic exent so
I wanted to start with markof blankets um all things start with Mar
Markov blankets um Mark of blankets really play a fundamental role in active
and in the framework that we apply to artificial intelligence to cognition more generally and also just the
underlying physics and math of back to inference and a lot of your work has focused on Mark of blankets and the
scaling up of Mark of blankets so maybe a good place to start for our audience would be if you could just give a simple
overview of exactly what a mark of blanket is and then we can go from that yeah fantastic uh yeah you're absolutely
right when you say that everything starts with the mark of blanket everything that is a thing um is has got
a mark of blanket and that does not necessarily mean um that a mark of
blanket is going to correspond to a certain kind of like physical boundary that one can see uh right a mark of
blanket um is a theoretical formal construct that what it does is it tells
you um how or what things are going to be influencing a certain state to be the
case right so it's it is a statistical Tool uh precisely to understand
something really important uh which is how a certain thing is coupled with
within or with its environment um so everything does start everything has its
markco blanket does start with the markco blanket because it is a way in which we can
capture two very important aspects um and these two aspects um are that um a
thing um typically an open system as the thing um is um both thermodynamically
open and operationally closed so this is quite crucial um because it is what
allows the thing um to persist not to perish not to succumb to the second law
of Thermodynamics so Mark of blanket is really become uh very useful because to
my understanding um they allow us to capture simultaneously these two
features being both operationally open oh sorry operationally closed and
thermodynamically open because what happens is the system is situated in the environment in a way that it is open to
the environment it must be coupled with the environment otherwise it is uh perishing um it will not maintain itself
but it also has a certain boundary that allows it to maintain its coherent for
so the markco blankets become really interesting because they allow us to capture those two dimensions of um an
open system and what is an open system an open system is mostly everything that we see uh we don't really come across uh
closed systems excellent yeah that's great um I'm wondering whether you could give us
a sort of overview of exactly how that coupling works so people may have seen that the mark of blanket is essentially
composed of active States and sensory States um that makes sense if yet if
we're talking kind of about physical boundaries like actuators arms legs and so on but on the understanding The Mark
of blanket is a statistical entity what does um what what what
really are active States and sensory States um in the theoretical way well
there are many ways to answer this question um it will depend on how much you want to connect um then the active
inference framework and formalism uh with other uh theories that we find in
physics or in Neuroscience uh so there are many different ways in which one can
answer um this question um but for the sake of remaining um with the kind of
like more scale-free application of markco blankets and not reducing to
immediately uh to the brain um I will uh keep the formalism as something that we
can apply to understand the statistical relations or
influences um between a system an open system and its environment um right so
then what you have is you have the possibility of understanding how a
certain system is in a particular state so you understand that and then and then
what you can also understand is you can make predictions about future States in which you may find the system by virtue
of using this kind of for formulas right uh so then what you have is you employ
or Define that the level or aspects um of scientific interest are going to be
your internal States right and then your next question is going to be okay how do
I find this system in this PR in this precise uh time and space in these
particular States what are the the the the states uh in which the system is
situated that are going to be crucial for me to find the system in this
particular State and therefore I understand um the system and potentially ideally I can make some uh nice
predictions about future States so this will be our internal States so then what
we need to we need to get on is then we need to get to Define what are the external States and those are like I
said the states that are going to be influential uh for immediately influential for um the system to be in a
specific kind of like internal States now this is all done the next step is to
understand that internal and external States they mutually influence one
another that's what it means about something being an open system right is that there is exchange of mattera and
energy such that the system is remaining in a certain State and for example is
not um going into into a face space um uh such as like perishing or or towards
um towards uh death um so then um what what you get is an understanding of um
what I was just saying which is how the system is coupled and in this permanent
um continuous exchange of matter and energy in order to remain
alive and push back on the second LA themodynamics right so you get this
operationally closed and open system at the same time that is uh very well captured by these internal and external
States and I did say that uh they influence one another but it is important um to
understand that they do not directly influence one another they need a second set of States um so basically internal
and external states are conditionally in opin it and they will require the intervention of a second um set of
states which is very much what you asked uh the active and sensory States right
so these are going to be the ones that are doing the direct communication if
you will between each other where um hopefully and ideally we have um a
balanced influence between sensory and active States right and these um direct
influences between um sensory and active states are going to play a crucial role
in order for us to mathematically trap down and understand the coupling of the
system in the environment which is the system being internal States the environment being external States so
this is just like the overview of uh the mark of blanket and the active inference
formalism that we could apply to anything that is an open system wonderful yeah that's great
that's a really useful explication of the framework um I think it's as I kind
of hinted to in my initial question it's it's rather easy to think of it as a physical boundary so we can think of
cell boundaries or the blood Bane barrier or the boundaries of my body and
then when we do that the notion of sense reactive States really becomes intuitive
in the sense that in the case of my body all it is is an action perception Loop and that's being known to be critical to
intelligence or cognition for a very long time so that said there's also a very strong
position which is that it's actually just a statistical description of the way things act the way things persist
through time that leads me to ask the question of should we consider the markco blanket to be in uh interpreted
in an instrumentalist way in the sense that it's kind of a way it's a tool that we can use in modeling objects open
systems or is it or should we be inter in it in a realistic way I.E there is
actually something uh that is ontologically a mark of blanket that is
truly out there as a markco blanket um embedded within lots of other markco
blankets of course yes I'm really glad that you ask that uh question it's a Live question um and um there are many
ways to answer um this question so the way that I that I that I that I decided
to answer the previous question was was in a way that one understands that um a
mark of blanket is a tool is a statistical tool it's a formalism it's a
mathematical construct right and I also did not go immediately
into the brain uh or an organism with actions and Sensations because I'm
trying to avoid uh precisely um the literature that tends to reduce the
framework to thinking that active States and sensory states are going to be
action and sensation right that is not the case right um so a mark of blanket formalism
from active inference can be applyed to anything that is an open system and there are many um examples of this in
the literature such as for example I can think of um the example of when you have
a set of um of pendulums in a room or a set of clocks in the same room what's
going to happen is uh that eventually they will synchronize right and you can use this framework to capture to predict
that synchronization right so it is important to understand that this is a mathematical construct that you can
employ to precisely understand patterns of behavior in the natural world right
so we've done that um we understood that so then we can think about it you can
use this uh framework to develop for example simulation models which allow you to understand the phenomenon of
scientific interest as well as hopefully it's a good model is going to give you some prediction power over future states
of the thing which doesn't have to be uh anything to do with cognition can be something um uh that is situated in the
natural world right then a certain phenomenon happens specifically in
cognitive science when we notice that specifically in cognitive science even
if you apply a certain computational framework doesn't have to be active
inference a certain computational framework is applied to model simulate
for ex and get some predictive power about for example black holes let's say
black holes right uh and they use that kind of like mathematical framework and then you employ the same
kind of mathematical framework the same kind of like ationalism to understand the brain because after all both a black
hole and uh a brain are complex systems what does that mean it means that it is
extremely difficult for us to model it why is it extremely difficult to model it because it is very high in dimension
so it's really hard for us we don't have the computational power to to model it which is why we need to incorporate
something called uh dimensionality reduction because we don't have the tractability to to Pro precisely do that
now keeping up with what what I was saying in cognitive science specifically a phenomenon happens so
imagine this we use the same computational um strategy to model
things from the natural world all the way to the brain right and then what
happens is that we would never say that the brain had sorry that the the the
black hole or something that is not uh part of uh a living system would have uh
specifically a mark of blanket or would engage in literally active inference we
would understand very clearly that this is computational strategy that we are developing and employing for epistemic
purposes to understand the phenomenon and to get some predictive power that's
what we're doing and we are happy with it if we get some predictive power that's success in science and then one once we do this
move and apply exactly the same formalisms into for example the brain or an organism right we tend to
anthropomorphize it right so we tend to say okay so then the brain is acting
precisely literally by engaging in active inference or in other uh Realms
engaging in predictive coding right so we lose track of understanding that okay
these were the tools that we started off with and we were very happy when we were modeling black holes with these tools we
were happy that we had some predictive power but now it's not enough we won't more well now we want to go from The
epistemic Virtue into an ontological predictor now we want to say that the
thing that we are modeling trying to understand developing um uh models for
epistemic gain is precisely has the properties or the ontological properties
that the model the computational model has right and that's when you get into
making a realist or taking a realist stance on and upon active influence
right you don't have to you can do it but then you're going to have to defend
that position in a way that okay you're going to have to answer so if you are if
you are applying the question that you need to answer then is if you're applying exactly the same framework to
model and predict black holes that you want to do the same with
brains do you get to say that brains engage literally in active inference in
ways that black holes don't and why so that's the realism take and the problems
that you find and what where you would uh be led to or you remain in the more
cautious kind of position which is on the instrumentalist or non-realist position in which case the position is
that all things in the world with with with the real existence right and those things
behave in ways that we would develop models to understand that behavior in
terms of patterns patterns of behavior the things exist in themselves
they interact with the world in themselves the patterns of behavior are
our scientific constructs so then we talk and then we can start talking about okay so I can
pattern behavior through for example employing developing a model on the
basis of Maco blankets active inference and then I pattern the behavior what did
I did what I did was I found patterns and therefore an explanation for a
Behavior Uh and this explanation is something that I didn't have before right right right right well I'm going
to take us towards some realist position now because I think people will find it interesting about the
the ontological claims ontological implications uh that act of inference has especially within the cognitive
science and the Neuroscience community and I guess when you're taking a real stance on the Markov blanket that there
are these structures which have some kind of um embedded nature in the brain right and and people have probably heard
frisen talk about how this is actually reflected in the phen phenotypic nature of the brain and its
hierarchies um it makes me think about modularity so mod it for people who
don't know was introduced by Jerry Fodor um in 1983 and the basic idea is that modules
are these kind of um innate neural structures which have kind of very specific functions and fdor in 83 laid
out sort of certain category certain functions that they a modular system
would have to um you know would have to obey by so domain specificity the fact
that modules have to operate on a very specific type of input um there's also
informational encapsulation this idea that like at least how he portrayed it in 1983 that these modules are
encapsulated with respect to high orderer beliefs that that notion got sort of you
know weakened over time let's say and then there were further about the actual neural architecture would have to be
involved in mod uh modules but anyway people can get the basic idea um of a module we might have a visual
module a hearing module a module for language right which would yeah which is
idea clearly taken up um or that tronsky found a lot of joy in um all that to say
what does active influence have to say about this picture of the Mind as being modular to any interesting degree and
does this notion of kind of at least for predictive coding position position a
hierarchy in which you have feedback loops in which the top down affects the bot the top layers affect the bottom
layers and vice versa does that actually really have anything to say about modularity and more generally the
architecture of the brain yes um well I'm really glad that you you're taking us there we do have um a couple of
papers that do um engage a little bit with uh the modularity of the Mind one
of them is Mark of blankets in the brain and that paper and the the one is parcels and particles um and um in there
we do briefly mention um reasons why thinking uh or patterning
the the brain Behavior the brain activity in terms of markco blankets would be useful for many reasons uh for
for for for applications that go all the way to DCM uh dynamical caal modeling in in Neuro Imaging but I'm going to set
that to the side and I'm going to specifically speak to uh the modularity of the mind you very well said um the
modularity of the mind is is one of the is one of those um theories that we've
been having in philosophy of mind that has been very foundational for cognitive science and for the ways in which we ask
questions for the ways in which we look for things in the brain um and has been
uh as influential as it has been refuted uh so very few people today I can think
of three people people uh that would endorse good old school fodorian modularity of the mind and there are re
there are philosophical reasons for that and there are scientific reasons for that philosophically uh there's been
made very substantial solid strong arguments against it and uh
scientifically um evidence shows neuroplasticity shows neural reuse in
ways that would contradict uh the modularity of the mind I will make here
just a recting of a little bit of history of philosophy of mind just um
before I get into U the active inference um understanding of um cognitive SLB
brain um activity and Dynamics just to say that it's interesting to see that we have this tendency so I'll do a little
bit of philosophy of Mind here we have been having this tendency in philosophy of mind or at least analytic philosophy
of mind um which is to look at and this is a point that has been made by many um
influential philosophers uh for example Francis Egan um she has made this very uh clever point and I
think she's absolutely right when uh we look into World philosophers of Mind look into what is happening in computer
science and then we adopt the best computer science at the time to
establish a kind of like a metaphor to how the mind supposedly work at the time
as you said in 83 uh Jerry F looked at um uh touring machines and in he and he
asked the question what would happen if one would conceive the mind as if it
were a touring machine and then he writes the book right what happened is
that what starts off as being like sort of like metaphorical thinking right it
eventually starts becoming a very ontological uh claim that the mind is
ontologically modular and that is very um it's very important for us to look
back in history so that we know what to do and what not to do in the future right because what happens is then you
set off cognitive science to look for those modules in the brain as you set up experiments as you set up uh uh uh
simulations computational simulations you set off to look for and find those very um then you have all of those sets
of properties that are supposed to be the model so there's the automaticity there's the domain specificity there's
there's the information encapsulation there's the top down information oh sorry uh the B
information going all the way up to cognition cognition mean so all of that framework that was a theoretical
framework adopted from computer science then is defining the whole cognitive
science field and what we should look for right so it's quite interesting and important for us to know our history to
know how things really happen in a way that well you look back and and you see how how it then science came back and
said well it kind of actually doesn't make sense that the mind is modular in that way uh so not only philosophically
we have refuted it and very u in ways that we have forced the modularity of
the mind to reinvent itself to revise itself to survive really and what
happened was um because the problems were coming to arise from philosophy and from from from Neuroscience what
happened was we started having to revise the modularity of the mind because the noveles were coming up but we did not
want to let go of the modularity of the mind so we start revising the basic pillars and then we start having to let
go of basic pillars and that's when you have massive modularity by petas for example and still um challenges continue
to come up right so then you start going into this other uh this other field
which was known at the time um cognitive penetrability so now what you allow is
you you you you revise modularity to the point that it's not just bottom up information going up but now you will
allow for bottom up and top down that's cognitive penetrability right and then it comes up um around
2010 and stays until 2020 still is a little bit here because as we um sort of
like um explored a little bit in a in a in a special issue that we we we just had out um this year with Michael kof
it's a special issue in Consciousness and cognition and it's about uh the bean brain and how whether how or whether uh
the visian brain predictive coding is compatible to the modularity of the mind
and specifically to uh the one that allows the this traffic going up and
down um such as uh cognitive penetrability and there are still um a
few people that um very are very engaged um in defending that kind of um of
modularity of the mind that is um quite um agreeable and comp comptible with
predictive coding and examples of that are for example more conservative um uh
approaches within U predictive processing theories of the mind for example the predictive mind prediction
error minimization uh mostly developed uh and headed by um by yakob Hui um that
would be one that um you can find as as as having some agreement with with
modularity of the mind of course the revised version of it which is uh the one in which uh it
is it allows traffic to go up and down and that's of course you can see the parallel as it being predictions coming
down prediction errors coming up and the traffic being very contentful in nature
therefore you have a version that it has got this compatibility between modularity of the mind and um and um and
the the predictive uh brain what happens is and I'll just wrap this up and go um
then to active inference what happened there if you think about it is you let
go of two things that were very precious for Jerry fer you let go of horizontal
boundaries and vertical boundaries and once you let go of that you really have to ask the question what is left of the
modularity of the Mind why should we keep it in place at all whatsoever right because what happened was you let go of
one there was the basic pillar of of the modularity of the mind which was the
boundary that was a distinguishing or dividing uh cognition on top and modules
at the bottom right this boundary doesn't you don't have this boundary anymore because now you have predictions coming down so you let go of this
boundary so Jerry doesn't get that and they have the vertical boundaries as well which
were very precious because those were about information encapsulation such that different modules are the main
specific and they do not talk to each other right so what you is you get rid of those vertical boundaries there's
there's an interesting there's an interesting historical point there um that just sorry to interrupt but this is
an interesting there there's an interesting chronology here which I actually learned during my undergrad where when I was looking at whether the
language comprehension was fundamentally modular so it was related that's hence why I brought up n jsky in 83 fodal has
very distinct definitions of information encapsulation and Dom specificity so do specificity is actually what we just
spoke about that there's a proprietary database that each module works on right so visual the visual module work on uh
photons or whatever you know or the language module works on syntactic
nodes and information informational encapsulation in 83 was top down beliefs
expectations doesn't affect the workings of those modules interestingly in in
2000s so he he writes another book or or article about modularity in the year
2000 he kind of conflicts and again I don't want to speak ill of Jerry fodo he's very important and he's also not
here anymore so he can't defend himself but he seems to confuse information encapsulation with dom specificity
because he talks about like this is a quote that a system is encaps a module is encapsulated if it's restrict if it
function is restricted to what its proprietary database contains so I think what's interesting there is factly what
you're were talking about in terms of horizontality and verticality kind of abandons the verticality there right he
wants to uh yeah he he abandons the verticality in the sense that by by sort
of a mission he concedes that maybe we should let go of this idea that top- down beliefs expectations don't
influence lower levels he does keep the um the horizont horizontality which is
let's keep these as distinct systems working on discrete um languages or data
for ones of a better ter so so it's just an interesting historical fact there that I think if he was H frodel might um
he could obviously offer some clarification but may also go back on his original 83 position of top down um
the the restriction for top down information to flow into modules yes absolutely and um I think that this is
also how you are absolutely right um in in in specifically the point about the
conflation between information and caps olation and the main specificity these are two different things and one of the things that are
that one of the aspects that I think would would need to be abandoned and that we abandoned in our Mark of
blankets in the brain is precisely that notion of information right so because you can
have domain specificity without relying on this notion of information encapsulation and things not conversing
with each other because again to my perspective that is anthropomorphizing the brain and brain activ ity right
we're talking about Dynamics and activities of the biology kind in the
brain and there is an anthropomorphization uh that I don't think it's necessary and again it proved
itself unnecessary right um so um but but we learn so much from from learning the
history of where these ideas come from and they have a place of course U and I think it's important for us to precisely
learn where they come from such that we start um improving and advancing our
understanding of uh the brain and cognition in different ways so there is
definitely place for for for Jerry Fodor um and I think that this is the place is
to get us into other other other uh advancements in the field and what um
what we have been able to to to to to see and uh through scientific evidence
in in in neuroscience precisely that that kind of way of thinking that may
have started as a metaphor doesn't really hold right and that there may be
um domain specificity I think you put it in a very nice way there may be domain
specificity without it being information encapsulation right and once you start
having to let go of all of these basic pillars of modularity it's gone we can
try to salvage it and then call it something and brand it something else but it's gone and that's when then you
also see in the history well we have now new um computational uh capacity or
strategy such as parallel distributed processing what shall we do let's try to apply the same thing that we did which
is what if we would think about the mind as if it were a parallel distributed processing system and then you have the
networks and predictive processing theor start rising up on the base of that analogy as well I am careful about going
over and abond and above the anal the it being a metaphor right because I always
think about the brain as a very biological kind of system as opposed to
a full agent with full capacities that thinks and reasons and models as if it were a scientist so I push back on that
I'm careful about that so the way from that position on then the way in which we theorize Mark of blank blanket is
being useful was you start from those understandings that the brain is a dynamical complex
system right that it changes over time that the ways in which
a full agent engages with the environment is going to have
significant impacts on the ways in which pathways are strengthened or are
weakened in the ways in which the brain is going to develop itself as an organ right
so you start from that very neurobiology kind of understanding of the brain that it is a complex system
meaning that it is a coupled system it is situated in a body it is situated within other organs uh in in in the
organism and this organism is situated in the environment right so we we we completely abandon the view of the brain
as being a predictive machine there even though you can and there's lit chore on
building upon the idea of the brain which of the brain being a predictive machine which comes from from Helm holds
and more recently you can theorize it and I've been um I've been presenting on that as you you can theorize it as the
low road or the high road to active inference which we can talk about later but the view is you can take that
pathway that's not the one that we took uh we took the pathway of the very neurobiology uh kind of way of the brain
being a highly situated organ within a larger system the larger system being
situated in an environment and all of these influences and interactions are
going to have an effect on the state that you're going to find the brain in a specific uh uh um point in time and
space so so then um starting from that understanding as opposed to the brain
being a a machine uh right so then we ask the question of whether or not uh
because this is what this is crucial this is the crucial point which is why I started by by describing mark of blink
is is this scientific construct that you can apply skill free comes skill free uh
that you can apply to anything that is a thing there is an open system you can apply it you can also apply it to the
brains but then you once you do that you have to test it out right you have to look into okay does this really make
sense can we find patterns of activity that would be explainable
through the application of Mark of blankets at different levels of
organization within the brain itself so then in that particular paper what we did was we we are we start from a
standpoint where we reject the modularity of the mind because we do not think that there are reasons scientific
reasons to think that the the the the the brain is
organized in very strict rigid ways call it modules whatever we want to call it
but in very strict rigid ways we do not think that that's the case because there is scientific reason not to take that
path and the Brain being a very Dynamic and changing um system then the question
that you have is how do we make sense of it right how do we find patterns in such
a dynamical system in such a coupled system how do we find those patterns can
we find those patterns so then let's apply this um uh Mark of blanket formulas
at different levels given the data that we have coming from DCM coming from
dynamical causal modeling of the brain so basically um in very very simple terms The View here is that we put the
brains in Scanners we get data out of the scanner and then we look at that and
just vast data the comic sense of it Con and start to think about how to make sense of that you employ DCM as a model
to make sense of that data and what you would get get from that is a nice causal topology about how um uh uh how
connections are made and Dynamics are formed so you get a nice pattern of that
if the model is is is is suitable and useful then you that's what you get so then from that kind of like um
scientific um point we we we grab all of that all of those nice models uh from
DCM and we see we look at whether or not we could apply the mark of blanket
formalism so the four the two sets of States um internal and external active
and sensory States in order to uh get an explanation of those pattern Dynamics at
different scales so we start off with the the scale of a single neuron and
then we have a cical column and then we have regions right and what is the what
is the the the take on message from this because of course if if anybody's interested uh in the details then the
paper is out there um but what is the take on message there is that we do find
the same patterns of behavior across scales by virtue of employing this uh
formalism and that is that is really good that's already quite um quite quite quite important because that means that
you can get what we started off our conversation with you can get um
understandings of activity that is occurring in the brain at different
scales where uh each of those scales is both operationally closed and
thermodynamically open so then what you get is you let completely go of that
rigid systems that you had with the modularity of the mind you completely let go of that and what you get is an
understanding of how um certain neurons in in in specific um environments you
can think about it in a very simple way as like a cell in a Cell tissue how a cell in a Cell tissue is interacting and
engaging with the tissue in order to do what it needs to do um so you can think
about you can use this formalism to precisely understand how that particular
system is behaving according to the environment that it is at so then you find these patterns of behaviors of like
certain neurons firing given certain um conditions and then you get all this
nice understanding of discou Behavior being situated that is highly Dynamic
and it really is dependent on the environment that it is situated at what
you also realize is that there are certain parts of the brain there are
certain specific parts of the brain um that you can see that they may be
insulated that they they they do not um conform to um active inference they do
not exchange um and that's in a way if you wanted to say that would be what Jerry F
had in mind as a modularity of the mind you could say that but all that happens there is a very simple bi biology
process which is the system already knows what to do without needing to know
what is going on in the environment it is what we say as it is set by Evolution
it works so it's been working so well that way that it doesn't need to know or get to know feedback from its
environment right so those would be the ones in which you would say oh it's encapsulated but it's informationally
encapsulated I wouldn't say so right right right right yeah there's a lot of that there's a lot of that um
cool I mean it I you also gave a really nice um description of for cognitive
science there so exactly as I said in my introduction um the four e for those who
can't remember embodied extended see if I remember enacted extended you get all
of them yeah um and I'm enjoying the history lesson as well so um because I
do as as you said I think the chronology is really important here just to get a picture of the philosophical foundations on which this work is being done but
eight years after Jerry Fodor releases the modularity of the Mind the very important book comes out which is the
embodied mind of Raa Thompson and rash before we go there because you work I
guess within that framework of as you said for cognitive science the embodied mind I think listeners will be curious
about you you mentioned scientific evidence refuting uh
modularity I just wondering if you could provide this maybe just with one example of a module which is not exhibiting the
typical um the typical features that Fodor laid out which would make it fundamentally modular so what what makes
it open let's say to its environment yeah one very clear example comes from the all the research in neural reuse so
that would itself already um sort of like move us away or it's it's I would
say it's it's strong reasons to move away from that rigidity of modules that
are do not change that are um as Jerry fod would conceive of it they are
hardwired in that way so another feature that you lose is the automaticity right
so the idea with the auto automaticity is that modules in a way are silly right
they don't know really what's going on they are hardwired to automatically process the information that they domain
specific to right so that's the automat automaticity they don't really have a
say in the meta so to speak um even though I'm completely anop anthropomorph
ing this story as as one would with the modularity of the mind uh so you you do
lose that um with with with the the the large evidence on on on um on neural
reuse where you see um which is extremely compelling and it it's
absolutely fascinating that you see certain neurons that we used to be
neurons for vision to become neurons for something else like like odit Tre system
for example depending on the necessity of the whole overall
system so what you see is the neural reuse um uh cases where well it really
it really challenges the basic aspects or properties that would make a module a
module right don't make domain specific or is it domain specific if it becomes the main specific to something else uh
the automaticity um as well so the the the the neural reuse um I think would be
a it's it's a great challenge um another one is of course neuroplasticity so the
studies in neuroplasticity do um challenge again the rigidity of uh the
the the the the non changeability of this hardwired um system yeah absolutely
okay great that's really useful yeah yeah I always think about um I think I got to about the murk effect when I was
learning about modularity of mind which is this auditory visual illusion that when people yeah people can search
up or do the murk effect but again that that brings into question um this encapsulated idea that muls can't speak
to each other okay excellent well as I said what became very popular uh after
these kinds of rigid computational accounts of the Mind was an activist
embodied models following verel Thompson and rush and verel was of course a
biologist and so um and he introduced the term aesis which kind of means this self
organization that we now speak of or self- evidencing um before 1991 so so as
you were saying we are inclined now to look at the brain as a biotic thing as a
biological system and this is very much uh for grounded in um embodied cognition
maybe it would be useful for everyone if we could just go through the four e
firstly um it doesn't it doesn't have to be super it's a very rich history um so I'm you know as long as short as is
suitable but maybe we could go yeah one by one and think about where is the
evidence or where is he philosophy or as the intuition that this is true um and
we can start I guess with the the first one which is embodiment what what does embodiment mean and kind of what is the
research around the embodied brain what what does it focus on what does does it Center on all right very very good um so
um embodiment is um something that is is a concept that comes from phenomenology
um from the existentialist Philosophy from phenomenology it's a very rich uh
concept and it is fundamental to understand a lot of confusion in the
field because we need just we need to distinguish between weak and strong embodiment I will call strong embodiment
the one that comes from chology and existentialist philosophy such as the one that for example Sim B had in mind
the body that one has that grounds our experience of the world that's the kind of embodiment from SIM
or um and um then within the E Frameworks uh within the E framework you
have different theories and while they do agree with let's say a couple of um
principles they are going to disagree age with within certain more nuanced
aspects of their own theories and I think the embodiment is one that is mostly useful for us to understand the
State of Affairs in the field and the theory and the confusions right so um
let's say that it is very reasonable to to think that most people in the field
of cognitive science today are not going to reject that the body plays a role to
understand the brain that the body plays a role to understand cognition very few people would disagree with this right
the followup question is how do you understand the body and I will get to that I will just say that only those
that would conceive of cognition as encapsulated in the brain as a computer
system such as the prediction error minimization accounts or for example
yakob who is kind of conservative account um that there he says very
clearly you can throw away the body the world and other people because the brain sufficiently as a machine takes care of
the cognitive business so that would be the only account that I know of that would not bring in the body to play a
fundamental role all other accounts do agree I think we have come to that
agreement that the body plays a fundamental role embodiment plays a fundamental role now the question the
follow-up question is how do conceive of embodiment and then you have two ways the weak and the strong weak embodiment
is the one that is endorsed for example by um predictive processing theories such as Andy Clark as the Visionary uh
behind it what happens there is that Andy Clark in his account invites the
body to play a causal role in cognition and this is important because also with the with the with the with the with the
body you can um interact with a world that is Technologic iCal where there are
things that then give you the extended mind but I'll I'll get to that if if we
have the time anyway so it's weak embodiment what does this mean this means that um cognition is a predictive
processing that takes place in the brain so this agrees with more conservative
predictive uh aor minimization accounts but not only in the brain predictions
but the prediction processing machine includes the body what does this mean
this means that the body is seen as part of the predictive machine the body is
seen as computational cognition is computational so that's why this is weak
embodiment so anic clar does not endorse the embodiment that MTI or Sim had in
mind he endorses a very computationalist kind of embodiment so this is why you
can kind of like to understand the E cognitive science you kind of have to spread it out within a range and then
you get like um you get like the more conservative ones and the more radical ones right the more conservative ones
are the ones that are going to say that cognition is computational the more
radical ones are going to say that cognition is not computation and then you have a spread out of of um of the
question that you can ask to help navigate the ecognition uh literature is
how radical do you want to be because if you want to say that cognition is computational you're not
radical at all right and radical doesn't have anything to do with original
radical just means how radical you are in comparison to Old theories such as
the the the computational theory of mind what is the computational theory of mind is everything we' been talking about with the modularity of the mind and
predictive processing theories this is all computational theory of Mind how radical are you in relation to the computational theory of Mind where are
the basic assumptions are to that cognition comes down to um uh
computational processes of information processing that's computational theory of mind and that the mark of the mental
is mental representation there would be more Nuance thing things to say but this would be two that you can ask yourself
and then you can ask how radical am I away from these two assumptions right so
that's the view and then you get like this weak embodiment which is very close to or if not it is um kind of like right
in the border between computational theory of mind and ecognition almost like shouldn't be there if you would
conceive that uh cognition within e the E umbrella is not computational right uh
so that's the very weak embodiment and then you have the strong embodiment which is any theory that explains
cognition by grounding cognition very much uh within the embodiment that the
experience that one has of the world of course here what we talking about is uh
the level of analysis and and understanding that uh people working in that field are looking at is um about
the full um agent that is situated in an
environment we are not talking about neurons of course we take that into consideration in the sense of the causal
relations that I mentioned before which is how is it that the experience of the world is going to aect effect and
influence the Bly biological processes and in there you also find the brain so
that's kind of like the strong embodiment from mopon H and all of that kind of thing uh that we have and mostly
applies to uh psych Psychotherapy and and and and psychological analysis and
then you get into um uh let's say in activism right and then in an activism
you find um different kinds again but let's say that both strong embodiment
and in activism they reject these two things they reject that cognition is a
computational process of information processing uh and they reject that the mark of the mental is mental
representation so they reject these two things right they reject in kind of like different ways but non not
non-compatible but they they they want to reject these two assumptions um so
the an activist um has different different ways um in which uh you can
also formulate of it um so you have the verela Thompson and rush so verela and
Matana uh starting the autopoetic um uh in
activism uh which is a very rich uh literature very based in in biology and
extremely compelling uh and very well formed um and then of course um others
more recently pick up on um autopoetic and activism and uh they have developed
more recently um the framework towards uh sense making uh in activism now I
want to just stop here to go to autois just to make the bridge with active inference where you can right where or
at least where I find that it's reasonable to make that breach um autoptic and activism um brings out and
a lot of recent work by an activists they also stress uh that out um they
bring out the understanding of crucial aspects of living systems from bacteria
to us um as having those two aspects as being thermodynamically open and as
being operationally closed and those two aspects Lounge the system into a state of precariousness so these are main
Concepts within theop poetic and activism and what this can then mean
that we can think of is that what does it mean for a system to be precarious well what it means is that the system
must must must interact with the environment in order to remain alive
what does this mean well this means that the system is coupled with the environment now again what does this
mean this means that the system the living being cannot be encapsulated from the environment what this would refute
is the conservative computationalist views that cognition comes down to being encapsulated in the brain and we can
throw away the body the world and other people so that's kind of like what this means so that's why the question is how
radical are you from The View that cognition comes down to computations in the brain right how radical are you so
we're making our way towards a more radical one and then once you find these ideas of like operationally closed
thermodynamically open therefore a state of precariousness therefore must be coupled otherwise it dies then you say
well this active inference framework actually captures that very nicely because I get conditional independency
from internal and external stat that would allow me to get the operationally closure but I also get the direct
influence of being thermodynamically open that comes from active and sensory States so then it really nicely captures
that state of precariousness as a tool so that's that's nice I think and then
you can um you can go as radical as you want which is to completely push back on
um any views or kinds of theories or ways of thinking that would bring out uh
cognition and cognitive systems from bacteria to more sophisticated inculturated systems like us um as um
being computational of any kind and this is something that I've been presenting as augmented cognition in the in the
sense of um the kinds of like computational models that we develop um and
mathematical thinkings that we develop they are our cultural PR practices right
so in that sense we developed these very sophisticated ways of making sense of
the natural world of which brains are part of living systems are part of right
we develop all of those very highly sophisticated systems and computational
um capacity um to make sense of the world around us and what I'm very very
careful is not to make that last step which would bring me back to the computational theory of mind to say that
those computational strategies are ontological predictors of what the brain
is of or or of what the living system is so I am very careful about that that
maybe put me in the very radical position because I reject all of the computational theory of mind uh view um
so that's how you kind of like make your way within the ecognition is by asking how radical are you in respect to to
computational the of mine excellent great um I think we have
two more e but we but we basically touched upon them um one is
embedded um and the next one is extended um do I give a brief absolutely word to
that absolutely so um the embedded one is the one that as I was spre spreading it out in range and I was saying that
well um you have here very close uh you have a bound with the computational
theory of mind and here you have the radical stuff so embedded is here close to the the the computational theory of
mind and this is the E that I mentioned before when I explained that um very few
people in com in cognitive science in the field would reject that the brain is
embedded in the body and the body is embedded in the environment very few people would reject that so that's the
embedded that's why this can be seen as almost close to the weak em embodiment
that's the embeddedness very few people would talk about encapsulation only with that exception
of the one that is the prediction rization by Yakov can throw away the world um and other PE the body and other
people so that's the embededness is just the claim that the body is the brain is
situated in the body the body is situated in the environment now then how you are going to explain that situatedness is where you are going to
fall in different ease in the strong embod in the different kinds of uh in activism
the radical in activism or the more sense making in activism um how you are going to explain that it's the
embeddedness is what's going to make the difference on our radical you go and then you have the extended which I
briefly mentioned um so the extended comes as a part of like a package uh
with um uh radical predictive processing by and Clark so the package is that um
it it is it is radical in uh relation and in comparison with prediction and
minimization um or conservative one it's radical in relation to that but it's not radical in relation to other eats so
what happens is that what you have is an understanding of cognition as being a computational process that takes place
where well not only in the brain but also in the body right the body plays a causal role for that information
processing predictive processing to occure and to happen uh in the ways that it does now it can also incorporate
objects tools from the environment that are going to play a causal role of the
same kind as um your body plays so then you have a whole system that is
distributed it's is a computational system we still talking about computational theory of mind it is a computational system that involves brain
body and tools and that's the extended mind great um and yeah I always feel the
need to kind of refer people to where these ideas come from so um extend of my hypothesis Clark and Chara's classic
paper um and definitely worth checking out I think when I hear uh these
stronger an activist or stronger for recognition um perspectives which refute
representation as the mark of the mental or Mark of cognition it makes me think
uh where does Consciousness fit into all of this because as a conscious
um you know subject uh being with a subjective start upon the world I you
know I I have some sympathy for the enti list view because I think it feeds into some intuitions that I can't like this
mind is privileged and can be divorced in some sense from the world upon which it does some computational work so if
really we we we take the privilege away from representation um
which which I think is also a kind of worm so we don't have to get into exactly what is a
representation but maybe we maybe we can go there um what's what's the kind of R
of qualia subjectivity intentionality and the kind of uh features of
Consciousness oh thank you for that question I always feel like when um when
we go that path um the mental representation being the mark of the mental um it feels like uh we are
getting to watch a TV show halfway through like in season two right because we don't ask the questions where the
representations and content comes from right so that's the hard problem of content so I know that we want to get
that because that would allow us because we already are in the place where we do
have me we can engage and develop and more and more every more sophisticated mental representations that what we are
that's what part of what we are doing here is engaging in ways in which we are involving and employing uh mental
representation such that we can understand each other right so it's like we're already half season halfway
through this through the TV show we are already like in season three um so but there was a beginning of the TV show
right well you didn't have any of this you as a baby as an infant could not be communicated with me in this way about
these things where does that come from that comes from something called inculturation right so I think before
before we start explaining things as if they were always like that we need to understand that there is a trajectory in
cognition in cognitive development that we shall not forget so all of those things had to be acquired unless you
want to defend nativism that that would be also could could be very close to Jerry F as well
because you already have these starter packs that you already have this very very much in place um Machinery that
would allow us you to have all of these sensory all of this semantic content already ready to use that you could
start making sense now if you reject folder you reject it all now you have to
answer the question how can we do this where does this come from you've rejected folder right so you have a
story to tell now the way that I I see it and many um in activists do see it uh
and by the way also very much compatible than with mathematical uh Frameworks of
dynamical and complex Theory um and that is that is employed in in in a lot of
psychology uh uh Empirical research as opposed to the computational theory of mind uh even though that's the
mainstreaming in cognitive psychology it's not the only one um and the way in
which you can think about it is that you um cognition the m so what I'll start by
saying this I've I've heard many times people ask me but how is it possible
that there's cognition but there is no no mental representations no one is saying that so that's not a claim that's
not a claim from an activist an activist an activists don't say that there aren mental representations what they tell
what they want to tell you is that mental representations do not come for free you are not born with them you had
to do things in the environment in order to acquire them you have to to develop
it as a skill so we give you a story about a hard problem of content where does that come from when it does not
come as within the nice starter pack that cherry foder or decart would tell
you that it comes from so once you get rid of that you have a story to tell and the story is that it depends on
inculturation so basically as you start as an infant as a baby we we come into
the world and we start interacting with the world this world is and this is the key point this world is already social
it's already a social cultural setting there is no baby that is born and is developing within a setting that is not
social already so it is in the ways in which the baby interacts with the their
caregivers that the parents are the caregivers and the world around them
that is going to gradually allow them to build um simpler um Concepts simple ways
of using Concepts and then scuff holding that into a a numerical system in a
conceptual framework and then later on in being able to engage in logical
thinking and reasoning and then being able to express some sophisticated ideas
and maybe even becoming a scientist and contribute to developing highly sophisticated computational models that
study black holes so it's an inculturated process of course as we are
here doing this interaction um what we are using is we are making the best use
of our most skilled to so far uh and I'm sure that um that will go keep going in
a in a in a a trajectory but our best skills of um explaining ideas and
discussing so we are using and making the best use of our best mental representations but I also have to say
that this interaction does not reduce to those U mental representations there is
an embodiment aspect of the situation that we are at a a very clear uh example
of that is that the interaction is different whether or not we are having the interaction in person or we are having the interaction online we'll make
things different because we don't share the same physical space so this is just an example of um how embodiment here
would play uh uh uh some some would play out but the idea is that eventually
you'll start developing the capacity to develop and engage in mental representations also as you talk to
other people and you make sense of the world around you okay cool um I'm going to play not
going to play Devil's Advocate but um and I also don't want to make you commit to any position nor am I asking you to
solve the hard problem of Consciousness because that's not that's not going to happen this also not the purpose of the
podcast but I understand in that sense that mental representations are kind of
Downstream on enacted behavior on social cultural norms right it they as you say
there's a lot of evidence to suggest that it's not some hardwired Chomsky and module right there we can take that as
kind of axiomatic I guess my question here is that kind of makes sense in terms of mental representations per se let's say
they develop out of this inactivist um way of being that we have what it
doesn't necessarily answer is the kind of characteristic features and the idiosyncratic features of
Consciousness so the actual like fundamental what it is like to be me
what it is like to be you to use Thomas Nagel's terms so I guess my question here is
um again not trying to pin you down I understand there's a lot of nuance here would the an activist be uh sort of
would they be attracted to the notion that Consciousness is epip phenomenal and by that I mean for people who don't
know epip phenomenal Consciousness is the idea that Consciousness is like the steam coming off a steam train so it's
caused by uh neural physiological Behavior but doesn't actually have any causal effect on those um on those
mechanisms so it happens it's there right and it kind of depends on what philosophy of Mind Theory you um
subscribe to but would they say that Consciousness has no causal role um I'm
imagining that there aren't many substance dualist in activists but what
what what kind of considerations have they made of the role of Consciousness right um so I I I'll just bring some
some something in so that so when we talk about qualia uh
epiphenomenalism um um and uh what it is like um like in the bat um what is like
to be a bad Thomas nle when we are or or the the hard problem of Consciousness when we talk about that we are within a
certain conceptual toolkit right we are already within what
wienstein would call a bottle a theory right and it's important to to to
understand that when we start making our way within a
theoretical path it's like we're building blocks of a house and then we getting a certain kind of house by
virtue of the the belief system thoughts that and the path that we are
doing that's the kind of like conceptual Machinery that you get once you play
that game so and by playing that game I'm here referring to or having in mind
viin Stein's language games so you can tell the story of or you can do the epistemology of
understanding uh how cognition comes around and about and works by playing
different games and that is the traditional analytic philosophy of Mind
Game and that game is very associated with the computational theory of mind so
what I'm trying to say here is that once you put on certain goggles there are certain things that you're going to see
and there are certain things that you cannot see so once you start on that path of
thinking Journey those are the problems that you're going to find those are the problems that like the hard problem of Consciousness is a problem that you're
going to find because then what you get is uh how do we study both the easy
problem and the hard problem so you necessarily when you start going in that direction you find those problems and
then you have the explanatory Gap that how we close the gap so these are problems that come up within the
computational theory thinking language game so those are the goggles right and of course we can try to make
these theories talk to each other but it's very important to understand that it's almost like axiomatic in the sense
that you start solving an equation in one way it the equation will look a
certain way you start solving the equation in a different way the equation will look in a in a different way right
so that's almost what we are talking about right because we are not starting
from the point in E cognition doesn't start from the point of view of the
brain in the other um more traditional computational theor of M of course it does so once you do start from the bra
brain being machine note what questions come up okay so if the brain is a machine then how is it that it gives
rise so it's a scaling up problem how is it that it gives a rise to Consciousness
how does this machine give rise to Consciousness because there are there is evidence that there's Consciousness that
is what it is like to be about there's qualia there's a hard problem of Consciousness this is within that kind
of thinking because you start by the brain being a machine and then you ask how do we get to the good stuff and then
you get all of that from within the more radical e cognitive science you don't
start from the brain being a machine that's the first thing you reject right and that's also in dynamical and complex
systems theory the case you have phenomenal work by Van Helder and other people that precisely reject that
cognition has anything to do of being anywhere or we should use any conceptual
uh any concept from a computational scientist perspective to Kit right so
then you don't start from there you start from the point of view that living systems are precarious and they engage
with the world to maintain themselves the brain is part of the story but you
don't start there right so in this engagement what happens is you have you
engage with the world because you have certain goals usually the goals have to do in a more minimalistic biology way is
that you don't want to die it's the precariousness of of pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics right so
you engage in the world for that reason because you want to remain alive typically this is the most basic biology
there's much more than that but let's just stay with that so then what happens is you start exploring the world and in
exploring the world you do that by exploring your body so that's when the body comes in as the body is the means
by which you have access and explore the world and respond to the world's and
invitations to exploration so it is in these interactions with the world that are extremely embodied and limited
they're both constrained and possible by the body that whatever you do it's
cognitive behavior and this cognitive behavior is what are the goods that we
want to understand in cognitive science and we do that by by explaining them
through patterns of behavior right so it's completely different
goggles yeah I I am going to push back because I think it's I think it's good it's not adversarial it's collaborative
um I I just sense or I just kind of believe that the Vicken styan relativism
has its has its limits right it has its points where you say well there are certain things that maybe aren't
relative in the language game and maybe one of those are the fundamental aspects
of my experience that I can attest to regardless of if I'm in a braid of
lat or if I'm an evil demon is tricking me right like unless I adopt some illusionism about Consciousness which
I'm not willing to do but again like it's not there there's not a viable position to do but I'm going to take it for granted that like even even radical
illusionists wouldn't say that qualia doesn't exist it's just not what we think it is and I'm think here Kei Frankish and den it so for me like the
Vick steinan relativism that qualia is itself part of a um Paradigm to use a
sort of term of Thomas [ __ ] or it's part of a boss or it's part theoric yes in the sense of the linguistic aspect of it
but the fundamental phenomenon is at least for what I can tell is real so
what is the alternative I guess is my question right yet I I I don't I'm not refuting the notion that a cognition is
in some way constrained and opened up impossibility by having a body by being embedded in the social context and so on
but we still have to GR in my opinion we still have to grasp with the fundamental
facts of phenomenal experience so I'm sorry if I sound like David Charmers and
David Charmers parrot but no it seems to me that like I can't get away from the
explanatory Gap and I don't think that that's a problem in my theoretical framing of the problem I think
that's because the phenomena phenomena associated with Consciousness is so radically different from anything else
in the physical Universe yeah and and there are very um I must say that there
are very good points that are made by David chalas in that respect that I that I uh very much um agree with
um now to go back to that and to link that in a way that would be um that
would be compatible within uh my view of an activism I would say that and also
wienstein um there is a real world that you don't
have access to so I completely agree with what you said right I completely agree uh that
there is a limit to relativism yes that's the limit the limit is the limits of my view I'm not going to say the
limits of my language as which I did in the first in the first book in trus because you overcame that so I'm just
going to um I'm going to dare to reformulate that for him and say the limits of my perspective are my world so
there's there there there are aspects of the world that I will not have access
to and that's just the way things are I will not have access to your experience of the world because and here's the
inactivist bit coming in because my experience
is determined by the set of past interactions that
I've had with the world and this moment right here where um this experience is
taking place and everything else outside of this I don't have access
to that's the bit in the Bo in in the box right so the the the idea is not the rejection
of other perspectives and that's precisely vien Stein's point is understanding understanding that there are it's the humility of understanding
that there are other perspectives in the world and you do not have access to them you only have access to your own uh very
um specific kind of perspective to the world now another thing that he adds that it may be uh useful um is to say
that for him these are seen in terms of aspects of the
world you see the world through the aspects that are made relevant to you
right here right now given what given your past experiences your past interactions of the world that's why
certain things will become Salient in this particular moment in the environment which connecting to the
other Theory you would call the what it is like to be me to what it is like see
I don't know if I would um the well to me I wouldn't right I
mean the the salience of my environment I completely agree is shaped by my body
it's shaped by my homeostatic requirements it's shaped by my sociocultural upbringing status and so
on but the fact of the matter is is that things we could describe things as being
Salient without necessarily invoking well that's a good question I guess whether we could invoke salience
of out Consciousness but I guess I I mean as a force experiment you can in a sense um I had John Vu on last
week and he was talking about relevance realization and so it's very sort of still fresh in my mind I said my my
reading of this would be that salience is just a manifestation of the conscious experience itself but are we going to
get any closer to the actual fundamental characteristics right like whether it's salience or visual perception or
auditory perception I mean like the Charmers problem is still there
right uh the Chara's problem is okay let's let me just go back to the initial thing because otherwise I'll lose it um
that you said um um the the note that the difference between the Frameworks is
quite it's quite this simple thing which is Things become relevant and Salient
and experienced in a certain way within ecognition because of the embodied
experiences that you've had in the past within a computational theory of mind you might say the same you might say
things are relevant what it is like to be me why well because of the way that
information has been process processed in the brain as a as a as a machine so these are different explanations for the
same kind of phenomenon they're diff they are completely different so this is where they are aart
right um now as to the problem of um the heart I think when you said Chara
problem you meant the heart problem of Consciousness right um y okay so it may
be the case and this is also a Vian sign move so I'm not going to take credit for that um uh it may be the case and this
is very in line with with David chers which is why I think there are certain features of it of of of chmer thinking
that I that I really like and agree with um vians makes this point not everything
that is there to be understood about the mind can be understood through the
scientific meod and this is the hard problem of consciousness that chmer talks about
right and and I think that he makes a good point there I think that he is very
um cever and very very correct and I completely agree with three points that
he makes which is that many people are falling up on the Trap of claiming to
study Consciousness and experience and a first person however you want to call it
depending on the theory you're coming from um embodiment if you like they claim to study embodiment and conscious
experience and all of those kind of like good things that really make us by going to the brain Alone by
studying easy stuff and that is a theoretical trap it's a fallacy and
that's where I really agree with with David charma's work which is why I'm doing what I'm doing in in ecognition
precisely because I do not want to get into that trap which I think it's it's a trap as well I agree with him great
wonderful well that's our that's our convergence point and again I it's it's it's not so much that we need to solve
the hard problem but I'm just curious about whether it retains its problematic nature in in for so that that that's
good to get some clarity on that I Rend I wonder just it it's it's a difficult
question but and again I'm not trying to get you to solve the whole problem I'm just curious about your thoughts on this
I said I had John Vu on last week and he's got this idea that getting more
precise on the f function of Consciousness would help us in resolving the nature of Consciousness
the hard problem do you see any viability in that
link you can get some something by the function if you within the Frameworks
that I work on active inference and activism right Within These Frameworks I'm going to give the answer within these Frameworks you can get some
explanatory traction you can get some um epistemic virtue out of thinking function but it doesn't get you all the
way through it gets you to understand the precariousness and why systems
behave in the way that they do it's because they the function is that they want to push back on the second law of
Thermodynamics they want to remain alive but then you think about a point that Simon DEA made which is also a very
clever point which is if all that is to life is to not to
perish then what is it that makes us different to vegetation right so function gives you
as much as it's interesting and relevant to the point that it explains or it
gives you as far as a cross life explanation so one thing that you get is
the function is all life does not want to die typically That's the Law that's
the that's the free energy principle that's all but it gets you as far as that and
you want more because you want to get to the goods of like uh embodied experience right why
people behaving the way that they do right so here I think
that you can bring in also again some on the above wise is is is I think is a
good segue into um making this point which is very under the E umbrella but I think she makes this point in in a way
that here is it's going to make the point um clearer which is that if if
again going back to the point if all that is to life is not to perish then what makes us different from vegetation
what makes us different from vation is that we are in um a kind of cognitive
development trajectory that we become enculturated we are situated in Social
cultural environments and once that happens we start behaving in ways that not only do
we get the conceptual toolkits the reasoning Etc but we also have access
and contribute and Co construct those social environments from the very
embodied situation that we are at so in a way the biological body constraints
the access and co-construction that you do with the world as well as the social culturally developed embodiment also
plays a role in the participation that you have or not have within the
environment that you navigate now she puts this in terms of uh the living being between it's it's
a condition between freedom and facticity which see how how compatible
this is with what we were saying about push pushing back on the on the second law of Thermodynamics you want to remain
alive but you don't want to remain alive within an encapsulated environment you want to remain alive and do really well
in a social cultural environment which is why we are more than simple vegetation that just wants to leave we
want to live well we want to live good we want to do things that are good for us so we start now entering the realm of
reasons like reasons that we need to give for the things that we do in the ways that we act right so now we start
to become very sophisticated start to get to this like uh mental representation if you will but it
doesn't come for free it's not a commodity we we now we start getting into like season 3 right which is like
things start to get like really interesting so then you can explain um embodied experience as being social
culturally situated that is dependent on the embodiment that you have and that
embodiment that you have is what is going to somehow determine where you are
navigating continuously between freedoms and facticity and she puts it even more
precisely between um agency and
objectification and then you start reasons to how you navigate the social cultural World wonderful yeah yeah it's
the first time I've had s b brought up in intive inference conversation but um
she that that's great uh yeah it's a wonderful segue actually into existentialism and phenomenology and and
we're big fans of mlo Ponte and haiger and draus on this on this podcast as well I thought what you said was
interesting which is that as you as you said correctly the free energy principle is a principle it's like hamiltonian
principle of least action right it's kind of a where it's it's a first principles ontological explanation of
just like what in the case of the FY principle what things have to do if they're going to continue through time
to persist but active inference um or in
certain cases predicted processing or in certain cases computational theories of mind or in certain cases it activat
theories mind are what we call Process theories so it's if we take the free agent principle just to be axiomatically
true in the sense that it's kind of and I think Carl would say this himself it
if you actually put it down to its nuts and bolt it doesn't say too much right it's things do what things have to do to
continue to be the things that they are really and there's a lot of fun maths but it's really about how it's
implemented in us or artificial intelligence or whatever it is um those process theories become
falsifiable so predicted processing might not be the right account of uh continuous St space um active inference
or um perhaps the mind is uh you know fundamentally Downstream on the body in
in a radically embodied way I guess because it's falsifiable um a question that came to
my mind when you were speaking um about activism is and the history as well of cognitive science is as you say there's
very few people who will adopt a radical computational um position these days
daycard John C for example but for cognitive science is very popular right
to put it simply can you envisage a future where for where future science and future
philosophy tell us that viewing the mind as embodied enacted embedded what was
the last one go on Wikipedia um yeah is not the
the right way to view it as we now look back on the computational picture and think it's incomplete yeah okay so I I'm going to
go back to the goggles um it it seems that the ways in so so science is built
on um on First Steps right on the goggles that you put and then you end up
with certain kinds of um theories that now you have and now what would I do
with this I test it I see if it makes sense right in with the case that it doesn't make sense uh we we we don't
know but it is about putting these goggles um and a lot of what is done still in in
cognitive psychology is very daycard is very starting in in season 3 in like
okay minds are mental representation so nobody cares about things that or about
experiments or setting up experiments or thinking or reasoning about how did it come to
be right where we we should put more effort on that how it came to be which
is what by the way dynamical in complex systems theory applied to psychology does that's all they do all they do is
to uh focus on the developmental trajectories to understand how they
evolve and develop how States change into um developing and evolving um and
and much of what is done in cognitive psychology is starting in season 3 is
the the mind is representational and now we got to find that not only in our
cognitive psychology experiments as we put as we as we design our experiments
right is with that assumption in place and that's why this is so dangerous it
may be the case that one is right to think that the mark of the mental is mental
representation but not criticizing it and not having a critical point of view about it what what it means is that
everything that we do within cognitive science science within setting up experiments within setting up
computational models simulations it's going to be starting with the assumption that the mark of the mental is mental
representation and that the brain is an information processing machine so this
is going to be defining for everything that we do and all that I'm saying is that let's take a step back and go to
the beginning of the series as opposed to starting in in in season three and question these things and if they still
make sense great we've done a very good job right so so that's that's the point
of view right and I think that what ecognition the more radical view does is
it takes away that those toys and puts you into okay when you have to start
from the very beginning what do you have and how do you build so it it it puts
things into into pressure on whether that is the case because when you do the bit of the
history of philosophy of mind and you realize that a lot of it has been done
by borrowing conceptual toolkits from computational science then you ask the question what is left for philosophy of
mind is there a philosophy of mind or is there a borrowing conceptual toolkit from computer
science now that is a that's a provocative question I'm not going to I'm not going to try and answer it it it
it's cool the way you talk about the the scientific theories it reminds me we had ma alberon as our second guest and
actually on the day of us calling this the podcast just came out so everyone should definitely go and watch it but we had a long chat about epistemic
communities and the kind of silos that people end up in and that's actually very much akin to what you were saying
that people can really end up stuck in their scientific Paradigm and I'm really hoping that doesn't happen to
me I think it's kind of happening already I mean it makes me think the my
my sort of um philosophy science is not as good as it should be and it should get better but I'm aware of Thomas C in
this idea of the Paradigm the way it sounds to me is that like I don't know I'm adopting a kind of more heelan
perspective where um you got the computational theory of the mind and in activism like radical in activism as
your thesis um and your sort of antithesis and you have this dialectical
relationship right and then what you might end up with is a symphysis and that might I don't know
it's a very broad question but do you see science unfolding in that
or is it kind of more of a incremental Pursuit towards a higher or or getting
closer to truth so um yeah you do have those two different paradigms and I would answer that in in in in in a in a
very clear way I think that all that we have in the computational theory of mind
is our human social culturally situated
experience as a human species best efforts to understand
a phenomenon in the natural world so we develop all this computational Machinery
strategies models Etc because we this is what makes us human we want to
understand the world around us and part of the world around us is human beings
right so then we we have all of that as a reflection or as telling or as a
manifestation of what we can do as a species when we come down to being
epistemic communities and these epistemic communities are and ma was
absolutely right are completely social culturally situated so uh science itself like our
own individual experience of the world does not occure in an encapsulated
manner we could aim for an ideal bird ey
view perspective of being doing science in a way that is completely objective but as
wienstein already told us we don't have that we cannot get out of the trajectory
that brought us here we cannot have access to that other perspective only our own and that is going to be biased
and overlooking that it's dangerous because one would claim that that that
is possible and that's not that's why our best our best um capacity as a human
species is these epistemic communities where we can exchange ideas test ideas
with each other give feedback to each other and improve each other's thinkings and um an experiment such that we
improve in a collective effort that is scientific wonderful I like that it's
spiriting I don't like the idea that we're just stepping on the the toes of our ancestors maybe they did have
something good to tell us and we can build together but maybe never get there because we're blinded in some sense I
mean um obviously where one cannot speak therefore one must be silent um in this
case we could go on forever um I do want to make it clear that your work is
incredibly Broad and diverse and touches on a wonderful range of things so we could have spoken about religion you
have a wonderful paper on religion from an act of inference perspective um autism among other things uh we didn't
even touch upon artificial intelligence agents um so there's going to have to be
around two I suppose it there's where can people find
your work what are you working on what have you got coming out where can people find you because I'm sure they'll want to know more about what you're doing
yeah just on my website that's usually what is updated um which is www. energy
poo.com so usually there you got the links to other places like Publications
Etc and on Twitter as well I'm usually active so anything that comes out uh any
uh conference that I'm organizing participating or papers that are out I always share them on on on my Twitter so
that's usually the places super great okay that's wonderful well it's half
past 11 UK p.m. so I need to need to dash off to bed but this has been an
absolute pleasure um it thank you so much for your time and yeah as I said we should definitely do this again oh thank
you so much what a terrific uh exciting uh uh conversation thank you so much and definitely up for round two well

B. Additional Overview Information
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the Army
Research Laboratory-Army Research Office (ARL-ARO) and the Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity (IARPA), is issued under paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR), and 10 USC 4001 which provides for the competitive selection of basic
research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are
considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision
of Public Law 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984” and subsequent
amendments.
The Department of Defense (DoD) agencies involved in this Program reserve the right to select for
award either all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to this announcement. The
participating DoD agencies will provide no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal
development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to
5
this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of participating DoD agencies to treat all proposals
as sensitive, competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of
evaluation.
This BAA makes frequent use of the terms “Offeror” and “Performer”. They are not
interchangeable. An Offeror is an entity who submits a proposal. Statements referring to Offeror
or Offerors are therefore directed at those preparing a proposal. A Performer designates an entity
engaged in Program work and provides here a useful point of view when describing expected
activities of the Program. Statements referring to Performer(s) are thus intended to inform Offerors
about the kinds and pace of work those engaged in the Program would be expected to undertake;
they are not intended to set or imply requirements for the proposal.
II. DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDING
OPPORTUNITY
A Funding Opportunity Description
1. Program Summary
The Rapid Explanation, Analysis, and Sourcing Online (REASON) Program aims to develop
technology that will enable intelligence analysts to substantially increase the quality of
argumentation in their analytic reports through more effective use of evidence and reasoning. In
the context of an analytic report, evidence is information that supports or opposes a judgment,
while reasoning is the stated justification for the judgment. Furthermore, strong reasoning is
reasoning that logically substantiates the judgments while weak reasoning is reasoning that either
fails to substantiate the judgments or contains logical flaws. The technology developed by the
REASON Program will automatically produce comments (feedback and recommendations) on a
draft report, highlighting additional relevant evidence, and identify strengths and weaknesses in
the draft’s reasoning. Analysts can use the comments to improve their reports.
Argumentation is central to the Intelligence Community (IC) Analytic Standards, which are listed
in Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 2031
. The standards are intended to guide IC analysis
and analytic production. The Analytic Tradecraft Standards focus on several aspects of evidence
and reasoning, including sourcing, explaining uncertainty, distinguishing between underlying
information and assumptions, and logical argumentation. Because evidence and reasoning are
crucial components of every analytic report, REASON will have broader application than previous
research efforts aimed at helping the IC make accurate forecasts.
Currently, intelligence analysts are encouraged to use structured analytic techniques to boost the
quality of argumentation in their reports.2,3
 Many of these methods require substantial additional
quantities of analysts’ time and are therefore not widely used. As contrasted with current
applications of structured analytic techniques, REASON technology will automatically produce
comments with no additional effort from analysts, who can use any comments they find valuable.
1 https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICD/ICD%20203%20Analytic%20Standards.pdf. 2 https://www.cia.gov/static/955180a45afe3f5013772c313b16face/Tradecraft-Primer-apr09.pdf 3 https://www.dia.mil/FOIA/FOIA-Electronic-Reading-Room/FileId/161442/
6
Some of these comments might be based on the automated application of effective structured
analytic techniques, along with additional innovations.
By making specific comments on draft analytic reports, REASON technology will fit into the
existing intelligence analysts’ workflow. The comments will be analogous to those made by
automated spelling and grammar checks, except that REASON’s comments will focus on
improving argumentation instead of writing.
Offerors shall address all three technical Task Areas (TAs) to meet REASON’s goal of developing
automated methods to produce comments on draft analytic reports that enable analysts to
substantially increase the report’s quality of argumentation:
• Task Area 1 (TA1) – Identify Additional Evidence: Automatically find relevant
supporting and contrary evidence in addition to the evidence used in a draft report.
• Task Area 2 (TA2) – Identify Reasoning Strengths and Weaknesses: Automatically
find strengths and weaknesses in the reasoning of a draft report.
• Task Area 3 (TA3) – Produce Comments to Increase Quality of Argumentation:
Based in part on the output of TA1 and TA2, automatically produce comments that enable
analysts to substantially improve the argumentation in their reports.
Offerors must propose novel approaches to each of these three TAs, and if selected as a Performer,
will be required to create an end-to-end technology that incorporates software components from
each TA. Developed capabilities must be compatible with a provided Application Programming
Interface (API) to facilitate assessment by independent test and evaluation (T&E) according to
program metrics described in Section II.A.7, Program Metrics.
2. Technical Challenges and Objectives
Offerors shall address the following technical challenges and objectives to meet the REASON
goals.
Identify Additional Evidence (TA1): The goal of TA1 is to develop technology that
automatically identifies additional supporting and contrary evidence when such evidence exists.
Successful approaches will produce, in response to a draft analytic report and a corpus of source
documents, a prioritized list of up to eight items of additional evidence contained in the corpus but
not mentioned in the draft report. (Only the first eight items will be scored). Performer systems
will need to determine whether a piece of information is relevant evidence bearing on the analytic
question addressed in the draft report and whether it is additional (non-redundant) to the
information used in the draft report. Performer systems should identify (where appropriate)
contrary as well as supporting evidence, determined by the relationship of the evidence to either
the draft’s conclusion or the evidence and reasoning within the draft. When there is no nonredundant additional evidence, performer systems should report that.
Identify Reasoning Strengths and Weaknesses (TA2): The goal of TA2 is to develop technology
that automatically finds strengths and weaknesses in the reasoning of a draft analytic report. This
means that the system will be able to identify reasoning elements in the draft report. For each draft 
7
report, the system will identify up to eight strengths and weaknesses. (Only the first eight items
will be scored). Each strength or weakness will point to the appropriate section of the draft report
and shall be accompanied by a brief explanation of why it is strong or weak reasoning. A successful
system must distinguish between apparent and real strengths and weaknesses in reasoning. If the
reasoning in the draft analytic report is sound, the system will report that.
Produce Comments to Increase Quality of Argumentation (TA3): The goal of TA3 is to
develop a software application that, with input from TA1 and TA2, automatically produces
comments on draft analytic reports that enable analysts to substantially increase the quality of
argumentation in the report. TA1 and TA2 provide evidence and reasoning improvement as inputs
to TA3, and TA3 builds on these to present useful comments to the analyst. Successful approaches
must identify key areas where a draft report can be improved and generate comments based on
those, presented in a manner that prompts analysts to use them effectively. The comments may
concern individual issues or the overall draft report, including the correctness of the conclusion or
the appropriateness of cited evidence; they may address the content or the communication of the
report’s argument.
The TA3 REASON application deliverable must be compatible with analyst authoring
applications, typically Microsoft Word. TA3 encompasses both the software development and the
research necessary to draw on TA1 and TA2 inputs and effectively communicate
recommendations to the analyst so that they improve the argumentation in their draft report. The
TA3 REASON application is the only portion of REASON that analysts will interact with.
REASON will provide comments to analysts in a timely manner once the analyst requests
them. There is no formal milestone for response time. However, delays in response times will
likely result in less use by test participants and intelligence analysts.
3. Program Phases
The REASON Program is a 42-month effort, comprising two phases. Proposers must submit to
both phases or else they will be considered to be non-compliant. Because the goal of the REASON
Program is to increase the quality of reports produced on classified systems, deliverables produced
by proposers must offer a minimum of Government Purpose Rights that grant the Government
intellectual property (IP) rights sufficient to allow the Government to modify and deploy
deliverables on classified networks.
In Phase 1 performer systems will be tested comprehensively on unclassified data consisting of
draft analytic reports and news reports. In parallel, the REASON independent T&E team will
retrain and evaluate performer systems on classified draft analytic reports and source reports. In
Phase 2 performer systems will be tested on classified data consisting of draft analytic reports and
classified source reports. In each phase performers will develop and be tested on techniques for
addressing TA1, TA2, and TA3. Each phase will contain several testing cycles; each cycle will
contain approximately 20 challenge problems consisting of an analytic question and a draft report.
Challenge problems will become increasingly difficult over the course of a phase.
In each phase TA1 will be evaluated by measuring the performer system’s ability to automatically
find and rank-order additional evidence. TA2 will be evaluated by measuring the performer 
8
system’s ability to automatically find and explain strengths and weaknesses in reasoning. TA3 will
be evaluated in two ways:
1. T&E raters will evaluate the comments produced by performer systems – on correctness,
appropriateness, and clarity.
2. Final Exam: Human participants will be assigned to use a performer system or to be in a
control group. Participants will produce draft reports on assigned analytic questions and
have opportunities to revise the reports. The same analytic questions will be posed to
experimental conditions using Performer systems and control conditions. The analytic
questions will be drawn from a wide variety of topic areas, including political, military,
social, economic, environmental, or diplomatic topics. The form in which the analytic
question is posed will vary and will emulate the type of taking that is given to IC analysts.
Participants assigned to a performer system will work for a set duration to produce a report.
During that time, each participant will see the comments that the system produces and may
use any of the comments in revising their report. T&E will measure the argumentative
quality of finished reports, comparing those produced with the aid of a performer system
to those produced by participants in control groups.
Phase 1
Phase 1 shall have a duration of 24 months. The goal of Phase 1 is to develop novel systems to
enable analysts working with unclassified data to produce analytic reports of substantially higher
quality. Performer research will focus on developing automated methods for processing
argumentation (evidence and reasoning) accurately, producing comments that human users find
explainable and helpful.
Performer systems’ TA1 and TA2 capabilities will be tested over three cycles each, where each
cycle includes both unclassified and classified testing. Cycles will become increasingly difficult
during the phase: it will become more challenging to find additional evidence and strengths and
weaknesses in the reasoning. Performer systems’ TA3 capabilities will be tested in one cycle (with
unclassified and classified testing) and one final exam using unclassified data. Each of the TA3
cycles will measure systems’ ability to produce comments that are correct, appropriate, and clear.
The final exam will measure the effect of the system’s automatically produced comments on the
quality of reports written by human users who produced the draft and can view the comments. The
human users will include undergraduate or graduate students in disciplines such as intelligence
analysis or international relations.
All Performer work will be unclassified. Performer systems will be tested by cleared T&E
personnel on classified data but Performers will not be able to review that classified data. T&E
will provide Performers with unclassified summary results from classified testing. In classified
testing, Performer systems, operated by cleared T&E personnel in an automated fashion, will need
to search, identify, and process textual documents containing classified data. These documents
will differ from the unclassified news and opinion documents in several ways. In addition to
containing new information, the classified data will have distinctive stylistic features, including
classification markings and IC-specific jargon and abbreviations. Some unclassified examples
with these stylistic features will be provided at Program Kickoff. 
9
Phase 2
Phase 2 shall have a duration of 18 months. The goal of Phase 2 is to refine the capabilities of the
methods developed in Phase 1 so that they function effectively on classified data and produce
substantially larger effects. Performers will refine their systems to process the content and style of
the IC’s source reports using unclassified examples, but they will not have access to classified
data. Performers will receive actionable summary level unclassified feedback from the
independent cleared T&E that they can use to refine the capabilities of their methods and systems.
Performer systems’ TA1 and TA2 capabilities will be tested over one cycle each. Performer
systems’ TA3 capabilities will be tested over two cycles and one final exam, using cleared
intelligence analysts as participants.
3. Recommended Team Expertise
Collaborative efforts and teaming among Offerors are highly encouraged. It is anticipated that
teams will be multidisciplinary and may include expertise in one or more of the disciplines listed
below. This list is included only to provide guidance for Offerors; satisfying all the areas of
technical expertise below is not a requirement for selection, and unconventional or innovative team
expertise may be needed based on the proposed research. Proposals should include a description
and the mix of skills and staffing that the Offeror determines will be necessary to carry out the
proposed research and achieve Program metrics.
• Applied epistemology
• Argumentation
• Cognitive psychology
• Experimental design
• Informal logic
• Judgment and decision making
• Linguistics
• Natural language processing
• Philosophy of language
• Psychometrics
• Rationality
• Software engineering
• Systems engineering
• Systems integration
4. Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals shall explicitly address all the following:
• Underlying Theory: Proposed strategies to meet Program-specified metrics must have
firm theoretical bases that are described with enough detail that reviewers will be able to
assess the viability of the approaches. Proposals shall properly describe and reference
previous work upon which their approach is founded. 
10
• R&D Approach: Proposals shall describe the technical approach to meeting Program
metrics.
• Technical Risks: Proposals shall identify technical risks and proposed mitigation
strategies for each.
• Software Development: Proposals shall describe the approach to software architecture
and integration.
The following areas of research are out of scope for the REASON Program:
• Purely automated production of analytic reports.
• Approaches that process non-textual inputs such as:
o Images
o Video
o Audio
o Structured data sources
o However, it is permissible to use textual clues (e.g., image captions) to locate and
retrieve non-textual items
• Approaches aimed at processing text in languages other than English.
• Approaches that require Performer access to classified information or data. All Performer
research will be strictly unclassified.
5. Program Data
The REASON program will use both data provided by the Government Team and data provided
by Performers. Proposals must specify the data needed to carry out the proposed research and what
data characteristics are necessary for the Proposer’s approach(es) to be successful at meeting
program objectives. These details should be provided for using Government-provided data as well
as Performer-provided data.
a. Government-Provided Data
The Government will obtain data as a corpus of source documents and make it available to
Performers via a T&E testbed. At the beginning of Phase 1 this will be a corpus of unclassified
news articles and analytic reports. At the beginning of each phase the Government team will also
provide access to a small sample of unclassified draft reports similar in form to the classified draft
reports that will be used in T&E testing in that phase.
The unclassified data provided by the Government for training and testing REASON systems is
intended to serve as a surrogate for the intelligence items that would be considered by an IC
analyst. For planning purposes, Performers may assume that this corpus of data will include at
least 25 years of output from at least 20 major reputable media outlets. The type of information
contained in the unclassified corpus will be diverse, matching the breadth of textual information
types available to analysts on classified networks. In addition to news reports, the corpus will
include analysis and opinion articles and reference materials.
11
The data to be used in classified tuning and testing of Performer systems will not be directly visible
to Performers. The data will reside on a classified testbed and will consist of source reports and
analytic products covering the same time period as the unclassified corpus.
At the beginning of the program the history available in both corpora will extend back at least 25
years. The corpora will be kept up to date as the REASON Program progresses.
In addition to the bulk corpora described above, Performers will be provided with annotated
examples for 5 Challenge Problems each for TA1, TA2, and TA3 REASON Comment Quality.
These annotated examples will include Challenge Problems, example solutions, and evaluation of
these solutions. Performers will not be provided with any annotations for data beyond these
example Challenge Problems.
b. Performer-Provided Data
Each Performer is expected to have a unique technical solution to the REASON challenges and
may require additional data for model training, model running, internal evaluation, or other
research needs. Proposals must present a dataset development plan detailing how the team intends
to obtain the data required. This documentation should account for any other associated labor to
curate and facilitate use of data that are acquired.
As part of their proposal, each team shall prepare a REASON Privacy Plan Version 1.0 that
comprehensively describes the efforts the team will take to protect personally identifiable
information and safeguard the security of any personal data collected or services involved in
collection, transmission, processing, and storage of these data. Any claims that data are anonymous
must be based on evidence and supported with sufficient information regarding how the data have
been anonymized.
This version 1.0 of the REASON Privacy Plan shall be included in the Proposer’s proposal as
Attachment 6 that covers all external datasets to be leveraged as part of the proposed research
approaches. The REASON Privacy Plan shall be updated at the beginning of each Phase and when
new sources of data or datasets are proposed for use within a Performer’s REASON research
activities, including data used for either development or evaluation purposes.
6. Test and Evaluation (T&E)
T&E will be conducted by an independent team of contractor staff carrying out evaluation and
analyses of Performer research deliverables using program test datasets and protocols. In addition
to independent T&E, the program will regularly gauge interim progress of Performer research
activities towards REASON objectives and target metrics using T&E results measured and
reported by the Performer teams themselves.
The REASON Program will pursue rigorous and comprehensive T&E to ensure that research
outcomes are well characterized, deliverables are aligned with program objectives, and
performance is measured across the full range of conditions. T&E activities will inform IARPA
and Government stakeholders on REASON research progress and serve as invaluable feedback to
Performers to improve their research approaches, training practices, and system development.
12
Performers will have specific Deliverable Milestones driven by the REASON evaluation cycle
schedule at which all subcomponent and system algorithms and software will be delivered to
IARPA and its designated T&E Team. The T&E Team will then conduct independent evaluations
with the objective of characterizing the quality, functionality, and performance of the REASON
systems. In addition to quantitative measurements, T&E assessments will be carried out to
establish a thorough understanding of the progress, status, and limitations of the Performer’s
research.
For classified testing, the T&E Team will retrain Performer systems to classified data as necessary,
using scripts or processes provided by the Performers.
T&E results and feedback will be provided to Performers at regular intervals to keep them abreast
of current independent performance measurements and to inform and improve their R&D
approaches and methods. T&E will provide unclassified feedback summarizing the results of the
unclassified testing and the classified testing to Performers. T&E results from all Performers will
be shared with all teams to establish an understanding of the current state and progress of REASON
research; T&E results will also be shared with USG external stakeholders, including their
contractors, for Government purposes. IARPA may conduct other supplemental evaluations or
measurements at its sole discretion to evaluate the Performers’ research and Deliverables.
A notional evaluation cycle schedule is indicated as part of the overall REASON Program
Schedule in Figure 1. For each TA, an evaluation cycle will consist of approximately 25 Challenge
Problems developed by T&E. The format for Challenge Problems will vary across the TAs and
will be specified in the Phase 1 T&E Plan at Program Kickoff. Within an evaluation cycle each
Performer system will receive the same Challenge Problems. Challenge Problems will differ
across evaluation cycles. For TA1, TA2, and TA3 REASON Comment Quality evaluations, T&E
will provide 5 Practice Challenge Problems as examples prior to the first cycle for that type of
evaluation. The Practice Challenge Problems will include the inputs to Performer systems, an
emulated Performer system solution, and annotation of that solution according to the evaluation
procedure in the T&E plan.
7. Program Metrics
Achievement of metrics is a performance indicator under IARPA research contracts. IARPA has
defined REASON program metrics to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed solutions in achieving
the stated program goal and objectives, and to determine whether satisfactory progress is being
made. The metrics described in this BAA are shared with the intent to scope the effort, while
affording maximum flexibility, creativity, and innovation to Proposers proposing solutions to the
stated problem.
The REASON T&E protocols and evaluation methodology are currently under development;
further details will be provided at Program Kickoff in the Phase 1 REASON T&E Plan. Program
metrics may be refined during the various phases of the REASON program; if metrics change,
revised metrics will be communicated in a timely manner to Performers. The evaluation
methodology may be revised by the Government at any time during the program lifecycle to better
meet program needs. The preliminary program metrics and target scores are provided below.
The TA1 metric is a modified version of alpha normalized discounted cumulative gain (αnDCG),
which will use the union of the outputs (evidence items) from all Performers and combine it with 
13
the outputs of a manual search for evidence by the T&E team in order to approximate the ideal
results. The formula for αnDCG will be:
αnDCG = αDCG(Performer results)
max (αDCG(All Performer results ∪ T&E discovered items))
The scoring process will be:
1. T&E performs a manual search of the corpus for evidence at the time they create each TA1
Challenge Problem. Some of their search results will be cited in the draft report, which is
used as the input to Performer systems; others will be reserved but not cited.
2. The Performer systems produce a set of up to 8 ordered evidence items found in the corpus
as the output for the Challenge Problem.
3. The output evidence item result sets from the several Performer systems are combined with
the reserved evidence items from step 1. The same item may be returned by multiple
Performers or may match the T&E items.
4. Each of the items in the resulting set from step 3 are evaluated:
a. Is the item redundant to the cited evidence in the draft report?
b. What is the relevance of the item?
c. What category does the item belong to? For example, if the analysis report deals
with a potential military invasion, then one category might include evidence of
troop movements, another might include public statements by leaders, a third might
include previous examples of similar circumstances, etc. The categories will be
used to calculate the diversity of the cited evidence.
5. For each candidate subset of 8 items from the result set compiled in step 3 as assessed in
step 4, determine the α-DCG. Take the maximum value as the denominator for computing
α-nDCG.
The reason for including all Performer outputs as candidates for the denominator of the α-nDCG
metric is a recognition that T&E may not a priori find the maximal set of diverse, relevant evidence
for the Challenge Problem in the corpus. It is possible that Performer systems will identify
evidence not located in a manual search.
TA2 has two metrics: Reasoning Explanation Quality (REQ) and F1. REQ will assess the
explainability of the identified strengths and weaknesses. T&E raters will evaluate the correctness
and clarity of each explanation of a reasoning strength or weakness on a 1-4 scale. Details for
assigning REQ scores will be provided at Program Kickoff in the Phase 1 T&E Plan.
T&E will measure Performer system’s identification of strengths and weaknesses in reasoning of
draft report evaluated using F1 Score, which gives credit for two features:
• If the system says X is a strength or weakness, is the system correct (i.e. is the system
output a true positive?) or is it wrong (i.e. the system output is a false positive).
• If X is a strength or weakness, does the system says so? (If not, then the system output is
a false negative)
14
TA3 has two metrics. The first is REASON Comment Quality (RCQ). T&E raters will evaluate
the comments provided by the Performer TA3 system. RCQ scores will be based on correctness,
appropriateness, and clarity of the comments, using a 1 (poor) - 4 (excellent) scale. Details for
assigning RCQ scores will be provided at Program Kickoff in the Phase 1 T&E Plan.
The second TA3 metric applies to the final exam. The finished analytic reports produced by the
human participants will be evaluated by T&E raters using Report Quality Score (RQS). RQS is
based on scores of six of the IC Analytic Tradecraft Standards: sourcing, uncertainty, assumptions,
alternatives, logic, and accuracy. Each finished report will be graded on each standard, with a range
from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent), so RQS values range from 6 to 24. Each performer system’s RQS
will be compared to the RQS for the control group.
A summary of metric targets by Phase is shown in Table 1; these are subject to change over the
course of the program. Final Phase 1 metrics will be presented at kickoff.

8. Program Waypoints, Milestones, and Deliverables
Waypoints, Milestones, and Deliverables are established from the Program’s onset to ensure
alignment with REASON objectives, organize research activities in a logical and reportable
manner, and facilitate consistent and efficient communication among all stakeholders – IARPA,
REASON T&E, USG Stakeholders, and Research Performers. A schedule of key program
milestones and deliverables in shown in Figure 1.

b. Software Deliverable Formatting
Performers will be required to provide algorithm and software deliverables (including source code
and executables) in a manner that conforms to a standardized industrial method or methods that
will be provided at Program Kickoff. To facilitate planning, Offerors may assume that the
standardized configuration will require the use of software containerization technology (e.g.,
Docker and a REST API). This means that the entirety of a Performer’s system for TA1, TA2, and
TA3 REASON Comment Quality evaluations, including pre- and post-processing, must be
included within the delivered software container. These systems must be able to accept inputs in
the form of Challenge Problems from an API to be developed by the T&E team and to submit
outputs to that API. All official evaluations performed by T&E will use the computational 
17
resources available on the testbeds to be developed by T&E. Performers are not required to
identify or estimate the costs for these resources.
For TA3 Final Exams, the portion of Performer software facing analysts will be required to run
within a word processing application. For planning purposes, Offerors may assume that this will
be a Microsoft Word 365 add-in. These TA3 components will be permitted to access containerized
TA1 and TA2 components running on the same testbed. They will not be permitted to access
resources outside of the testbed.
For software that includes models that require initial training, the expectation is for the initial
model training to occur on Performer systems, with the ability for the T&E Team to re-train and
test the model with the same and/or other data.
If Offerors plan to use cloud computing resources for model development and training, they should
include descriptions of these requirements in their technical approach descriptions. Retraining of
Performer systems for T&E purposes will be subject to limitations on system retraining time and
resources. Those limitations will be briefed at Program Kickoff. Offerors must specify the runtime
resources and services required for their delivered software in terms equivalent to a configuration
on either Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.
Each team is required to include among their Key Personnel a Lead System Integrator (LSI) who
shall be responsible for preparing software deliverable subcomponents, modules, and systems,
performing quality control of deliverables, and integrating key components into the primary
REASON system(s). The LSI will also oversee communication and coordination across a
Performer’s research teams including subcontractors, if applicable, to ensure that research products
are functional, integrated and following software coding best practices (e.g., inline comments,
documentation). Additional team members and roles are dependent on the proposed research, as
such, there is no predetermined or required skill mix.
c. Program API
The REASON Program will use a standardized API for all software deliverables and evaluations.
The first version of the REASON API will be provided to Performers at the Phase 1 Kickoff
Meeting and updated periodically thereafter. The API will define function calls and data structures
for operating and evaluating REASON software in a standardized manner. The API will be
functionally identical for unclassified and classified testing. Specifically, the API will provide
access to the document corpus for automated, unsupervised retraining of Performer systems,
delivery of the Challenge Problems used in T&E evaluations, and submission of result sets for
Challenge Problems.
d. End of Phase Final Reports
At the end of each Program Phase Performers will be required to submit a comprehensive Final
Report that describes their efforts and results during the Phase. These reports shall include an
executive summary, a description of the technical approach taken, details on the results, findings,
and technical insights gained from the R&D effort, lessons learned, and suggested future research
directions. The Final Report shall also include high level system design documentation for the
final software deliverable. This design documentation shall include any hardware requirements 
18
and dependencies on third-party software libraries.
9. Meeting, Travel, and Publication Requirements
Performers are expected to assume responsibility for administration of their projects and to comply
with contractual and program requirements for reporting, attendance at program workshops, and
availability for site visits. The following paragraphs describe typical expectations for meetings and
travel for IARPA programs as well as the contemplated frequency and locations of such meetings.
In addition to ensuring that all necessary details of developed software, algorithm, and operational
instructions are clear and complete, each Performer will be required to be available for questions
and troubleshooting from the T&E Team via electronic mail or in periodic technical exchange
meetings.
a. Workshops
All Performer teams are expected to attend workshops, to include Key Personnel from prime and
subcontractor organizations.
The REASON Program intends to hold a program Kickoff Meeting workshop in the first month
of the program and first month of the subsequent program phase. In addition, the program will
hold a PI Review Meeting at the end of each phase and at the phase midpoint. Kickoff Meetings
and PI Review Meetings may be combined for logistical convenience.
Both types of meetings will likely be held in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, but IARPA
may opt to co-locate the meeting with a relevant external conference or workshop to increase
synergy with stakeholders. IARPA reserves the right to hold the meeting virtually for logistical or
health and safety reasons.
Kickoff Meetings will typically be one day in duration and will focus on plans for the coming
Phase, Performer planned research, and internal program discussions. PI Review Meetings will
typically be two days in duration and will have a greater focus on communicating program progress
and plans to USG stakeholders. These meetings will include additional time allocated to
presentation and discussion of research accomplishments.
In both cases, the workshops will focus on technical aspects of the program and on facilitating
open technical exchanges, interaction, and sharing among the various program participants.
Program participants will be expected to present the technical status and progress of their projects
to other participants and invited guests. Individual sessions for each Performer team with the
REASON Program Manager and the T&E Team may be scheduled to coincide with these
workshops. Non-proprietary information will be shared by Performers in the open meeting
sessions; proprietary information sharing shall occur during individual breakout sessions with the
REASON Program Manager and the T&E team.
b. Site Visits
Site visits by the Government Team will generally take place semiannually during the life of the
program. These visits will occur at the Performer’s facility and last no longer than two days.
Reports on technical progress, details of successes and issues, contributions to the program goals, 
19
and technology demonstrations will be expected at such site visits. IARPA reserves the right to
conduct additional site visits on an as-needed basis.
c. Publication Approval
It is anticipated that research funded under this program will be unclassified research that will not
require a pre-publication review. However, performers should note that pre-publication approval
of research information associated with IARPA may be required if it is determined that the release
of such information may result in the disclosure of sensitive information. Prior to public release, a
courtesy soft copy of any work submitted for publication must be provided to the IARPA Program
Manager and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), as well as a copy of the publication.
10. Period of Performance
The REASON program is envisioned as a 42-month effort that is intended to begin November 1,
2023.
Phase 1 (Base Period): November 1, 2023 – October 31, 2025
Phase 2 (Option 1): November 1, 2025 - April 30, 2027
11. Place of Performance
Performance will be conducted at the Performers’ sites.
12. Security
Proposals must be entirely unclassified. If a proposer wishes to cite prior classified efforts, they
may only provide an unclassified summary of this work.
All Performer work will be unclassified. Performer systems will be tested using classified data,
but Performers will not be able to review that classified data. Performers will be provided with
unclassified summary results from classified testing. Even if a Performer has cleared personnel,
they will not receive additional classified feedback.
13. Human Subjects Research
Performer human subjects research for REASON is encouraged, but not required. Performers
planning on conducting human subjects research as part of their technical approach must identify
this in their proposal, along with plans for obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.
IRB approval documents must be provided to the Government before commencing any internal
human subjects research. DFARS clause 252.235-7004 is applicable to this solicitation and will
be included in any resultant contract award that support research that includes or may include
human subjects research.
Performers are not responsible for obtaining IRB approval for official T&E evaluation events. For
these events the T&E organization will obtain the necessary approvals.
20
B. Federal Award Information
Anticipated awards will be made in the form of procurement contracts and are subject to the
availability of appropriations. Multiple awards are anticipated. Funding for the Option Period will
be contingent upon satisfactory performance and the availability of funds.
The BAA shall result in selection of proposals addressing all phases of REASON and awarding of
funds aligning with Phase 1 research activities. Funding for the Option Period shall depend upon
performance during the Base Period (and succeeding Option Period) against the program goals
and metrics, the availability of funding, and IARPA priorities. Funding of the Option Period is at
the sole discretion of the Government.
The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, one, or none of the proposals
received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors. The
Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is deemed necessary. Additionally,
the Government reserves the right to accept proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of
proposals for negotiations of award, in the event that the Government desires to award only
portions of a proposal.
Awards under this BAA shall be made to offerors on the basis of the Evaluation Criteria listed in
Section E.1 of the BAA, as well as program balance, and availability of funds. Proposals selected
for negotiation may result in a procurement contract.
The Government shall contact offerors whose proposals are selected for negotiations to obtain
additional information for award. The Government may establish a deadline for the close of factfinding and negotiations that allows a reasonable time for the award of a contract. Offerors that
are not responsive to Government deadlines established and communicated with the request will
be removed from award consideration. Offerors will also be removed from award consideration
should the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms, conditions,
and cost/price.
The ACC-APG RTP Division has the authority to award a variety of instruments on behalf of
ARL-ARO. The ACC-APG RTP Division reserves the right to use the type of instrument most
appropriate for the effort proposed. Applicants should familiarize themselves with these
instrument types and the applicable regulations before submitting a proposal. Following is a brief
description of the possible award instrument.
1. Procurement Contract. A legal instrument, consistent with 31 U.S.C. 6303, which reflects a
relationship between the Federal Government and a State Government, a local government, or
other entity/contractor when the principal purpose of the instrument is to acquire property or
services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
Contracts are primary governed by the following regulations:
a. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far 
21
b. Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
https://www.federalregister.gov/defense-federal-acquisition-regulation-supplementdfarsc. Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS)
https://www.acquisition.gov/afars
C. Eligibility Information
1. Eligible Applicants:
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.
Eligible applicants under this BAA include Institutions of higher education (foreign and domestic),
nonprofit organizations, and for-profit concerns (large and small businesses). Proposals are
encouraged from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (as determined by the Secretary of
Education to meet requirements of Title III of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20
U.S.C. §1061) and from Minority Institutions defined as institutions “whose enrollment of a single
minority or a combination of minorities exceeds 50 percent of the total enrollment.” [20 U.S.C. §
1067k(3) and 10 U.S.C. § 4144]. However, no funds are specifically allocated for HBCU/MI
participation.
Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, University
Affiliated Research Centers, Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated facilities, Government
Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization that have a special relationship
with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or proprietary information or access
to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to submit proposals under this BAA or
participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. An entity of which
only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligible to submit a proposal or participate
as a team member, subject to an organizational conflict of interest review.
Foreign entities and/or individuals may participate to the extent that such participants comply with
any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, and all U.S. Export Control
Laws and regulations, and other governing statutes applicable under the circumstances to include
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFE Parts 730 through 799, as amended, in the
performance of any future contract. Offerors are expected to ensure that the efforts of foreign
participants do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the United States, nor its
security interests. As such, both foreign and domestic Offerors should carefully consider the roles
and responsibilities of foreign participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.
In the absence of available license exemptions or exceptions, the offeror shall be responsible for
obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of (including deemed
exports) hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance. The
offeror shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign
persons in the performance of any future contract, including instances where the work is to be
performed on-site at any Government installation (whether in or outside the United States), where
the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technologies, including technical data or
software. The offerorshall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated 
22
with the use of licenses and license exemptions or exceptions. The offeror shall appropriately mark
all contract deliverables controlled by ITAR and/or EAR.
Proposals will be evaluated only if they are for fundamental scientific study and experimentation
directed towards advancing the scientific state of the art or increasing basic knowledge and
understanding. Proposals focused on specific devices or components are beyond the scope of this
BAA.
1.A.1 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” means that because of other
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render
impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the
contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to
potential OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (sub awardee,
consultant). Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each
proposal submitted pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as
applicable, proposed team member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include
a description of the actions the Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of
conflicting roles that might bias the Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an
unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI
in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits contractors/Performers from concurrently providing Scientific
Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar
support services and being a technical Performer. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure
requirement above, address whether an Offeror or an Offeror’s team member (e.g., sub awardee,
consultant) is providing SETA, A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under:
(a) a current award or subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward.
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal must include:
• The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
• The prime contract number;
• Identification of proposed team member (sub awardee, consultant) providing the support.
As part of their proposal, Offerors shall include either (a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates
have any potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in
II.H.7.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise
selectable under the BAA Evaluation Factors. 
23
The Government may require Offerors to provide additional information to assist the Government
in evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans.
If the Government determines that an Offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide
the affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the Offeror’s OCI and proposed
OCI mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration
for award.
1.A.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Organizations may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the
BAA. However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are
selected, such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can
be paid twice to perform the same task).
1.A.3 U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or
services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the
sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or
arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate
officials of the institution.”
Offerors must submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter for
each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is
serving in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their
technical proposal. Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g.,
President, Chancellor, Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the
Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter is enclosed in II.H.2 of this BAA. Note that IARPA
shall not enter into negotiations with an Offeror whose team includes a U.S. academic institution
until all required Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.
2. Cost Sharing or Matching:
There is no requirement for cost sharing, matching, or cost participation to be eligible for award
under this BAA. Cost sharing and matching is not an evaluation factor used under this BAA.
3. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and University Affiliated
Research Centers:
Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs), including Department of Energy
National Laboratories, and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) are not eligible to
receive awards, as primes or sub-awardees, under this BAA.

a. SAM (https://sam.gov)
b. ARL website (https://www.arl.army.mil/business/broad-agency-announcements/)
c. IARPA website (https://www.iarpa.gov)
Amendments, if any, to this BAA will be posted to these websites when they occur. Interested
parties are encouraged to periodically check these websites for updates and amendments.
The following information is for those wishing to respond to the BAA:
2. Content and Form of Application Submission
a. General Information
A proposal submitted under this BAA must address unclassified fundamental research.
Proposal submissions will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with
applicable laws and DoD regulations. Applicants are expected to appropriately mark each
page of their submission that contains proprietary information. The participating DoD and
other USG agencies will provide no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal
development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in
response to this BAA will not be returned. It is the policy of participating DoD agencies to
treat all proposals as sensitive, competitive information and to disclose their contents only
for the purposes of evaluation.
Post-Employment Conflict of Interest: There are certain post-employment restrictions on
former federal officers and employees, including special government employees (Section
207 of Title 18, U.S.C.). If an applicant believes a conflict of interest may exist, the
situation should be discussed with Point of Contact listed in Section G: Agency Contacts,
who will then coordinate with appropriate ARO/ARL legal personnel prior to having
applicant expend time and effort in preparing a proposal.
Equipment: Normally, title to equipment or other tangible property purchased with
Government funds vests with nonprofit institutions of higher education or with nonprofit
research organizations if vesting will facilitate scientific research performed for the
Government. For profit organizations are expected to possess the necessary plant and
equipment to conduct the proposed research. Deviations may be made on a case-by-case
basis to allow commercial organizations to purchase equipment but disposition instructions
must be followed.
b. Proposal Format
To facilitate the evaluation of the proposal, the government encourages the offerors to
submit proposals which: are clear and concise; limited to essential matters sufficient to
demonstrate a complete understanding of the Government’s requirements; include
sufficient detail for effective evaluation; and provide convincing rationale to address how 
25
the offeror intends to meet these requirements and objectives, rather than simply rephrasing
or restating the Government’s requirements and objectives.
All proposals shall be in the format given below. Non-compliant proposals may be rejected
without review. Proposals shall consist of “Volume 1 - Technical and Management
Proposal” and “Volume 2 - Cost Proposal.” All proposals shall be written in English.
Additionally, text should be black and paper size 8-1/2 by 11-inch, white in color with 1”
margins from paper edge to text or graphic on all sides. The Government desires Times
New Roman font with font size not smaller than 12-point. The Government desires that the
font size for figures, tables and charts not be smaller than 10-point. All contents shall be
clearly legible with the unaided eye. Excessive use of small font, for other than figures,
tables, and charts, or unnecessary use of figures, tables, and charts to present information
may render the proposal non-compliant. Front and backside of a single sheet are counted
as two (2) pages if both sides are printed upon. Foldout pages are not permitted. The page
limitation for full proposals includes all figures, tables, and charts. All pages should be
numbered. No other materials may be incorporated in any portion of the proposal by
reference, as a means to circumvent page count limitations. All information pertaining to a
volume shall be contained within that volume. Any information beyond the page
limitations will not be considered in the evaluation of offerors.
The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be
UNCLASSIFIED.
The Technical and Management proposal submitted in response to this BAA shall consist
of the following:
Volume 1 – Technical & Management Proposal
Section 1 - Cover Sheet - Technical (see Section II.H) & Transmittal Letter (not included
in page count)
Section 2 – Summary of Proposal, not to exceed 5 pages
Section 3 – Detailed Proposal, not to exceed 30 pages
Section 4 – Attachments (Not included in page count of Volume 1, but numbered
appropriately for elements included. Templates are in Section II.H of this BAA.)
i. Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letter, if required
ii. IP Rights, estimated not to exceed 4 pages
iii. OCI Notification or Certification

and team (subcontractors and consultants), the BAA number, IARPA program name, offerors’
Program name, the proposal validity period, the type of contract vehicle being requested
(procurement contract) with a short rationale, any non-negotiable conditions on which the offer is
based such as contract type (cost type, FFP), IP restrictions, etc., and the offeror’s points of contact
information including: name, email and phone number for both technical and administrative issues.
Note: Any information required elsewhere in the proposal must be included in the appropriate
section of the proposal (i.e., including the information in the transmittal letter alone may not be
sufficient). If there is a conflict between the transmittal letter and the proposal the proposal shall
control.
Section 2: Summary of Proposal (not to exceed 5 pages)
Section 2 shall provide an overview of the proposed work as well as introduce associated technical
and management issues. This section shall contain a technical description of technical approach to
the research as well as a succinct portrayal of the uniqueness and benefits of the proposed work. It
shall make the technical objectives clear and quantifiable and shall provide a project schedule with
definite decision points and endpoints.
Offerors shall address:
A. A technical overview of the proposed research and plan. This section is the centerpiece of
the proposal and shall succinctly describe the proposed approach and research. The
overview shall provide an intuitive understanding of the approach and design, technical
rationale, and constructive plan for accomplishment of technical objectives and deliverable
production. The approach shall be supported by basic, clear calculations. Additionally,
proposals shall clearly explain the innovative claims and technical approaches that shall be 
27
employed to meet or exceed each program metric and provide ample justification as to why
approaches are feasible. The use of non-standard terms and acronyms should be avoided.
This section shall be supplemented with a more detailed plan in Volume 1, Section 3 of the
proposal.
B. Summary of the products, transferable technology and deliverables associated with the
proposed research results. Define measurable deliverables that show progress toward
achieving the stated Program Milestones. All proprietary claims to the results, prototypes,
intellectual property, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research,
results, and/or prototype shall be detailed in Volume 1 - Section 4 - IP Rights. If there are
no proprietary claims, this should be stated. Should no proprietary claims be made,
Government rights shall be unlimited to any resultant IP.
C. Schedule and milestones for the proposed research. Summarize, in table form and clearly
legible for all activity, the schedule and milestones for the proposed research. Do not
include proprietary information with the milestones. If designed as a Gantt chart or large
table, a representative image of the information can be embedded as a small image,
referencing an appendix Excel file of the entire schedule and milestones list.
D. Related research. General discussion of other research in this area, comparing the
significance and plausibility of the proposed innovations against competitive approaches
to achieve Program objectives.
E. Project contributors. Include a clearly defined and clearly legible organizational chart of
all anticipated project participants, organized under functional roles for the effort, and also
indicating associated task number responsibilities with individuals.
F. Technical Resource Summary:
• Summarize total level of effort by labor category and technical discipline (i.e., research
scientist/chemist/physicist/engineer/administrative, etc.) and affiliation (prime/
subcontractor/consultant). Key Personnel shall be identified by name. Provide a brief
description of the qualifications for each labor category (i.e., education, certifications,
years of experience, etc.)
• Summarize level of effort by labor category and technical discipline for each major
task.
• Identify software and intellectual property required to perform, by affiliation (list each
item separately)
• Identify materials and equipment (such as IT) required to perform, by affiliation (list
each item separately)
• Identify any other resources required to perform (i.e., services, data sets, data set
repository, facilities, government furnished property, etc.), by affiliation (list each item
separately)
• Summarize level of effort required to prepare research data for public access.
• Estimated travel, including purpose of travel and number of personnel per trip, by
affiliation.
• The above information shall cross reference to the tasks set forth in the offerors
statement of work, and shall be supported by the detailed cost and pricing information
provided in the offeror's Volume 2 Cost Proposal. 
28
Section 3: Detailed Proposal Information (Up to 30 pages)
This section of the proposal shall provide the detailed, in-depth discussion of the proposed research
as well as supporting information about the offeror’s capabilities and resources. Specific attention
shall be given to addressing both the risks and payoffs of the proposed research and why the
proposed research is desirable for IARPA to pursue. This part shall provide:
A. Statement of Work (SOW) - In plain English, clearly define the technical tasks and subtasks
to be performed, their durations and the dependencies among them. A template will be
provided to assist in the development of consistent SOWs for all proposals. (See Section
II, H for an example). For each task and sub-task, provide:
• A general description of the objective;
• A detailed description of the approach to be taken, developed in an orderly progression
and in enough detail to establish the feasibility of accomplishing the goals of the task;
• Identification of the primary organization responsible for task execution (prime,
subcontractor, team member, etc.) by name;
• The exit criteria for each task/activity (i.e., a product, waypoint or milestone that
defines its completion); and
• Identification and definition of all deliverables (e.g., data (including public access),
reports, software, etc.) to be provided to the Government in support of the proposed
research tasks/activities.
Note: Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW.
At the end of this section of the proposal, provide a Gantt chart, showing all the tasks and
sub-tasks on the left with the performance period (in years/quarters) on the right. All
milestones shall be clearly labeled on the chart. If necessary, use multiple pages to ensure
legibility of all information.
B. A detailed description of the objectives, scientific relevance, technical approach and
expected significance of the work. The key elements of the proposed work should be
clearly identified and related to each other. Proposals should clearly detail the technical
methods and/or approaches that shall be used to meet or exceed each program milestone,
and should provide ample justification as to why the proposed methods/approaches are
feasible. Any anticipated risks should be described and possible mitigations proposed.
General discussion of the problem without detailed description of approaches, plausibility
of implementation, and critical metrics shall result in an unacceptable rating.
C. State-of-the-art. Comparison with other on-going research, highlighting the uniqueness of
the proposed effort/approach and differences between the proposed effort and the current
state-of-the-art. Identify advantages and disadvantages of the proposed work with respect
to potential alternative approaches. 
29
D. Data sources. Identification and description of data sources to be utilized in pursuit of the
project research goals.
Offerors proposing to use existing data sets shall provide written verification that all data
were obtained in accordance with U.S. laws and, where applicable, are in compliance with
End User License Agreements, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies
regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Offerors shall identify any restrictions on the
use or transfer of data sets being used, and, if there are any restrictions, the potential cost
to the Government to obtain at least Government Purpose Rights in such data sets.
Offerors proposing to obtain new data sets shall ensure that their plan for obtaining the data
complies with U.S. Laws and, where applicable, with End User License Agreement,
Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies regarding privacy protection of
U.S. Persons. Foreign offerors must ensure that their plan for obtaining the data complies
with the privacy protections applicable within the country that they are based in, as well.
While not necessary, if offerors propose using human samples they must include the
documentation required for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for use of Human
samples or declaration of why IRB approval is not necessary. Documentation must be well
written and logical; claims for exemptions from Federal regulations for human subject
protection must be accompanied by a strong defense of the claims. The Human Use
documentation and the written verification are not included in the total page count.
The Government reserves the right to reject a proposal if it does not appropriately address
all data issues.
E. Deliverables: Deliverables are identified in Section II of the BAA.
The Government requires, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rights for all deliverables
developed with mixed funding or that incorporate technical data or computer software
developed at private expense; anything less shall be considered a weakness in the proposal.
All other deliverables shall be delivered with unlimited rights in accordance with FAR
clause 52.227-14.
In the “Restrictions on Intellectual Property Rights” attachment of the proposal, offerors
shall describe the proposed approach to intellectual property for all deliverables, together
with a supporting rationale of why this approach is in the Government’s best interest. This
shall include all proprietary claims to the results, prototypes, intellectual property or
systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results and/or prototype,
and a brief explanation of how the offerors may use these materials in their program. To
the greatest extent feasible, offerors should not include background proprietary technical
data and computer software as the basis of their proposed technical approach.
If offerors (including their proposed teammates) desire to use in their proposed approach,
in whole or in part, technical data or computer software or both that is proprietary to the
offeror, any of its teammates, or any third party, in the “Restrictions on Intellectual
Property Rights” attachment they should: (1) clearly identify such data/software and its 
30
proposed particular use(s); (2) identify and explain any and all restrictions on the
Government’s ability to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose
technical data, computer software, and deliverables incorporating such technical data and
computer software; (3) identify the potential cost to the Government to acquire GPR in all
deliverables that use the proprietary technical data or computer software the offeror intends
to use; (4) explain how the Government shall be able to reach its program goals (including
transition) within the proprietary model offered; and (5) provide possible nonproprietary
alternatives in any area in which a Government entity would have insufficient rights to
transfer, within the Government or to Government contractors in support of a Government
purpose, deliverables incorporating proprietary technical data or computer software, or that
might cause increased risk or cost to the Government under the proposed proprietary
solutions.
Offerors also shall identify all commercial technical data and/or computer software that
may be embedded in any noncommercial deliverables contemplated under the research
effort, along with any applicable restrictions on the Government’s use of such commercial
technical data and/or computer software. If offerors do not identify any restrictions, the
Government shall assume that there are no restrictions on the Government’s use of such
deliverables. Offerors shall also identify all noncommercial technical data and/or computer
software that it plans to generate, develop and/or deliver under any proposed award
instrument in which the Government shall acquire less than unlimited rights. If the offeror
does not submit such information, the Government shall assume that it has unlimited rights
to all such noncommercial technical data and/or computer software. Offerors shall provide
a short summary for each item (commercial and noncommercial) asserted with less than
unlimited rights that describes the nature of the restriction and the intended use of the
intellectual property in the conduct of the proposed research.
Additionally, if offerors propose the use of any open source or freeware, any conditions,
restrictions or other requirements imposed by that software shall also be addressed in the
“Restrictions on Intellectual Property Rights” attachment. Offerors should review the
example format, found in Section II.H for their response. The technical content of the
“Restrictions on Intellectual Property Rights” attachment shall include only the
information necessary to address the proposed approach to intellectual property; any other
technical discussion in the attachment shall not be considered during the evaluation
process. The attachment is estimated not to exceed 4 pages.
For this solicitation, the Government recognizes only the definitions of intellectual
property rights in accordance with the terms as set forth in the Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) part 27, or as defined herein. If offerors propose intellectual property
rights that are not defined in FAR part 27 or herein, offerors shall clearly define such rights
in the “Restrictions on Intellectual Property Rights” attachment of their proposal. Offerors
are reminded of the requirement for prime contractors to acquire sufficient rights from
subcontractors to accomplish the program goals.
“Research data” is defined herein as “the digital recorded factual material commonly
accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings including 
31
data sets used to support scholarly publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks,
preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review
reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory
specimens.”
F. Cost, schedule, Milestones
Describe the cost, schedule, and milestones for the proposed research, including cost
estimates by cost element for base period, the option period(s) and the total program
summary, and company cost share, if any, as well as, costs by technical area(s) and tasks
(see tables below for sample format). The milestones shall not include proprietary
information (Offeror can use their own format for milestones).

how these will contribute to and influence the current work.
H. Facilities.
Describe the facilities that shall be used for the proposed effort, including computational
and experimental resources.
I. Detailed Management Plan.
Provide the Management Plan that clearly identifies both organizations and individuals
within organizations that make up the team, and delineate the expected duties, relevant
capabilities, and task responsibilities of team members and expected relationships among
team members. Identify the expected levels of effort (percentage time, or fraction of an
FTE) for all Key Personnel and significant contributors. Additionally, include a description
of the technical, administrative, and business structure of the team along with an internal
communications plan. Describe project/function/sub-contractor relationships (including
formal teaming agreements), Government research interfaces, and planning, scheduling,
and control practices utilized, as well as the team leadership structure. Provide a brief
biography of all Key Personnel (including alternates, if desired) and significant
contributors who shall be involved in the research along with the amount of effort to be
expended by each person during the year. Participation by all Key Personnel and significant 
32
contributors is expected to exceed 25% of their time. A compelling explanation is required
for any variation from this figure.
If the team intends to use consultants, they shall also be included in the organizational chart
with an indication of whether the person shall be an “individual” or “organizational”
consultant (i.e., representing themselves or their organization), and organizational
affiliation.
See Section H for the recommended format.
J. Resource Share.
Include the type of support, if any, the Offeror might request from the Government, such
as facilities, equipment, materials, or any such resources the Offeror is willing to provide
at no additional cost to the Government to support the research effort. Cost sharing is not
required from Offerors and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is
a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed
research and development effort.
K. The names of other federal, state or local agencies or other parties receiving the proposal
and/or funding the proposed effort.
If none, state “None”. Concurrent submission of the proposal to other organizations will
not prejudice its review but may impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort.
L. Research Data Management Plan. (RDMP).
Submit a RDMP that outlines how they will manage and preserve the Research Data, as
defined below, collected or produced through the course of performance. The RDMP need
not require the preservation of all Research Data: Offerors shall consider the cost and
benefits of managing and preserving the Research Data in determining whether to preserve
it. At a minimum, all Research Data associated with a peer-reviewed manuscript or final
published article (hereinafter “Publications”) must be made publicly accessible by the
award recipient before, on or at a reasonable time after the publication date. The
Publications whose associated data must be covered by the RDMP are deliverables as
described in Section 1.
Research Data is defined herein as the digital recorded factual material commonly accepted
in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings including data sets
used to support scholarly publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks,
preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review
reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory
specimens.
The RDMP must address the following:
• Describe the types of Research Data collected or produced in the course of the
project. Include standards to be used for Research Data and metadata content and 
33
format.
• A plan for making the Research Data that underlie Publications digitally accessible
to the public before or, at the time of publication or conference presentation, or
within a reasonable time after publication. The requirement could be met by
including the data as supplementary information to the Publication or by depositing
the Research Data in a searchable, machine-readable and digitally accessible form
suitable for repositories available to the public free of charge. Such repositories
could be discipline-specific repositories, general purpose research data repositories
or institutional repositories. The published article or conference paper should
indicate how the public may access Research Data underlying the paper’s results
and findings. Offerors should attempt to make the Research Data available for at
least three years after published article or conference. (NOTE: Offerors shall make
a best effort in identifying research data sets that may be used for Publications that
occur after contract end. The Offeror shall deliver these data sets to the Government
and make them available in repositories available to the public prior to the end of
the period of performance, if not included as supplementary information to
Publications.)
• Policies and provisions for sharing and preservation, including a) policies and
provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, and IP,
b) descriptions of tools, including software, needed to access and interpret the
Research Data, and c) policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and
production of derivatives.
• If, for legitimate reasons (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, security, IP rights
considerations; size of data sets, cost; time), the Research Data underlying the
results of peer-reviewed publications or conference papers cannot be shared and
preserved, the plan must include a justification citing such reasons.
In addressing these elements (e.g., types of data to be shared and preserved, standards to
be used for data and metadata, repositories to be used for archiving data, timeframes for
sharing and preservation), the RDMP should reflect the best practices of the relevant
scientific discipline and research community. At a minimum, Research Data underlying
Publications and associated metadata shall include an acknowledgement of IARPA support
and a link to the associated Publication.
Section 4: Attachments
[Note: The attachments listed below shall be included with the proposal, under Volume 1, if
applicable, but do not count against the Volume 1 page limit. For attachments which are not
applicable, Offerors must still include a statement of “Attachment [X]: Not applicable”.]
A. Attachment 1: Signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter(s) (if applicable). A
template is provided in Section II.H.
B. Attachment 2: IP Rights. A template is provided in Section II.H.
This attachment is estimated not to exceed 4 pages and shall address the following:
Representation as to Rights. An Offeror shall provide a good faith representation that they 
34
either own or have sufficient licensing rights to all IP that will be utilized under their
proposal. Program-Specific IP Approach. The Government requires sufficient rights to IP
developed or used in the conduct of the proposed research to ensure that the Government
can successfully: (a) manage the program and evaluate the technical output and
deliverables, (b) communicate program information across Government organizations, and
(c) support transition to and further use and development of the program results by
Intelligence community (IC) users and others. The Government anticipates that achieving
these goals for the REASON program may necessitate a minimum of Unlimited Rights in
all deliverables. However, there may be any number of other approaches to intellectual
property rights to achieve IARPA’s program goals. “Unlimited rights” means the rights of
the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to
the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose,
and to have or permit others to do so. In addressing their approach to IP rights, Offerors
should: (1) describe the intended use of patented invention(s) or data, including, technical
data and computer software, in the conduct of the proposed research; (2) describe the rights
being offered to the Government along with a justification if less than Unlimited Rights is
being offered; (3) explain how IARPA will be able to reach its program goals (including
transition) with the rights offered to the Government; (4) identify the cost to the
Government to acquire additional or alternative rights beyond those being offered, if
applicable; and (5) provide possible alternatives in any area in which the offered rights may
be insufficient for the Government to achieve its program goals (e.g., the possibility of
future licensing of privately-developed software to U.S. Government agencies at a
reasonable cost.)
Patented Inventions. Offerors shall include documentation using the format provided in
Section II.H, proving ownership of or sufficient rights to all inventions (or inventions for
which a patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under the proposal for the
IARPA program. If a patent application has been filed for an invention that the proposal
utilizes, but the application has not yet been made publicly available and contains
proprietary information, the Offeror may provide only the serial number, inventor
name(s), assignee names (if any), filing date, filing date of any related provisional
application, and a summary of the patent title, together with either: (1) a representation
that the Offeror owns the invention, or (2) proof of sufficient licensing rights in the
invention. Offerors shall also indicate their intention to incorporate patented technology
into any deliverable—i.e., if Offerors intend for any deliverable to embody any invention
covered by any patent or patent application the Offerors listed in Volume 1, Attachment
2, Offerors should also specify in the Attachment the deliverable into which the Offerors
expects to incorporate the invention. In doing so, the Government requests that Offerors
further specify any rights offered to the Government for inventions that shall be utilized
in the program (beyond the implied license that accompanies a patent owner’s sale of a
patented product).
Noncommercial Data. Offerors shall identify all noncommercial data, including technical
data and computer software, that it plans to generate, develop and/or deliver under any
proposed award instrument in which the Government shall acquire less than unlimited
rights. In doing so, Offerors must assert: (a) the specific restrictions the Government’s 
35
rights in those deliverables, (b) the basis for such restrictions, (c) the intended use of the
technical data and noncommercial computer software in the conduct of the proposed
research and development of applicable deliverables, and (d) a supporting rationale of why
the proposed approach to data rights is in the Government’s best interest (please see
program specific goals above). If no restrictions are intended, then the Offeror shall state
“NONE.”
Commercial Data. Offerors shall identify all commercial data, including technical data
and commercial computer software, that may be included in any deliverables
contemplated under the research effort and assert any applicable restrictions on the
Government’s use of such commercial data (please see program specific goals above). If
no restrictions are intended, then the Proposer shall state “NONE.”
Data Developed with Mixed Funding. If mixed funding is anticipated in data generated,
developed, and/or delivered under the research effort, the Government seeks at minimum
“Government Purpose Rights” (GPR) for all noncommercial data deliverables; offering
anything less shall be considered a weakness in the proposal. United States Government
purposes include any activity in which the United States Government is a party,
including cooperative agreements with international or multinational defense
organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign
governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive
procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose technical data or computer software for commercial purposes or
authorize others to do so. Government Purpose Rights continue for a five-year period
upon execution of the contract, and upon expiration of the five-year period, the
Government obtains Unlimited Rights in the data.
Open Source. If Offerors propose the use of any open-source data or freeware, any
conditions, restrictions or other requirements imposed by that software shall also be
addressed. Offerors should leverage the format in Section II.H for their response.
Identification of Relevant Government Contracts. For all technical data and computer
software that an Offeror intends to deliver with other than unlimited rights that are
identical or substantially similar to technical data and computer software that the Offeror
has produced for, delivered to, or is obligated to deliver to the Government under any
contract or subcontract, the Offeror shall identify: (a) the contract number under which
the data, software, or documentation was produced; (b) the contract number under
which, and the name and address of the organization to whom, the data and software was
most recently delivered or shall be delivered; and (c) any limitations on the
Government’s rights to use or disclose the data and software, including, when
applicable, identification of the earliest date the limitations expire.
Definitions. For this solicitation, IARPA recognizes only the definitions of IP rights in
accordance with the terms as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part
27 or as defined herein. If Offerors propose IP rights that are not defined in FAR part 27
or herein, Offerors shall clearly define such rights in the “Intellectual Property Rights” 
36
Attachment of their proposal. Offerors are reminded of the requirement for prime
contractors to acquire sufficient rights from subcontractors to accomplish the program
goals.
Evaluation. The Government may use the asserted data rights during the evaluation
process to evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions. The technical content of the
“Intellectual Property Rights” Attachment shall include only the information necessary
to address the proposed approach to IP; any other technical discussion in the attachment
shall not be considered during the evaluation process.
C. Attachment 3: OCI Notification or Certification Template provided in Section II.H.
D. Attachment 4: Bibliography. A brief bibliography of relevant technical papers and research
notes (published and unpublished) which document the technical ideas on which the
proposal is based.
E. Attachment 5: Relevant Papers. Copies of not more than three relevant papers may be
included in the submission. The Offerors shall include a one-page technical summary of
each paper provided, suitable for individuals who are not experts in the field.
F. Attachment 6: Consultant Commitment Letters.
G. Attachment 7: Human Use Documentation.
H. Attachment 8: A Three Chart Summary of the Proposal. A PowerPoint summary that
quickly and succinctly indicates the concept overview, key innovations, expected impact,
and other unique aspects of the proposal. The format for the summary slides is included in
Section II.H to this BAA and does not count against the page limit. Slide 1 should be a
self-contained, intuitive description of the technical approach and performance. These
slides may be used during the evaluation process to present a summary of the proposal
from the Offeror’s view.
I. Attachment 9: RDMP (estimated as 2 to 3 pages). Template provided in Section II.H.
J. Attachment 10: Privacy Plan.

U.S.C. A§ 1681 Et. Seq.), the Department of Defense is collecting certain
demographic and career information to be able to assess the success rates of women
who are proposed for key roles in applications in STEM disciplines. To enable this
assessment, each application must also include the following forms completed as
indicated:
Research and Related Senior/Key Person Profile: The Degree Type and Degree
Year fields on the Research and Related Senior/Key Person Profile {Expanded}
form will be used by DoD as the source for career information. In addition to the
required fields on the form, applicants must complete these two fields for all
individuals that are identified as having the project role of PD/Pl or Co-PD/Pl on
the form. Additional senior/key persons can be added by selecting the "Next
Person" button.
Related Personal Data: This form will be used by DoD as the source of
demographic information, such as gender, race, ethnicity, and disability
information for the Project Director/Principal Investigator and all other persons
identified as Co-Project Director{s)/Co-Principal Investigator(s). Each application
must include this form with the name fields of the Project Director/Principal
Investigator and any Co-Project Director(s)/Co-Principal Investigator(s)
completed; however, provision of the demographic information in the form is
voluntary. If completing the form for multiple individuals, each Co-Project
Director/Co-Principal Investigator can be added by selecting the "Next Person"
button. The demographic information, if provided, will be used for statistical
purposes only and will not be made available to merit reviewers. Applicants who
do not wish to provide some or all of the information should check or select the
"Do not wish to provide" option.
• Research and Related Other Project Information
This form shall be completed by all organizations (both primes and proposed
subcontractors).
• Representation Under DoD Assistance Agreements: Appropriations Provisions on
Tax Delinquency and Felony Convictions
Note: The Estimated Cost Breakdown Template in Section H.10 replaces the requirement
for the Summary Proposal Budget (ARO Form 99)
Volume 2 – Cost Proposal
Below are the outlines of the informational requirements for a cost proposal.
Cost Proposal – (No Page Limit). The cost proposal shall contain sufficient factual information to
establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project, the perception of project risks, the ability to
organize and perform the work, and to support the realism and reasonableness of the proposed 
40
work, to the extent appropriate. The Government recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may
motivate offerors to offer low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with
junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture. The Government discourages such
cost strategies. Cost reduction approaches that shall be received favorably include innovative
management concepts that maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds
into overhead.
Reasoning for Submitting a Strong Cost Proposal
The ultimate responsibility of the Contracting Officer is to ensure that all prices offered in a
proposal are fair and reasonable before contract award [FAR 15.4]. To establish the
reasonableness of the offered prices, the Contracting Officer may ask the offeror to provide various
supporting documentation that assists in this determination. The offeror’s ability to be responsive
to the Contracting Officer’s requests can expedite contract award. As specified in Section 808 of
Public Law 105-261, an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit information
for a contract or subcontract in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of FAR 15.403-3 may be
ineligible for award.
DCAA-Accepted Accounting System
Before a contract can be awarded, the Contracting Officer must confirm that the offeror has a
DCAA-accepted accounting system in place for accumulating and billing costs under Government
contracts [FAR 53.209-1(f)]. If the offeror has DCAA correspondence, which documents the
acceptance of their accounting system, this should be provided to the Contracting Officer (i.e.,
attached or referenced in the proposal). Otherwise, the Contracting Officer will submit an inquiry
directly to the appropriate DCAA office and request a review of the offeror’s accounting system.
If an offeror does not have a DCAA-accepted accounting system in place, the DCAA review
process can take several months depending upon the availability of the DCAA auditors and the
offeror’s internal processes. This will cause a delay in contract award.
For more information about cost proposals and accounting standards, view the link titled
“Information for Contractors” on their website at: https://www.dcaa.mil/Guidance/Audit-ProcessOverview/.
Field Pricing Assistance
During the pre-award cost audit process, the Contracting Officer will solicit support from DCAA
to determine commerciality and price reasonableness of the proposal [FAR 15.404-2]. Any
proprietary information or reports obtained from DCAA field audits will be appropriately
identified and protected within the Government.

B. Section 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown
Each proposal must contain a budget for each Program Phase of support requested and a
cumulative budget for the full term of requested support. Locally produced versions may
be used, but you may not make substitutions in prescribed budget categories or alter or
rearrange the cost categories as they appear on the form. The proposal may request funds
under any of the categories listed so long as the item is considered necessary to perform
the proposed work and is not precluded by applicable cost principles. Additionally, a
budget by major proposed research tasks and sub-task using the same budget categories
must be included. An example is provided in Section II.H.
42
All cost data must be current and complete. Costs proposed must conform
to the following principles and procedures:
Educational Institutions: 2 CFR Part 200 (formerly OMB Circular A-21)
Nonprofit Organizations: 2 CFR Part 200 (formerly OMB Circular A-122*); and
Commercial Organizations: FAR Part 31, DFARS Part 231, FAR Subsection
15.403-5, and DFARS Subsection 215.403-5.
*For those nonprofit organizations specifically exempt from the provisions of 2 CFR
Part 230, FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 231 shall apply.
Offerors shall submit numerical cost and pricing data using Microsoft Excel. The Excel
document, in the format provided in Section II.H, shall include intact formulas and shall
not be hard numbered. The base and option period cost data should roll up into a total cost
summary. The Excel files may be write-protected but shall not be password protected. The
Cost/Price Volume shall include the following:
i. Completed Cost/Price Template - Offerors shall submit a cost element breakdown
for the base period, each option period and the total program summary in the format
provided in Section II.H.
ii. Total cost broken down by major task.
iii. Major program tasks by fiscal year.
iv. A summary of projected funding requirements by month.
v. A summary table listing all labor categories used in the proposal and their
associated direct labor rates, along with escalation factors used for each base year
and option year.
vi. A summary table listing all indirect rates used in the proposal for each base year
and option year
Additional details regarding the cost proposal, including samples tables, can be found
further in this section.
C. Section 3: Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in
sufficient detail to substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the
basis of estimate (BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting
documentation, as applicable.
A signed summary budget page must be included. The documentation pages should be
titled "Budget Explanation Page" and numbered chronologically starting with the
budget form. The need for each item should be explained clearly.
Sample Elements of a Cost Proposal
To help guide offerors through the pre-award cost audit process, a sample cost proposal is detailed
below. This sample also allows the offeror to see exactly what the Government is looking for;
therefore, all cost and pricing back-up data can be provided to the Government in the first cost 
43
proposal submission. Review each cost element within the proposal and take note of the types of
documentation that the Contracting Officer will require from the offeror.
A. Direct Labor
The first cost element included in the cost proposal is Direct Labor. The DoD requires each
proposed employee to be listed by name and labor category.
Table 5: Example of Direct Labor Table Proposed by Sample Offeror

Subtotal Direct Labor (DL) $97,280.00 $100,198.40
For this cost element, the Contracting Officer requires the offeror to provide adequate
documentation in order to determine that each labor rate for each employee/labor category is
fair and reasonable. The documentation will need to explain how these labor rates were
derived. For example, if the rates are DCAA-approved labor rates, provide the Contracting
Officer with copies of the DCAA documents stating the approval. This is the most acceptable
means of documentation to determine the rates fair and reasonable. Other types of supporting
documentation may include General Service Administration (GSA) contract price lists, actual
payroll journals, or Salary.com research. If an employee listed in a cost proposal is not a current
employee (maybe a new employee, or one contingent upon the award of this contract), a copy
of the offer letter stating the hourly rate - signed and accepted by the employee - may be
provided as adequate documentation. Sometimes the hourly rates listed in a proposal are
derived through subjective processes, i.e., blending of multiple employees in one labor
category, or averaged over the course of the year to include scheduled payroll increases, etc.
These situations should be clearly documented for the Contracting Officer.
Another cost element in Direct Labor is labor escalation, or the increase in labor rates from
Year 1 to Year 2. In the example above, the proposed labor escalation is 3% (ex., Andy Smith
increased from $55.00/hr in Year 1, by 3% to $56.65/hr in Year 2). Often times, an offeror
may not propose escalation on labor rates during a 24-month period. Whatever the proposed
escalation rate is, please be prepared to explain why it is fair and reasonable [ex., a sufficient
explanation for our sample escalation rate would be the Government’s General Schedule 
44
Increase and Locality Pay for the same time period (name FY) in the same location (name
location) was published as 3.5%, therefore a 3% increase is fair and reasonable]
B. Other Direct Costs (ODCs)
This section of the cost proposal includes all other directly related costs required in support of
the effort, i.e., materials, subcontractors, consultants, travel, etc. Any cost element that includes
various items will need to be detailed in a cost breakdown to the Contracting Officer.
Direct Material Costs: This subsection of the cost proposal will include any special tooling,
test equipment, and material costs necessary to perform the project. Items included in this
section will be carefully reviewed relative to need and appropriateness for the work proposed,
and must, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, be advantageous to the Government and
directly related to the specific topic.
The Contracting Officer will require adequate documentation from the offeror to determine the
cost reasonableness for each material cost proposed. The following methods are ways in
which the Contracting Officer can determine this [FAR 15.403-1].
• Adequate Price Competition. A price is based on adequate price competition when the
offeror solicits and receives quotes from two or more responsible vendors for the same
or similar items or services. Based on these quotes, the offeror selects the vendor who
represents the best value to the Government. The offeror will be required to provide
copies of all vendor quotes received to the Contracting Officer. Note: Price
competition is not required for items at or below the micropurchase threshold ($10,000)
[FAR 15.403-1]. If an item’s unit cost is less than or equal to $10,000, price
competition is not necessary. However, if an item’s total cost over the period of
performance (unit cost * quantity is higher than $10,000, two or more quotes must be
obtained by the offeror.
• Commercial Prices. Commercial prices are those published on current price lists,
catalogs, or market prices. This includes vendors who have prices published on a GSAschedule contract. The offeror will be required to provide copies of such price lists to
the Contracting Officer.
• Prices set by law or regulation. If a price is mandated by the Government (i.e.
pronouncements in the form of periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a
governmental body, or embodied in the laws) that is sufficient to set a price.
Table 6: Example of Direct Material Costs as Proposed by Sample Offeror
DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS: YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Raw Materials $35,000.00 $12,000.00
Computer for experiments $4,215.00 $0.00
Cable (item #12-3657, 300 ft) $1,275.00 $0.00
45
DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS: YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Software $1,825.00 $1,825.00
Subtotal Direct Materials Costs (DM): $42,315.00 $13,825.00
Raw Materials: This is a generic label used to group many material items into one cost item
within the proposal. The Contracts Officer will require a detailed breakout of all the items that
make up this cost. For each separate item over $10,000 (total for Year 1 + Year 2), the offeror
must be able to provide either competitive quotes received, or show that published pricing was
used.
Computer for experiments: Again, this item is most likely a grouping of several components
that make up one system. The Contracts Officer will require a detailed breakout of all the
items that make up this cost. For each separate item over $10,000 (total for Year 1 + Year 2),
the offeror must be able to provide either competitive quotes received, or show that published
pricing was used.
Cable: Since this item is under the simplified acquisition threshold of $10,000, competitive
quotes or published pricing are not required. Simply provide documentation to show the
Contracting Officer where this price came from.
Software: This cost item could include either one software product, or multiple products. If
this includes a price for multiple items, please provide the detailed cost breakdown. Note: The
price for Year 1 ($1,825) is below the simplified acquisition threshold; however, in total (Year
1 + Year 2) the price is over $10,000, so competitive quotes or published pricing
documentation must be provided.
Due to the specialized types of products and services necessary to perform these projects, it
may not always be possible to obtain competitive quotes from more than one reliable source.
Each cost element over the simplified acquisition threshold ($10,000) must be substantiated.
There is always an explanation for HOW the cost of an item was derived; show us how you
came up with that price!
When it is not possible for an offeror to obtain a vendor price through competitive quotes or
published price lists, a Contracting Officer may accept other methods to determine cost
reasonableness. Below are some examples of other documentation, which the Contracting
Officer may accept to substantiate costs:
a. Evidence that a vendor/supplier charged another offeror a similar price for similar
services. Has the vendor charged someone else for the same product? (Two (2) to three
(3) invoices from that vendor to different customers may be used as evidence.)
b. Previous contract prices. Has the offeror charged the Government a similar price under
another Government contract for similar services? If the Government has already paid
a certain price for services, then that price may already be considered fair and
reasonable. (Provide the contract number, and billing rates for reference.) 
46
c. DCAA approved. Has DCAA already accepted or verified specific cost items included
in your proposal? (Provide a copy of DCAA correspondence that addressed these
costs.)
Table 7: Example of ODCs, Including Equipment, as Proposed by Example Offeror
OTHER DIRECT COSTS: YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Equipment Rental for Analysis $5,500.00 $5,600.00
Subcontractor – Widget, Inc. $25,000.00 $0.00
Consultant: John Bowers $0.00 $12,000.00
Travel $1,250.00 $1,250.00
Subtotal ODCs: $31,750.00 $18,850.00
Equipment Rental for Analysis: The offeror explains that the Year 1 cost of $5,500 is based
upon 250 hours of equipment rental at an hourly rate of $22.00/hr. One (1) invoice from the
vendor charging another vendor the same price for the same service is provided to the
Contracting Officer as evidence.
Subcontractor – Widget, Inc.: The offeror provides a copy of the subcontractor quote to the
Contracting Officer in support of the $25,000 cost. This subcontractor quote must include
sufficient detailed information (equivalent to the data included in the prime’s proposal to the
Government), so that the Contracting Officer can make a determination of cost reasonableness.
a. As stated in Section 3.5(c)(6) of the DoD Cost Proposal guidance, “All subcontractor
costs and consultant costs must be detailed at the same level as prime contractor costs
in regards to labor, travel, equipment, etc. Provide detailed substantiation of
subcontractor costs in your cost proposal.”
b. In accordance with FAR 15.404-3, “the Contracting Officer is responsible for the
determination of price reasonableness for the prime contract, including subcontracting
costs”. This means that the subcontractor’s quote/proposal may be subject to the same
scrutiny by the Contracting Officer as the cost proposal submitted by the prime. The
Contracting Officer will need to determine whether the subcontractor has an accepted
purchasing system in place and/or conduct appropriate cost or price analyses to
establish the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices. Due to the proprietary
nature of cost data, the Subcontractor may choose to submit their pricing information
directly to the Contracting Officer and not through the prime. This is understood and
encouraged.
c. When a subcontractor is selected to provide support under the prime contract due to
their specialized experience, the Contracting Officer may request sole source
justification from the offeror.
Consultant – John Bowers: Again, the offeror shall provide a copy of the consultant’s quote
to the Contracting Officer as evidence. In this example, the consultant will be charging an
hourly rate of $125 an hour for 96 hours of support. The offeror indicates to the Contracting
Officer that this particular consultant was used on a previous contract with the Government
(provide contract number), and will be charging the same rate. A copy of the consultant’s 
47
invoice to the offeror under the prior contract is available as supporting evidence. Since the
Government has paid this price for the same services in the past, determination has already
been made that the price is fair.
Travel: The Contracting Officer will require a detailed cost breakdown for travel expenses to
determine whether the total cost is reasonable based on Government per diem and mileage
rates. This breakdown shall include the number of trips, the destinations, and the number of
travelers. It will also need to include the estimated airfare per round trip, estimated car rental,
lodging rate per trip, tax on lodging, and per diem rate per trip. The lodging and per diem rates
must coincide with the Joint Travel Regulations. Please see the following website to determine
the appropriate lodging and per diem rates: https://www.travel.dod.mil/. Additionally, the
offeror must provide why the airfare is fair and reasonable as well. Sufficient back up for both
airfare and car rental would include print outs of online research at the various travel search
engines (Expedia, Travelocity, etc.) documenting the prices for airfare and car rentals thus
proving why your chosen rate is fair and reasonable.
Table 8: Example of Travel Cost Breakout from ODCs by Example Offeror
TRAVEL Trips Travelers Nights Days Unit Cost Total

Airfare per
roundtrip 1 1 $996.00 $996.00
Lodging per day 1 1 1 $75.00 $75.00

(12%)
per day 1 1 1 $9.00 $9.00
Per Diem per day 1 1 2 $44.00 $88.00
Automobile
Rental per day 1 1 2 $41.00 $82.00
Subtotal
Travel $1,250.00
C. Indirect Rates
Indirect rates include elements such as Fringe Benefits, General & Administrative (G&A), Overhead,
and Material Handling costs. The offeror shall indicate in the cost proposal both the indirect rates (as
a percentage) as well as how those rates are allocated to the costs in the proposal.
Table 9: Example of Indirect Rates by Example Offeror
INDIRECTS YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Subtotal Direct Labor (DL): $97,280.00 $100,198.40
Fringe Benefits, if not included in Overhead, rate
(15.0000 %) X DL =
$14,592.00 $15,029.76
Labor Overhead (rate 45.0000 %) X (DL + Fringe) = $50,342.40 $51,852.67
Total Direct Labor (TDL): $162,214.40 $167,080.83
48
In this example, the offeror includes a Fringe Benefit rate of 15.00% that it allocated to the
Direct Labor costs. They also propose a Labor Overhead rate of 45.00% that is allocated to the
Direct Labor costs plus the Fringe Benefits.
All indirect rates and the allocation methods of those rates must be verified by the Contracting
Officer. In most cases, DCAA documentation supporting the indirect rates and allocation
methods can be obtained through a DCAA field audit or proposal review. Many offerors have
already completed such reviews and have this documentation readily available. If an offeror is
unable to participate in a DCAA review to substantiate indirect rates, the Contracting Officer
may request other accounting data from the offeror to make a determination.
D. Cost of Money (COM)
If Cost of Money (an imputed cost that is not a form of interest on borrowings (see FAR
31.205-20); an “incurred cost” for cost-reimbursement purposes under applicable costreimbursement contracts and for progress payment purposes under fixed-price contracts; and
refers to: (1) Facilities capital cost of money (48 CFR 9904.414); and (2) Cost of money as an
element of the cost of capital assets under construction (48 CFR 9904.417)) is proposed in
accordance with FAR 31.205-10, a DD Form 1861 is required to be completed and submitted
with the contractor’s proposal.
E. Fee/Profit
The proposed fee percentage will be analyzed in accordance with DFARS 215.404, the
Weighted Guidelines Method.
3. Submission of Complete Research Proposals
Proposals must be submitted through the offeror’s organizational office having responsibility
for Government business relations. All signatures must be that of an official authorized to
commit the organization in business and financial affairs. Proposals must be submitted
electronically using the following format:
Proposals shall be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation
System (IDEAS). Offerors interested in providing a submission in response to this BAA shall
first register by electronic means in accordance with the instructions provided on the
following web site: https://iarpa-ideas.gov. Offerors who plan to submit proposals for
evaluation are strongly encouraged to register at least one week prior to the due date for the
first round of proposals. Offerors who do not register in advance do so at their own risk, and
the Government shall not extend the due date to accommodate such Offerors. Failure to
register as stated shall prevent the Proposer’s submittal of documents.
After registration has been approved, Offeror’s should upload a proposal, scanned
certifications and permitted additional information in ‘pdf’ format, or as otherwise directed
(Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). Offerors are responsible for ensuring a compliant and timely
submission of their proposals to meet the BAA submittal deadlines. Time management to 
49
upload and submit is wholly the responsibility of the Offeror. Note: IDEAS will require
Offerors to complete a proposal cover sheet within IDEAS at the time that the Volume 1
– Technical and Management Proposal is submitted. This is separate and distinct from
the Technical and Cost Volume cover sheets referenced in II.D.2 (also provided in Section
H). Information requested within IDEAS will include basic cost information (Total funds
requested from IARPA, proposed costs by option period and validity period).
Upon completing the proposal submission, the Offeror shall receive an automated
confirmation email from IDEAS. Please forward that automated message to dni-iarpa-baaw911nf-23-s-0007@iarpa.gov. The Government strongly suggests that the Offeror document
the submission of their proposal package by printing the electronic receipt (time and date
stamped) that appears on the final screen following compliant submission of a proposal to the
IDEAS website.
Proposals submitted by any means other than IDEAS (e.g., hand-carried, postal service,
commercial carrier and email) shall not be considered unless the Offeror attempted electronic
submittal but was unsuccessful and notified the Government using the following procedure.
The Offeror shall send an e-mail to dni-iarpa-baa-w911nf-23-s-0007@iarpa.gov prior to the
proposal due date and time specified in the BAA and indicate that an attempt was made to
submit electronically, and that the submittal was unsuccessful. This e-mail shall include
contact information for the Offeror. Upon receipt of such notification, the Government will
provide additional guidance regarding submission.
The full proposal submission shall be submitted by the date and time specified in the BAA,
Application and Submission Information section, II.D.4 Submission Dates and Times in
order to be considered. Proposals received after this date are deemed to be late and will not
be reviewed. Failure to comply with the submission procedures may result in the submittal
not being evaluated.
All information uploaded into IDEAS shall be unclassified. Classified information is not
permitted.
4. Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)
Each applicant (unless the applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is exempt
from those requirements under 2 CFR §25.110(b) or (c), or has an exception approved by the
Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR §25.110(d)) is required to:
(i) Be registered in SAM before submitting its application;
(ii) Provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application; and
(iii) Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times
during which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration
by a Federal awarding agency.
The Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award to an applicant until the applicant
has complied with all applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements. If an applicant
has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the Federal awarding agency is ready 
50
to make a Federal award, the Federal awarding agency may determine that the applicant is not
qualified to receive a Federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a Federal
award to another applicant.
4. Submission Dates and Times:
Proposals:
Proposals transmitted to be considered for award must be submitted in IDEAS no later than
5:00 PM EDT on 8 MAY 2023.
Applicants are responsible for submitting electronic proposals in sufficient time to insure
IARPA IDEAS receives it by the time specified in this BAA. If the electronic proposal is
received by IARPA IDEAS after the exact time and date specified for receipt of offers, it will
be considered “late” and may not be considered for award. Acceptable evidence to establish
the time of receipt by IARPA IDEAS includes documentary evidence of receipt maintained by
IARPA IDEAS.
Because of potential problems involving the applicants’ own equipment, to avoid the
possibility of late receipt and resulting in ineligibility for award consideration, it is
strongly recommended that proposals be uploaded at least two business days before the
deadline established in the BAA.
If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that
proposals cannot be received at IARPA IDEAS by the exact time specified in the solicitation,
and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation closing date, the
time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day
specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes
resume.
Proposal Receipt Notices – The Government will receive an email confirming the successful
submission of a proposal to IARPA IDEAS within one (1) hour after submission, as long as
the proposal is submitted no later than 5 PM EDT on the due date.
5. Intergovernmental Review:
Other Government Agencies will be involved in the review process.
6. Funding Restrictions:
Multiple 42-month awards are anticipated. The actual amount of each award will be contingent
on availability of funds and the scope of the proposed work. Depending on the results of the
proposal evaluation, there is no guarantee that any of the proposals submitted in response to a
particular program goal will be recommended for funding. Proposals may be funded in part.
51
7. Other Submission Requirements:
Information to Be Requested from Successful Offerors - Offerors whose proposals are accepted
for funding will be contacted before award to provide additional information required for award.
The required information is normally limited to clarifying budget explanations, representations,
certifications, and some technical aspects.
Statement of Work (SOW) - prior to award the Contracting Officer may request that the contractor
submit an SOW for the effort to be performed, which will be incorporated into the contract at the
time of award.
An applicant may withdraw a proposal at any time before award by written notice or by email.
Notice of withdrawal shall be sent to the Contracting identified in Section II.G of this BAA.
Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting/Grants Officer.
E. Proposal Review Information:
1. Criteria:
The Government shall only review proposals against the evaluation criteria, and then against
program balance, and availability of funds, and shall not evaluate them against other proposals,
since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. For evaluation
purposes, a proposal is the document described in Section II.D.2.b of the BAA. Other supporting
or background materials submitted with the proposal shall not be considered. Only Government
personnel shall make evaluation and award determinations under this BAA
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this Program BAA are
described in the following paragraphs. Each proposal shall be evaluated on its own merits and its
relevance to the Program goals rather than against other proposals submitted in response to this
BAA. The proposals shall be evaluated based on technical, program, and funding availability
factors. These are of equal importance. Within the technical evaluation factor, the specific
technical criteria are in descending order of importance, as follows: Overall Scientific and
Technical Merit, Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan, Contribution and Relevance to the
IARPA Mission and Program Goal, Relevant Experience and Expertise, and Resource Realism.
Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided below.
Award(s) shall be made to an offeror on the basis of the technical, program, and funding
availability factors listed below, and subject to successful negotiations with the Government.
Offerors are cautioned that failure to follow submittal instructions may negatively impact their
proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal is substantiated, including unique and
innovative methods, approaches, and/or concepts. The offeror clearly articulates an understanding
of the problem to be solved. The technical approach is credible and includes a clear assessment of
primary risks and a means to address them. The proposed research advances the state-of-the-art.
52
Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan
The feasibility and likelihood that the proposed approach shall satisfy the Program’s milestones
and metrics are explicitly described and clearly substantiated along with risk mitigation strategies
for achieving stated milestones and metrics. The proposal reflects a mature and quantitative
understanding of the Program milestones and metrics, and the statistical confidence with which
they may be measured. Any offeror-proposed milestones and metrics are clear and well-defined,
with a logical connection to enabling offeror decisions and/or Government decisions. The schedule
to achieve the milestones is realistic and reasonable.
The roles and relationships of prime and sub-contractors is clearly delineated with all participants
fully documented. Work plans shall demonstrate the ability to provide full Government visibility
into and interaction with key technical activities and personnel, and a single point of responsibility
for contract performance. Work plans shall also demonstrate that key personnel have sufficient
time committed to the Program to accomplish their described Program roles.
The requirement and rationale for and the anticipated use or integration of Government resources,
including, but not limited to, all equipment, facilities, information, etc., is fully described including
dates when such Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Equipment
(GFE), Government Furnished Information (GFI) or other similar Government-provided resources
shall be required.
The offeror’s RDMP is complete, addressing the types of data to be collected or produced,
describing how each type of data will be preserved and shared, including plans to provide public
access to peer reviewed publications and the underlying research data, or provides justifiable
rationale for not making this data available.
Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA and ARO Mission and Program Goals
The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated program goals and all elements
within the proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The offeror clearly
addresses how the proposed effort shall meet and progressively demonstrate the Program goals.
The offeror describes how the proposed solution contributes to IARPA’s mission to invest in highrisk/high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with an overwhelming intelligence advantage.
The offeror’s proposed intellectual property and data rights are consistent with the Government’s
need to be able to effectively manage the program and evaluate the technical output and
deliverables, communicate program information across Government organizations and support
transition and further use and development of the program results to Intelligence Community users
at an acceptable cost. The proposed approach to intellectual property rights is in the Government’s
best interest.

transition and further use and development of the program results to Intelligence Community users
at an acceptable cost. The proposed approach to intellectual property rights is in the Government’s
best interest. 
53
Relevant Experience and Expertise
The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of
these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal's objectives as well as qualifications,
capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and key personnel
critical in achieving the proposal objectives. Time commitments of key personnel must be
sufficient for their proposed responsibilities in the effort.
Resource Realism
The proposed resources demonstrate a clear understanding of the program, a perception of the risks
and the ability to organize and perform the work. The labor hours and mix are consistent with the
technical and management proposal and are realistic for the work proposed. Material, equipment,
software, data collection and management, and travel, especially foreign travel, are well justified,
reasonable, and required for successful execution of the proposed work.
Program Balance
The Government will consider IARPA’s overall mission and program objectives, which may
include but are not limited to the following: broadening the variety of technical approaches to
enhance program outcomes, transitioning the technology to Government partners, developing
capabilities aligned with the priorities of the IC and national security.
Funding Availability Factor
Budget Constraints: The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting program
objectives within program budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts.
Note: If the Offeror has submitted the proposal to other federal, state or local agencies or other
parties that may fund the proposed effort, it may impact the Government’s decision to fund the
effort.
2. Review and Selection Process:
The Government conducts impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal reviews to select the
source (or sources) whose offer meets the Government's technical, policy and programmatic
goals. For evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in Section D of the BAA.
Other supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal shall not be considered.
The contract award process for this BAA has two steps. The first step is selection for
negotiations and is made based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors (see BAA
Section II.E.1). The second step is negotiation and contract award. The Government’s decision to
negotiate with any one offeror is solely at the Government’s discretion. That negotiation may
not be offered to other offerors. Contract award is contingent on Contracting Officer’s
determination of a fair and reasonable cost/price and agreement on terms and conditions.
Selection for negotiation will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process led by the
REASON IARPA Program Manager (PM). This process entails establishing a Scientific Review
Panel (SRP) made up of qualified Government personnel who will review and assess each
proposal’s strengths, weaknesses and risks against the technical evaluation criteria. If necessary, 
54
non-Government technical experts with specialized expertise may advise Government panel
members and the PM. However, only Government personnel will make selection
recommendations and decisions under this BAA.
Proposals will be reviewed individually and will not be compared against each other as they are
not submitted in accordance with a common SOW. When SRP reviews are complete, the IARPA
PM will prepare a recommendation to the IARPA Scientific Review Official (SRO) identifying
proposals as recommended, recommended with modifications, or not recommended for
negotiation based on consideration of all stated factors in Section II.E.1 (technical, program
balance, and funding availability factors). The SRO will make the final decision as to selection
for negotiations. At this point, Offerors will be notified in writing by the Contracting Officer as
to whether or not they have been selected for negotiation.
NOTE: A proposal may be handled for administrative purposes by support contractors. These
support contractors are prohibited from competing on BAA proposals and are bound by
appropriate non-disclosure requirements.
The Government may use Non-Government contractors who are employees of Booz Allen
Hamilton, Whitney, Bradley & Brown, Inc. (WBB), Serco, Inc., Airlin Technologies, Bluemont
Technology and Research, Navstar, Crimson Phoenix, Northwood Global Solutions, Onts &
Quants, Inc., or Tarragon Solutions to provide expert advice regarding portions of the proposals
submitted to the Government and to provide logistical support in carrying out the evaluation
process. In addition to supporting evaluations, the following entities: Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics Laboratory and MITRE Corporation will be supporting T&E activities for contracts
awarded under this program and should be considered as part of an Offeror’s OCI disclosure.
These personnel shall have signed and are subject to the terms and conditions of non-disclosure
agreements. By submission of its proposal, an offeror agrees that its proposal information may be
disclosed to employees of these organizations for the limited purpose stated above. Offerors who
object to this arrangement shall provide clear notice of their objection as part of their transmittal
letter. If offerors do not send notice of objection to this arrangement in their transmittal letter, the
Government shall assume consent to the use of contractor support personnel in assisting the review
of submittal(s) under this BAA.
Only Government personnel shall make evaluation and award determinations under this BAA.
