2. **Advisory Board Meetings**: The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Advisory Board holds open meetings to discuss program strategies and developments. The most recent meeting was scheduled for March 5-6, 2024[7].

3. **Ongoing Center Competitions**: NIST MEP continues to hold competitions for MEP Center operations in various states. For example, a recent notice of funding opportunity was announced for the Florida MEP Center, with anticipated funding of $5,319,200 per year for up to five years[6].

4. **Response to Challenges**: The MEP National Network has been actively working with state and federal governments to respond to unprecedented challenges, particularly in light of recent global events affecting manufacturing[8].

5. **Emphasis on Partnerships**: MEP Centers continue to serve as hubs for manufacturers, connecting them with government agencies, trade associations, universities, research laboratories, and other resources to foster growth and innovation[8].

## Conclusion

The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program continues to play a vital role in supporting and strengthening U.S. manufacturing, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Through its extensive network of centers and experts, MEP provides crucial services in areas such as technology adoption, workforce development, and supply chain integration. The program's strong return on investment and significant economic impacts demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing on both national and global scales.

Industry 4.0 Technologies Help Manufacturers SucceedIndustry 4.0 Technologies Help Manufacturers Succeed
In today’s labor market, manufacturers continue to struggle to find quality labor. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies can help manufacturers fill those gaps, improve efficiency, and stay competitive. The shift toward automation is a reason many manufacturers decide to work with an MEP Center. MEP Centers have a broad range of subject matter experts that can help companies, whether they’re just learning about I4.0 or are already implementing it. This video features MEP manufacturing clients discussing their company’s experience with I4.0. In addition, MEP Center experts explain some of the benefits they’ve seen for their clients.
