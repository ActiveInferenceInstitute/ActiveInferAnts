Inês Hipólito ~ Active Inference Insights 004 ~ Markov Blankets, Modularity, Enactivism

welcome everybody to the fourth episode of active inference insights I'm your host Daris Pary Wayne and today I have
the pleasure of Hosting inz hippolito inz is a lecture of philosophy of artificial intelligence and mqu
University in Australia our research focuses on 4E cognition which holds that cognition is embodied embedded enacted
and extended beyond the brain and she studies how this framework can help us understand and build other systems that
exhibit a form of augmented Mission including brain computer interfaces neurot Technologies and smart
environments in addition to this she co-founded the international Society of the philosophy of the Sciences of the
mind with gutier picini and she is currently the ethics uh ethics advisor
um in artificial intelligence versus the cognitive Computing company which
implements active inference into artificial intelligence agents um inz
thank you so much for joining me it's an absolute pleasure thank you so much for having me uh the pleasure is mine and
it's um we were just discussing off a that you know we're doing this across
many oceans so Nez is in Australia I'm in London um but we managed to sync it up which is which is fantastic exent so
I wanted to start with markof blankets um all things start with Mar
Markov blankets um Mark of blankets really play a fundamental role in active
and in the framework that we apply to artificial intelligence to cognition more generally and also just the
underlying physics and math of back to inference and a lot of your work has focused on Mark of blankets and the
scaling up of Mark of blankets so maybe a good place to start for our audience would be if you could just give a simple
overview of exactly what a mark of blanket is and then we can go from that yeah fantastic uh yeah you're absolutely
right when you say that everything starts with the mark of blanket everything that is a thing um is has got
a mark of blanket and that does not necessarily mean um that a mark of
blanket is going to correspond to a certain kind of like physical boundary that one can see uh right a mark of
blanket um is a theoretical formal construct that what it does is it tells
you um how or what things are going to be influencing a certain state to be the
case right so it's it is a statistical Tool uh precisely to understand
something really important uh which is how a certain thing is coupled with
within or with its environment um so everything does start everything has its
markco blanket does start with the markco blanket because it is a way in which we can
capture two very important aspects um and these two aspects um are that um a
thing um typically an open system as the thing um is um both thermodynamically
open and operationally closed so this is quite crucial um because it is what
allows the thing um to persist not to perish not to succumb to the second law
of Thermodynamics so Mark of blanket is really become uh very useful because to
my understanding um they allow us to capture simultaneously these two
features being both operationally open oh sorry operationally closed and
thermodynamically open because what happens is the system is situated in the environment in a way that it is open to
the environment it must be coupled with the environment otherwise it is uh perishing um it will not maintain itself
but it also has a certain boundary that allows it to maintain its coherent for
so the markco blankets become really interesting because they allow us to capture those two dimensions of um an
open system and what is an open system an open system is mostly everything that we see uh we don't really come across uh
closed systems excellent yeah that's great um I'm wondering whether you could give us
a sort of overview of exactly how that coupling works so people may have seen that the mark of blanket is essentially
composed of active States and sensory States um that makes sense if yet if
we're talking kind of about physical boundaries like actuators arms legs and so on but on the understanding The Mark
of blanket is a statistical entity what does um what what what
really are active States and sensory States um in the theoretical way well
there are many ways to answer this question um it will depend on how much you want to connect um then the active
inference framework and formalism uh with other uh theories that we find in
physics or in Neuroscience uh so there are many different ways in which one can
answer um this question um but for the sake of remaining um with the kind of
like more scale-free application of markco blankets and not reducing to
immediately uh to the brain um I will uh keep the formalism as something that we
can apply to understand the statistical relations or
influences um between a system an open system and its environment um right so
then what you have is you have the possibility of understanding how a
certain system is in a particular state so you understand that and then and then
what you can also understand is you can make predictions about future States in which you may find the system by virtue
of using this kind of for formulas right uh so then what you have is you employ
or Define that the level or aspects um of scientific interest are going to be
your internal States right and then your next question is going to be okay how do
I find this system in this PR in this precise uh time and space in these
particular States what are the the the the states uh in which the system is
situated that are going to be crucial for me to find the system in this
particular State and therefore I understand um the system and potentially ideally I can make some uh nice
predictions about future States so this will be our internal States so then what
we need to we need to get on is then we need to get to Define what are the external States and those are like I
said the states that are going to be influential uh for immediately influential for um the system to be in a
specific kind of like internal States now this is all done the next step is to
understand that internal and external States they mutually influence one
another that's what it means about something being an open system right is that there is exchange of mattera and
energy such that the system is remaining in a certain State and for example is
not um going into into a face space um uh such as like perishing or or towards
um towards uh death um so then um what what you get is an understanding of um
what I was just saying which is how the system is coupled and in this permanent
um continuous exchange of matter and energy in order to remain
alive and push back on the second LA themodynamics right so you get this
operationally closed and open system at the same time that is uh very well captured by these internal and external
States and I did say that uh they influence one another but it is important um to
understand that they do not directly influence one another they need a second set of States um so basically internal
and external states are conditionally in opin it and they will require the intervention of a second um set of
states which is very much what you asked uh the active and sensory States right
so these are going to be the ones that are doing the direct communication if
you will between each other where um hopefully and ideally we have um a
balanced influence between sensory and active States right and these um direct
influences between um sensory and active states are going to play a crucial role
in order for us to mathematically trap down and understand the coupling of the
system in the environment which is the system being internal States the environment being external States so
this is just like the overview of uh the mark of blanket and the active inference
formalism that we could apply to anything that is an open system wonderful yeah that's great
that's a really useful explication of the framework um I think it's as I kind
of hinted to in my initial question it's it's rather easy to think of it as a physical boundary so we can think of
cell boundaries or the blood Bane barrier or the boundaries of my body and
then when we do that the notion of sense reactive States really becomes intuitive
in the sense that in the case of my body all it is is an action perception Loop and that's being known to be critical to
intelligence or cognition for a very long time so that said there's also a very strong
position which is that it's actually just a statistical description of the way things act the way things persist
through time that leads me to ask the question of should we consider the markco blanket to be in uh interpreted
in an instrumentalist way in the sense that it's kind of a way it's a tool that we can use in modeling objects open
systems or is it or should we be inter in it in a realistic way I.E there is
actually something uh that is ontologically a mark of blanket that is
truly out there as a markco blanket um embedded within lots of other markco
blankets of course yes I'm really glad that you ask that uh question it's a Live question um and um there are many
ways to answer um this question so the way that I that I that I that I decided
to answer the previous question was was in a way that one understands that um a
mark of blanket is a tool is a statistical tool it's a formalism it's a
mathematical construct right and I also did not go immediately
into the brain uh or an organism with actions and Sensations because I'm
trying to avoid uh precisely um the literature that tends to reduce the
framework to thinking that active States and sensory states are going to be
action and sensation right that is not the case right um so a mark of blanket formalism
from active inference can be applyed to anything that is an open system and there are many um examples of this in
the literature such as for example I can think of um the example of when you have
a set of um of pendulums in a room or a set of clocks in the same room what's
going to happen is uh that eventually they will synchronize right and you can use this framework to capture to predict
that synchronization right so it is important to understand that this is a mathematical construct that you can
employ to precisely understand patterns of behavior in the natural world right
so we've done that um we understood that so then we can think about it you can
use this uh framework to develop for example simulation models which allow you to understand the phenomenon of
scientific interest as well as hopefully it's a good model is going to give you some prediction power over future states
of the thing which doesn't have to be uh anything to do with cognition can be something um uh that is situated in the
natural world right then a certain phenomenon happens specifically in
cognitive science when we notice that specifically in cognitive science even
if you apply a certain computational framework doesn't have to be active
inference a certain computational framework is applied to model simulate
for ex and get some predictive power about for example black holes let's say
black holes right uh and they use that kind of like mathematical framework and then you employ the same
kind of mathematical framework the same kind of like ationalism to understand the brain because after all both a black
hole and uh a brain are complex systems what does that mean it means that it is
extremely difficult for us to model it why is it extremely difficult to model it because it is very high in dimension
so it's really hard for us we don't have the computational power to to model it which is why we need to incorporate
something called uh dimensionality reduction because we don't have the tractability to to Pro precisely do that
now keeping up with what what I was saying in cognitive science specifically a phenomenon happens so
imagine this we use the same computational um strategy to model
things from the natural world all the way to the brain right and then what
happens is that we would never say that the brain had sorry that the the the
black hole or something that is not uh part of uh a living system would have uh
specifically a mark of blanket or would engage in literally active inference we
would understand very clearly that this is computational strategy that we are developing and employing for epistemic
purposes to understand the phenomenon and to get some predictive power that's
what we're doing and we are happy with it if we get some predictive power that's success in science and then one once we do this
move and apply exactly the same formalisms into for example the brain or an organism right we tend to
anthropomorphize it right so we tend to say okay so then the brain is acting
precisely literally by engaging in active inference or in other uh Realms
engaging in predictive coding right so we lose track of understanding that okay
these were the tools that we started off with and we were very happy when we were modeling black holes with these tools we
were happy that we had some predictive power but now it's not enough we won't more well now we want to go from The
epistemic Virtue into an ontological predictor now we want to say that the
thing that we are modeling trying to understand developing um uh models for
epistemic gain is precisely has the properties or the ontological properties
that the model the computational model has right and that's when you get into
making a realist or taking a realist stance on and upon active influence
right you don't have to you can do it but then you're going to have to defend
that position in a way that okay you're going to have to answer so if you are if
you are applying the question that you need to answer then is if you're applying exactly the same framework to
model and predict black holes that you want to do the same with
brains do you get to say that brains engage literally in active inference in
ways that black holes don't and why so that's the realism take and the problems
that you find and what where you would uh be led to or you remain in the more
cautious kind of position which is on the instrumentalist or non-realist position in which case the position is
that all things in the world with with with the real existence right and those things
behave in ways that we would develop models to understand that behavior in
terms of patterns patterns of behavior the things exist in themselves
they interact with the world in themselves the patterns of behavior are
our scientific constructs so then we talk and then we can start talking about okay so I can
pattern behavior through for example employing developing a model on the
basis of Maco blankets active inference and then I pattern the behavior what did
I did what I did was I found patterns and therefore an explanation for a
Behavior Uh and this explanation is something that I didn't have before right right right right well I'm going
to take us towards some realist position now because I think people will find it interesting about the
the ontological claims ontological implications uh that act of inference has especially within the cognitive
science and the Neuroscience community and I guess when you're taking a real stance on the Markov blanket that there
are these structures which have some kind of um embedded nature in the brain right and and people have probably heard
frisen talk about how this is actually reflected in the phen phenotypic nature of the brain and its
hierarchies um it makes me think about modularity so mod it for people who
don't know was introduced by Jerry Fodor um in 1983 and the basic idea is that modules
are these kind of um innate neural structures which have kind of very specific functions and fdor in 83 laid
out sort of certain category certain functions that they a modular system
would have to um you know would have to obey by so domain specificity the fact
that modules have to operate on a very specific type of input um there's also
informational encapsulation this idea that like at least how he portrayed it in 1983 that these modules are
encapsulated with respect to high orderer beliefs that that notion got sort of you
know weakened over time let's say and then there were further about the actual neural architecture would have to be
involved in mod uh modules but anyway people can get the basic idea um of a module we might have a visual
module a hearing module a module for language right which would yeah which is
idea clearly taken up um or that tronsky found a lot of joy in um all that to say
what does active influence have to say about this picture of the Mind as being modular to any interesting degree and
does this notion of kind of at least for predictive coding position position a
hierarchy in which you have feedback loops in which the top down affects the bot the top layers affect the bottom
layers and vice versa does that actually really have anything to say about modularity and more generally the
architecture of the brain yes um well I'm really glad that you you're taking us there we do have um a couple of
papers that do um engage a little bit with uh the modularity of the Mind one
of them is Mark of blankets in the brain and that paper and the the one is parcels and particles um and um in there
we do briefly mention um reasons why thinking uh or patterning
the the brain Behavior the brain activity in terms of markco blankets would be useful for many reasons uh for
for for for applications that go all the way to DCM uh dynamical caal modeling in in Neuro Imaging but I'm going to set
that to the side and I'm going to specifically speak to uh the modularity of the mind you very well said um the
modularity of the mind is is one of the is one of those um theories that we've
been having in philosophy of mind that has been very foundational for cognitive science and for the ways in which we ask
questions for the ways in which we look for things in the brain um and has been
uh as influential as it has been refuted uh so very few people today I can think
of three people people uh that would endorse good old school fodorian modularity of the mind and there are re
there are philosophical reasons for that and there are scientific reasons for that philosophically uh there's been
made very substantial solid strong arguments against it and uh
scientifically um evidence shows neuroplasticity shows neural reuse in
ways that would contradict uh the modularity of the mind I will make here
just a recting of a little bit of history of philosophy of mind just um
before I get into U the active inference um understanding of um cognitive SLB
brain um activity and Dynamics just to say that it's interesting to see that we have this tendency so I'll do a little
bit of philosophy of Mind here we have been having this tendency in philosophy of mind or at least analytic philosophy
of mind um which is to look at and this is a point that has been made by many um
influential philosophers uh for example Francis Egan um she has made this very uh clever point and I
think she's absolutely right when uh we look into World philosophers of Mind look into what is happening in computer
science and then we adopt the best computer science at the time to
establish a kind of like a metaphor to how the mind supposedly work at the time
as you said in 83 uh Jerry F looked at um uh touring machines and in he and he
asked the question what would happen if one would conceive the mind as if it
were a touring machine and then he writes the book right what happened is
that what starts off as being like sort of like metaphorical thinking right it
eventually starts becoming a very ontological uh claim that the mind is
ontologically modular and that is very um it's very important for us to look
back in history so that we know what to do and what not to do in the future right because what happens is then you
set off cognitive science to look for those modules in the brain as you set up experiments as you set up uh uh uh
simulations computational simulations you set off to look for and find those very um then you have all of those sets
of properties that are supposed to be the model so there's the automaticity there's the domain specificity there's
there's the information encapsulation there's the top down information oh sorry uh the B
information going all the way up to cognition cognition mean so all of that framework that was a theoretical
framework adopted from computer science then is defining the whole cognitive
science field and what we should look for right so it's quite interesting and important for us to know our history to
know how things really happen in a way that well you look back and and you see how how it then science came back and
said well it kind of actually doesn't make sense that the mind is modular in that way uh so not only philosophically
we have refuted it and very u in ways that we have forced the modularity of
the mind to reinvent itself to revise itself to survive really and what
happened was um because the problems were coming to arise from philosophy and from from from Neuroscience what
happened was we started having to revise the modularity of the mind because the noveles were coming up but we did not
want to let go of the modularity of the mind so we start revising the basic pillars and then we start having to let
go of basic pillars and that's when you have massive modularity by petas for example and still um challenges continue
to come up right so then you start going into this other uh this other field
which was known at the time um cognitive penetrability so now what you allow is
you you you you revise modularity to the point that it's not just bottom up information going up but now you will
allow for bottom up and top down that's cognitive penetrability right and then it comes up um around
2010 and stays until 2020 still is a little bit here because as we um sort of
like um explored a little bit in a in a in a special issue that we we we just had out um this year with Michael kof
it's a special issue in Consciousness and cognition and it's about uh the bean brain and how whether how or whether uh
the visian brain predictive coding is compatible to the modularity of the mind
and specifically to uh the one that allows the this traffic going up and
down um such as uh cognitive penetrability and there are still um a
few people that um very are very engaged um in defending that kind of um of
modularity of the mind that is um quite um agreeable and comp comptible with
predictive coding and examples of that are for example more conservative um uh
approaches within U predictive processing theories of the mind for example the predictive mind prediction
error minimization uh mostly developed uh and headed by um by yakob Hui um that
would be one that um you can find as as as having some agreement with with
modularity of the mind of course the revised version of it which is uh the one in which uh it
is it allows traffic to go up and down and that's of course you can see the parallel as it being predictions coming
down prediction errors coming up and the traffic being very contentful in nature
therefore you have a version that it has got this compatibility between modularity of the mind and um and um and
the the predictive uh brain what happens is and I'll just wrap this up and go um
then to active inference what happened there if you think about it is you let
go of two things that were very precious for Jerry fer you let go of horizontal
boundaries and vertical boundaries and once you let go of that you really have to ask the question what is left of the
modularity of the Mind why should we keep it in place at all whatsoever right because what happened was you let go of
one there was the basic pillar of of the modularity of the mind which was the
boundary that was a distinguishing or dividing uh cognition on top and modules
at the bottom right this boundary doesn't you don't have this boundary anymore because now you have predictions coming down so you let go of this
boundary so Jerry doesn't get that and they have the vertical boundaries as well which
were very precious because those were about information encapsulation such that different modules are the main
specific and they do not talk to each other right so what you is you get rid of those vertical boundaries there's
there's an interesting there's an interesting historical point there um that just sorry to interrupt but this is
an interesting there there's an interesting chronology here which I actually learned during my undergrad where when I was looking at whether the
language comprehension was fundamentally modular so it was related that's hence why I brought up n jsky in 83 fodal has
very distinct definitions of information encapsulation and Dom specificity so do specificity is actually what we just
spoke about that there's a proprietary database that each module works on right so visual the visual module work on uh
photons or whatever you know or the language module works on syntactic
nodes and information informational encapsulation in 83 was top down beliefs
expectations doesn't affect the workings of those modules interestingly in in
2000s so he he writes another book or or article about modularity in the year
2000 he kind of conflicts and again I don't want to speak ill of Jerry fodo he's very important and he's also not
here anymore so he can't defend himself but he seems to confuse information encapsulation with dom specificity
because he talks about like this is a quote that a system is encaps a module is encapsulated if it's restrict if it
function is restricted to what its proprietary database contains so I think what's interesting there is factly what
you're were talking about in terms of horizontality and verticality kind of abandons the verticality there right he
wants to uh yeah he he abandons the verticality in the sense that by by sort
of a mission he concedes that maybe we should let go of this idea that top- down beliefs expectations don't
influence lower levels he does keep the um the horizont horizontality which is
let's keep these as distinct systems working on discrete um languages or data
for ones of a better ter so so it's just an interesting historical fact there that I think if he was H frodel might um
he could obviously offer some clarification but may also go back on his original 83 position of top down um
the the restriction for top down information to flow into modules yes absolutely and um I think that this is
also how you are absolutely right um in in in specifically the point about the
conflation between information and caps olation and the main specificity these are two different things and one of the things that are
that one of the aspects that I think would would need to be abandoned and that we abandoned in our Mark of
blankets in the brain is precisely that notion of information right so because you can
have domain specificity without relying on this notion of information encapsulation and things not conversing
with each other because again to my perspective that is anthropomorphizing the brain and brain activ ity right
we're talking about Dynamics and activities of the biology kind in the
brain and there is an anthropomorphization uh that I don't think it's necessary and again it proved
itself unnecessary right um so um but but we learn so much from from learning the
history of where these ideas come from and they have a place of course U and I think it's important for us to precisely
learn where they come from such that we start um improving and advancing our
understanding of uh the brain and cognition in different ways so there is
definitely place for for for Jerry Fodor um and I think that this is the place is
to get us into other other other uh advancements in the field and what um
what we have been able to to to to to see and uh through scientific evidence
in in in neuroscience precisely that that kind of way of thinking that may
have started as a metaphor doesn't really hold right and that there may be
um domain specificity I think you put it in a very nice way there may be domain
specificity without it being information encapsulation right and once you start
having to let go of all of these basic pillars of modularity it's gone we can
try to salvage it and then call it something and brand it something else but it's gone and that's when then you
also see in the history well we have now new um computational uh capacity or
strategy such as parallel distributed processing what shall we do let's try to apply the same thing that we did which
is what if we would think about the mind as if it were a parallel distributed processing system and then you have the
networks and predictive processing theor start rising up on the base of that analogy as well I am careful about going
over and abond and above the anal the it being a metaphor right because I always
think about the brain as a very biological kind of system as opposed to
a full agent with full capacities that thinks and reasons and models as if it were a scientist so I push back on that
I'm careful about that so the way from that position on then the way in which we theorize Mark of blank blanket is
being useful was you start from those understandings that the brain is a dynamical complex
system right that it changes over time that the ways in which
a full agent engages with the environment is going to have
significant impacts on the ways in which pathways are strengthened or are
weakened in the ways in which the brain is going to develop itself as an organ right
so you start from that very neurobiology kind of understanding of the brain that it is a complex system
meaning that it is a coupled system it is situated in a body it is situated within other organs uh in in in the
organism and this organism is situated in the environment right so we we we completely abandon the view of the brain
as being a predictive machine there even though you can and there's lit chore on
building upon the idea of the brain which of the brain being a predictive machine which comes from from Helm holds
and more recently you can theorize it and I've been um I've been presenting on that as you you can theorize it as the
low road or the high road to active inference which we can talk about later but the view is you can take that
pathway that's not the one that we took uh we took the pathway of the very neurobiology uh kind of way of the brain
being a highly situated organ within a larger system the larger system being
situated in an environment and all of these influences and interactions are
going to have an effect on the state that you're going to find the brain in a specific uh uh um point in time and
space so so then um starting from that understanding as opposed to the brain
being a a machine uh right so then we ask the question of whether or not uh
because this is what this is crucial this is the crucial point which is why I started by by describing mark of blink
is is this scientific construct that you can apply skill free comes skill free uh
that you can apply to anything that is a thing there is an open system you can apply it you can also apply it to the
brains but then you once you do that you have to test it out right you have to look into okay does this really make
sense can we find patterns of activity that would be explainable
through the application of Mark of blankets at different levels of
organization within the brain itself so then in that particular paper what we did was we we are we start from a
standpoint where we reject the modularity of the mind because we do not think that there are reasons scientific
reasons to think that the the the the the brain is
organized in very strict rigid ways call it modules whatever we want to call it
but in very strict rigid ways we do not think that that's the case because there is scientific reason not to take that
path and the Brain being a very Dynamic and changing um system then the question
that you have is how do we make sense of it right how do we find patterns in such
a dynamical system in such a coupled system how do we find those patterns can
we find those patterns so then let's apply this um uh Mark of blanket formulas
at different levels given the data that we have coming from DCM coming from
dynamical causal modeling of the brain so basically um in very very simple terms The View here is that we put the
brains in Scanners we get data out of the scanner and then we look at that and
just vast data the comic sense of it Con and start to think about how to make sense of that you employ DCM as a model
to make sense of that data and what you would get get from that is a nice causal topology about how um uh uh how
connections are made and Dynamics are formed so you get a nice pattern of that
if the model is is is is suitable and useful then you that's what you get so then from that kind of like um
scientific um point we we we grab all of that all of those nice models uh from
DCM and we see we look at whether or not we could apply the mark of blanket
formalism so the four the two sets of States um internal and external active
and sensory States in order to uh get an explanation of those pattern Dynamics at
different scales so we start off with the the scale of a single neuron and
then we have a cical column and then we have regions right and what is the what
is the the the take on message from this because of course if if anybody's interested uh in the details then the
paper is out there um but what is the take on message there is that we do find
the same patterns of behavior across scales by virtue of employing this uh
formalism and that is that is really good that's already quite um quite quite quite important because that means that
you can get what we started off our conversation with you can get um
understandings of activity that is occurring in the brain at different
scales where uh each of those scales is both operationally closed and
thermodynamically open so then what you get is you let completely go of that
rigid systems that you had with the modularity of the mind you completely let go of that and what you get is an
understanding of how um certain neurons in in in specific um environments you
can think about it in a very simple way as like a cell in a Cell tissue how a cell in a Cell tissue is interacting and
engaging with the tissue in order to do what it needs to do um so you can think
about you can use this formalism to precisely understand how that particular
system is behaving according to the environment that it is at so then you find these patterns of behaviors of like
certain neurons firing given certain um conditions and then you get all this
nice understanding of discou Behavior being situated that is highly Dynamic
and it really is dependent on the environment that it is situated at what
you also realize is that there are certain parts of the brain there are
certain specific parts of the brain um that you can see that they may be
insulated that they they they do not um conform to um active inference they do
not exchange um and that's in a way if you wanted to say that would be what Jerry F
had in mind as a modularity of the mind you could say that but all that happens there is a very simple bi biology
process which is the system already knows what to do without needing to know
what is going on in the environment it is what we say as it is set by Evolution
it works so it's been working so well that way that it doesn't need to know or get to know feedback from its
environment right so those would be the ones in which you would say oh it's encapsulated but it's informationally
encapsulated I wouldn't say so right right right right yeah there's a lot of that there's a lot of that um
cool I mean it I you also gave a really nice um description of for cognitive
science there so exactly as I said in my introduction um the four e for those who
can't remember embodied extended see if I remember enacted extended you get all
of them yeah um and I'm enjoying the history lesson as well so um because I
do as as you said I think the chronology is really important here just to get a picture of the philosophical foundations on which this work is being done but
eight years after Jerry Fodor releases the modularity of the Mind the very important book comes out which is the
embodied mind of Raa Thompson and rash before we go there because you work I
guess within that framework of as you said for cognitive science the embodied mind I think listeners will be curious
about you you mentioned scientific evidence refuting uh
modularity I just wondering if you could provide this maybe just with one example of a module which is not exhibiting the
typical um the typical features that Fodor laid out which would make it fundamentally modular so what what makes
it open let's say to its environment yeah one very clear example comes from the all the research in neural reuse so
that would itself already um sort of like move us away or it's it's I would
say it's it's strong reasons to move away from that rigidity of modules that
are do not change that are um as Jerry fod would conceive of it they are
hardwired in that way so another feature that you lose is the automaticity right
so the idea with the auto automaticity is that modules in a way are silly right
they don't know really what's going on they are hardwired to automatically process the information that they domain
specific to right so that's the automat automaticity they don't really have a
say in the meta so to speak um even though I'm completely anop anthropomorph
ing this story as as one would with the modularity of the mind uh so you you do
lose that um with with with the the the large evidence on on on um on neural
reuse where you see um which is extremely compelling and it it's
absolutely fascinating that you see certain neurons that we used to be
neurons for vision to become neurons for something else like like odit Tre system
for example depending on the necessity of the whole overall
system so what you see is the neural reuse um uh cases where well it really
it really challenges the basic aspects or properties that would make a module a
module right don't make domain specific or is it domain specific if it becomes the main specific to something else uh
the automaticity um as well so the the the the neural reuse um I think would be
a it's it's a great challenge um another one is of course neuroplasticity so the
studies in neuroplasticity do um challenge again the rigidity of uh the
the the the the non changeability of this hardwired um system yeah absolutely
okay great that's really useful yeah yeah I always think about um I think I got to about the murk effect when I was
learning about modularity of mind which is this auditory visual illusion that when people yeah people can search
up or do the murk effect but again that that brings into question um this encapsulated idea that muls can't speak
to each other okay excellent well as I said what became very popular uh after
these kinds of rigid computational accounts of the Mind was an activist
embodied models following verel Thompson and rush and verel was of course a
biologist and so um and he introduced the term aesis which kind of means this self
organization that we now speak of or self- evidencing um before 1991 so so as
you were saying we are inclined now to look at the brain as a biotic thing as a
biological system and this is very much uh for grounded in um embodied cognition
maybe it would be useful for everyone if we could just go through the four e
firstly um it doesn't it doesn't have to be super it's a very rich history um so I'm you know as long as short as is
suitable but maybe we could go yeah one by one and think about where is the
evidence or where is he philosophy or as the intuition that this is true um and
we can start I guess with the the first one which is embodiment what what does embodiment mean and kind of what is the
research around the embodied brain what what does it focus on what does does it Center on all right very very good um so
um embodiment is um something that is is a concept that comes from phenomenology
um from the existentialist Philosophy from phenomenology it's a very rich uh
concept and it is fundamental to understand a lot of confusion in the
field because we need just we need to distinguish between weak and strong embodiment I will call strong embodiment
the one that comes from chology and existentialist philosophy such as the one that for example Sim B had in mind
the body that one has that grounds our experience of the world that's the kind of embodiment from SIM
or um and um then within the E Frameworks uh within the E framework you
have different theories and while they do agree with let's say a couple of um
principles they are going to disagree age with within certain more nuanced
aspects of their own theories and I think the embodiment is one that is mostly useful for us to understand the
State of Affairs in the field and the theory and the confusions right so um
let's say that it is very reasonable to to think that most people in the field
of cognitive science today are not going to reject that the body plays a role to
understand the brain that the body plays a role to understand cognition very few people would disagree with this right
the followup question is how do you understand the body and I will get to that I will just say that only those
that would conceive of cognition as encapsulated in the brain as a computer
system such as the prediction error minimization accounts or for example
yakob who is kind of conservative account um that there he says very
clearly you can throw away the body the world and other people because the brain sufficiently as a machine takes care of
the cognitive business so that would be the only account that I know of that would not bring in the body to play a
fundamental role all other accounts do agree I think we have come to that
agreement that the body plays a fundamental role embodiment plays a fundamental role now the question the
follow-up question is how do conceive of embodiment and then you have two ways the weak and the strong weak embodiment
is the one that is endorsed for example by um predictive processing theories such as Andy Clark as the Visionary uh
behind it what happens there is that Andy Clark in his account invites the
body to play a causal role in cognition and this is important because also with the with the with the with the with the
body you can um interact with a world that is Technologic iCal where there are
things that then give you the extended mind but I'll I'll get to that if if we
have the time anyway so it's weak embodiment what does this mean this means that um cognition is a predictive
processing that takes place in the brain so this agrees with more conservative
predictive uh aor minimization accounts but not only in the brain predictions
but the prediction processing machine includes the body what does this mean
this means that the body is seen as part of the predictive machine the body is
seen as computational cognition is computational so that's why this is weak
embodiment so anic clar does not endorse the embodiment that MTI or Sim had in
mind he endorses a very computationalist kind of embodiment so this is why you
can kind of like to understand the E cognitive science you kind of have to spread it out within a range and then
you get like um you get like the more conservative ones and the more radical ones right the more conservative ones
are the ones that are going to say that cognition is computational the more
radical ones are going to say that cognition is not computation and then you have a spread out of of um of the
question that you can ask to help navigate the ecognition uh literature is
how radical do you want to be because if you want to say that cognition is computational you're not
radical at all right and radical doesn't have anything to do with original
radical just means how radical you are in comparison to Old theories such as
the the the computational theory of mind what is the computational theory of mind is everything we' been talking about with the modularity of the mind and
predictive processing theories this is all computational theory of Mind how radical are you in relation to the computational theory of Mind where are
the basic assumptions are to that cognition comes down to um uh
computational processes of information processing that's computational theory of mind and that the mark of the mental
is mental representation there would be more Nuance thing things to say but this would be two that you can ask yourself
and then you can ask how radical am I away from these two assumptions right so
that's the view and then you get like this weak embodiment which is very close to or if not it is um kind of like right
in the border between computational theory of mind and ecognition almost like shouldn't be there if you would
conceive that uh cognition within e the E umbrella is not computational right uh
so that's the very weak embodiment and then you have the strong embodiment which is any theory that explains
cognition by grounding cognition very much uh within the embodiment that the
experience that one has of the world of course here what we talking about is uh
the level of analysis and and understanding that uh people working in that field are looking at is um about
the full um agent that is situated in an
environment we are not talking about neurons of course we take that into consideration in the sense of the causal
relations that I mentioned before which is how is it that the experience of the world is going to aect effect and
influence the Bly biological processes and in there you also find the brain so
that's kind of like the strong embodiment from mopon H and all of that kind of thing uh that we have and mostly
applies to uh psych Psychotherapy and and and and psychological analysis and
then you get into um uh let's say in activism right and then in an activism
you find um different kinds again but let's say that both strong embodiment
and in activism they reject these two things they reject that cognition is a
computational process of information processing uh and they reject that the mark of the mental is mental
representation so they reject these two things right they reject in kind of like different ways but non not
non-compatible but they they they want to reject these two assumptions um so
the an activist um has different different ways um in which uh you can
also formulate of it um so you have the verela Thompson and rush so verela and
Matana uh starting the autopoetic um uh in
activism uh which is a very rich uh literature very based in in biology and
extremely compelling uh and very well formed um and then of course um others
more recently pick up on um autopoetic and activism and uh they have developed
more recently um the framework towards uh sense making uh in activism now I
want to just stop here to go to autois just to make the bridge with active inference where you can right where or
at least where I find that it's reasonable to make that breach um autoptic and activism um brings out and
a lot of recent work by an activists they also stress uh that out um they
bring out the understanding of crucial aspects of living systems from bacteria
to us um as having those two aspects as being thermodynamically open and as
being operationally closed and those two aspects Lounge the system into a state of precariousness so these are main
Concepts within theop poetic and activism and what this can then mean
that we can think of is that what does it mean for a system to be precarious well what it means is that the system
must must must interact with the environment in order to remain alive
what does this mean well this means that the system is coupled with the environment now again what does this
mean this means that the system the living being cannot be encapsulated from the environment what this would refute
is the conservative computationalist views that cognition comes down to being encapsulated in the brain and we can
throw away the body the world and other people so that's kind of like what this means so that's why the question is how
radical are you from The View that cognition comes down to computations in the brain right how radical are you so
we're making our way towards a more radical one and then once you find these ideas of like operationally closed
thermodynamically open therefore a state of precariousness therefore must be coupled otherwise it dies then you say
well this active inference framework actually captures that very nicely because I get conditional independency
from internal and external stat that would allow me to get the operationally closure but I also get the direct
influence of being thermodynamically open that comes from active and sensory States so then it really nicely captures
that state of precariousness as a tool so that's that's nice I think and then
you can um you can go as radical as you want which is to completely push back on
um any views or kinds of theories or ways of thinking that would bring out uh
cognition and cognitive systems from bacteria to more sophisticated inculturated systems like us um as um
being computational of any kind and this is something that I've been presenting as augmented cognition in the in the
sense of um the kinds of like computational models that we develop um and
mathematical thinkings that we develop they are our cultural PR practices right
so in that sense we developed these very sophisticated ways of making sense of
the natural world of which brains are part of living systems are part of right
we develop all of those very highly sophisticated systems and computational
um capacity um to make sense of the world around us and what I'm very very
careful is not to make that last step which would bring me back to the computational theory of mind to say that
those computational strategies are ontological predictors of what the brain
is of or or of what the living system is so I am very careful about that that
maybe put me in the very radical position because I reject all of the computational theory of mind uh view um
so that's how you kind of like make your way within the ecognition is by asking how radical are you in respect to to
computational the of mine excellent great um I think we have
two more e but we but we basically touched upon them um one is
embedded um and the next one is extended um do I give a brief absolutely word to
that absolutely so um the embedded one is the one that as I was spre spreading it out in range and I was saying that
well um you have here very close uh you have a bound with the computational
theory of mind and here you have the radical stuff so embedded is here close to the the the computational theory of
mind and this is the E that I mentioned before when I explained that um very few
people in com in cognitive science in the field would reject that the brain is
embedded in the body and the body is embedded in the environment very few people would reject that so that's the
embedded that's why this can be seen as almost close to the weak em embodiment
that's the embeddedness very few people would talk about encapsulation only with that exception
of the one that is the prediction rization by Yakov can throw away the world um and other PE the body and other
people so that's the embededness is just the claim that the body is the brain is
situated in the body the body is situated in the environment now then how you are going to explain that situatedness is where you are going to
fall in different ease in the strong embod in the different kinds of uh in activism
the radical in activism or the more sense making in activism um how you are going to explain that it's the
embeddedness is what's going to make the difference on our radical you go and then you have the extended which I
briefly mentioned um so the extended comes as a part of like a package uh
with um uh radical predictive processing by and Clark so the package is that um
it it is it is radical in uh relation and in comparison with prediction and
minimization um or conservative one it's radical in relation to that but it's not radical in relation to other eats so
what happens is that what you have is an understanding of cognition as being a computational process that takes place
where well not only in the brain but also in the body right the body plays a causal role for that information
processing predictive processing to occure and to happen uh in the ways that it does now it can also incorporate
objects tools from the environment that are going to play a causal role of the
same kind as um your body plays so then you have a whole system that is
distributed it's is a computational system we still talking about computational theory of mind it is a computational system that involves brain
body and tools and that's the extended mind great um and yeah I always feel the
need to kind of refer people to where these ideas come from so um extend of my hypothesis Clark and Chara's classic
paper um and definitely worth checking out I think when I hear uh these
stronger an activist or stronger for recognition um perspectives which refute
representation as the mark of the mental or Mark of cognition it makes me think
uh where does Consciousness fit into all of this because as a conscious
um you know subject uh being with a subjective start upon the world I you
know I I have some sympathy for the enti list view because I think it feeds into some intuitions that I can't like this
mind is privileged and can be divorced in some sense from the world upon which it does some computational work so if
really we we we take the privilege away from representation um
which which I think is also a kind of worm so we don't have to get into exactly what is a
representation but maybe we maybe we can go there um what's what's the kind of R
of qualia subjectivity intentionality and the kind of uh features of
Consciousness oh thank you for that question I always feel like when um when
we go that path um the mental representation being the mark of the mental um it feels like uh we are
getting to watch a TV show halfway through like in season two right because we don't ask the questions where the
representations and content comes from right so that's the hard problem of content so I know that we want to get
that because that would allow us because we already are in the place where we do
have me we can engage and develop and more and more every more sophisticated mental representations that what we are
that's what part of what we are doing here is engaging in ways in which we are involving and employing uh mental
representation such that we can understand each other right so it's like we're already half season halfway
through this through the TV show we are already like in season three um so but there was a beginning of the TV show
right well you didn't have any of this you as a baby as an infant could not be communicated with me in this way about
these things where does that come from that comes from something called inculturation right so I think before
before we start explaining things as if they were always like that we need to understand that there is a trajectory in
cognition in cognitive development that we shall not forget so all of those things had to be acquired unless you
want to defend nativism that that would be also could could be very close to Jerry F as well
because you already have these starter packs that you already have this very very much in place um Machinery that
would allow us you to have all of these sensory all of this semantic content already ready to use that you could
start making sense now if you reject folder you reject it all now you have to
answer the question how can we do this where does this come from you've rejected folder right so you have a
story to tell now the way that I I see it and many um in activists do see it uh
and by the way also very much compatible than with mathematical uh Frameworks of
dynamical and complex Theory um and that is that is employed in in in a lot of
psychology uh uh Empirical research as opposed to the computational theory of mind uh even though that's the
mainstreaming in cognitive psychology it's not the only one um and the way in
which you can think about it is that you um cognition the m so what I'll start by
saying this I've I've heard many times people ask me but how is it possible
that there's cognition but there is no no mental representations no one is saying that so that's not a claim that's
not a claim from an activist an activist an activists don't say that there aren mental representations what they tell
what they want to tell you is that mental representations do not come for free you are not born with them you had
to do things in the environment in order to acquire them you have to to develop
it as a skill so we give you a story about a hard problem of content where does that come from when it does not
come as within the nice starter pack that cherry foder or decart would tell
you that it comes from so once you get rid of that you have a story to tell and the story is that it depends on
inculturation so basically as you start as an infant as a baby we we come into
the world and we start interacting with the world this world is and this is the key point this world is already social
it's already a social cultural setting there is no baby that is born and is developing within a setting that is not
social already so it is in the ways in which the baby interacts with the their
caregivers that the parents are the caregivers and the world around them
that is going to gradually allow them to build um simpler um Concepts simple ways
of using Concepts and then scuff holding that into a a numerical system in a
conceptual framework and then later on in being able to engage in logical
thinking and reasoning and then being able to express some sophisticated ideas
and maybe even becoming a scientist and contribute to developing highly sophisticated computational models that
study black holes so it's an inculturated process of course as we are
here doing this interaction um what we are using is we are making the best use
of our most skilled to so far uh and I'm sure that um that will go keep going in
a in a in a a trajectory but our best skills of um explaining ideas and
discussing so we are using and making the best use of our best mental representations but I also have to say
that this interaction does not reduce to those U mental representations there is
an embodiment aspect of the situation that we are at a a very clear uh example
of that is that the interaction is different whether or not we are having the interaction in person or we are having the interaction online we'll make
things different because we don't share the same physical space so this is just an example of um how embodiment here
would play uh uh uh some some would play out but the idea is that eventually
you'll start developing the capacity to develop and engage in mental representations also as you talk to
other people and you make sense of the world around you okay cool um I'm going to play not
going to play Devil's Advocate but um and I also don't want to make you commit to any position nor am I asking you to
solve the hard problem of Consciousness because that's not that's not going to happen this also not the purpose of the
podcast but I understand in that sense that mental representations are kind of
Downstream on enacted behavior on social cultural norms right it they as you say
there's a lot of evidence to suggest that it's not some hardwired Chomsky and module right there we can take that as
kind of axiomatic I guess my question here is that kind of makes sense in terms of mental representations per se let's say
they develop out of this inactivist um way of being that we have what it
doesn't necessarily answer is the kind of characteristic features and the idiosyncratic features of
Consciousness so the actual like fundamental what it is like to be me
what it is like to be you to use Thomas Nagel's terms so I guess my question here is
um again not trying to pin you down I understand there's a lot of nuance here would the an activist be uh sort of
would they be attracted to the notion that Consciousness is epip phenomenal and by that I mean for people who don't
know epip phenomenal Consciousness is the idea that Consciousness is like the steam coming off a steam train so it's
caused by uh neural physiological Behavior but doesn't actually have any causal effect on those um on those
mechanisms so it happens it's there right and it kind of depends on what philosophy of Mind Theory you um
subscribe to but would they say that Consciousness has no causal role um I'm
imagining that there aren't many substance dualist in activists but what
what what kind of considerations have they made of the role of Consciousness right um so I I I'll just bring some
some something in so that so when we talk about qualia uh
epiphenomenalism um um and uh what it is like um like in the bat um what is like
to be a bad Thomas nle when we are or or the the hard problem of Consciousness when we talk about that we are within a
certain conceptual toolkit right we are already within what
wienstein would call a bottle a theory right and it's important to to to
understand that when we start making our way within a
theoretical path it's like we're building blocks of a house and then we getting a certain kind of house by
virtue of the the belief system thoughts that and the path that we are
doing that's the kind of like conceptual Machinery that you get once you play
that game so and by playing that game I'm here referring to or having in mind
viin Stein's language games so you can tell the story of or you can do the epistemology of
understanding uh how cognition comes around and about and works by playing
different games and that is the traditional analytic philosophy of Mind
Game and that game is very associated with the computational theory of mind so
what I'm trying to say here is that once you put on certain goggles there are certain things that you're going to see
and there are certain things that you cannot see so once you start on that path of
thinking Journey those are the problems that you're going to find those are the problems that like the hard problem of Consciousness is a problem that you're
going to find because then what you get is uh how do we study both the easy
problem and the hard problem so you necessarily when you start going in that direction you find those problems and
then you have the explanatory Gap that how we close the gap so these are problems that come up within the
computational theory thinking language game so those are the goggles right and of course we can try to make
these theories talk to each other but it's very important to understand that it's almost like axiomatic in the sense
that you start solving an equation in one way it the equation will look a
certain way you start solving the equation in a different way the equation will look in a in a different way right
so that's almost what we are talking about right because we are not starting
from the point in E cognition doesn't start from the point of view of the
brain in the other um more traditional computational theor of M of course it does so once you do start from the bra
brain being machine note what questions come up okay so if the brain is a machine then how is it that it gives
rise so it's a scaling up problem how is it that it gives a rise to Consciousness
how does this machine give rise to Consciousness because there are there is evidence that there's Consciousness that
is what it is like to be about there's qualia there's a hard problem of Consciousness this is within that kind
of thinking because you start by the brain being a machine and then you ask how do we get to the good stuff and then
you get all of that from within the more radical e cognitive science you don't
start from the brain being a machine that's the first thing you reject right and that's also in dynamical and complex
systems theory the case you have phenomenal work by Van Helder and other people that precisely reject that
cognition has anything to do of being anywhere or we should use any conceptual
uh any concept from a computational scientist perspective to Kit right so
then you don't start from there you start from the point of view that living systems are precarious and they engage
with the world to maintain themselves the brain is part of the story but you
don't start there right so in this engagement what happens is you have you
engage with the world because you have certain goals usually the goals have to do in a more minimalistic biology way is
that you don't want to die it's the precariousness of of pushing back on the second law of Thermodynamics right so
you engage in the world for that reason because you want to remain alive typically this is the most basic biology
there's much more than that but let's just stay with that so then what happens is you start exploring the world and in
exploring the world you do that by exploring your body so that's when the body comes in as the body is the means
by which you have access and explore the world and respond to the world's and
invitations to exploration so it is in these interactions with the world that are extremely embodied and limited
they're both constrained and possible by the body that whatever you do it's
cognitive behavior and this cognitive behavior is what are the goods that we
want to understand in cognitive science and we do that by by explaining them
through patterns of behavior right so it's completely different
goggles yeah I I am going to push back because I think it's I think it's good it's not adversarial it's collaborative
um I I just sense or I just kind of believe that the Vicken styan relativism
has its has its limits right it has its points where you say well there are certain things that maybe aren't
relative in the language game and maybe one of those are the fundamental aspects
of my experience that I can attest to regardless of if I'm in a braid of
lat or if I'm an evil demon is tricking me right like unless I adopt some illusionism about Consciousness which
I'm not willing to do but again like it's not there there's not a viable position to do but I'm going to take it for granted that like even even radical
illusionists wouldn't say that qualia doesn't exist it's just not what we think it is and I'm think here Kei Frankish and den it so for me like the
Vick steinan relativism that qualia is itself part of a um Paradigm to use a
sort of term of Thomas [ __ ] or it's part of a boss or it's part theoric yes in the sense of the linguistic aspect of it
but the fundamental phenomenon is at least for what I can tell is real so
what is the alternative I guess is my question right yet I I I don't I'm not refuting the notion that a cognition is
in some way constrained and opened up impossibility by having a body by being embedded in the social context and so on
but we still have to GR in my opinion we still have to grasp with the fundamental
facts of phenomenal experience so I'm sorry if I sound like David Charmers and
David Charmers parrot but no it seems to me that like I can't get away from the
explanatory Gap and I don't think that that's a problem in my theoretical framing of the problem I think
that's because the phenomena phenomena associated with Consciousness is so radically different from anything else
in the physical Universe yeah and and there are very um I must say that there
are very good points that are made by David chalas in that respect that I that I uh very much um agree with
um now to go back to that and to link that in a way that would be um that
would be compatible within uh my view of an activism I would say that and also
wienstein um there is a real world that you don't
have access to so I completely agree with what you said right I completely agree uh that
there is a limit to relativism yes that's the limit the limit is the limits of my view I'm not going to say the
limits of my language as which I did in the first in the first book in trus because you overcame that so I'm just
going to um I'm going to dare to reformulate that for him and say the limits of my perspective are my world so
there's there there there are aspects of the world that I will not have access
to and that's just the way things are I will not have access to your experience of the world because and here's the
inactivist bit coming in because my experience
is determined by the set of past interactions that
I've had with the world and this moment right here where um this experience is
taking place and everything else outside of this I don't have access
to that's the bit in the Bo in in the box right so the the the idea is not the rejection
of other perspectives and that's precisely vien Stein's point is understanding understanding that there are it's the humility of understanding
that there are other perspectives in the world and you do not have access to them you only have access to your own uh very
um specific kind of perspective to the world now another thing that he adds that it may be uh useful um is to say
that for him these are seen in terms of aspects of the
world you see the world through the aspects that are made relevant to you
right here right now given what given your past experiences your past interactions of the world that's why
certain things will become Salient in this particular moment in the environment which connecting to the
other Theory you would call the what it is like to be me to what it is like see
I don't know if I would um the well to me I wouldn't right I
mean the the salience of my environment I completely agree is shaped by my body
it's shaped by my homeostatic requirements it's shaped by my sociocultural upbringing status and so
on but the fact of the matter is is that things we could describe things as being
Salient without necessarily invoking well that's a good question I guess whether we could invoke salience
of out Consciousness but I guess I I mean as a force experiment you can in a sense um I had John Vu on last
week and he was talking about relevance realization and so it's very sort of still fresh in my mind I said my my
reading of this would be that salience is just a manifestation of the conscious experience itself but are we going to
get any closer to the actual fundamental characteristics right like whether it's salience or visual perception or
auditory perception I mean like the Charmers problem is still there
right uh the Chara's problem is okay let's let me just go back to the initial thing because otherwise I'll lose it um
that you said um um the the note that the difference between the Frameworks is
quite it's quite this simple thing which is Things become relevant and Salient
and experienced in a certain way within ecognition because of the embodied
experiences that you've had in the past within a computational theory of mind you might say the same you might say
things are relevant what it is like to be me why well because of the way that
information has been process processed in the brain as a as a as a machine so these are different explanations for the
same kind of phenomenon they're diff they are completely different so this is where they are aart
right um now as to the problem of um the heart I think when you said Chara
problem you meant the heart problem of Consciousness right um y okay so it may
be the case and this is also a Vian sign move so I'm not going to take credit for that um uh it may be the case and this
is very in line with with David chers which is why I think there are certain features of it of of of chmer thinking
that I that I really like and agree with um vians makes this point not everything
that is there to be understood about the mind can be understood through the
scientific meod and this is the hard problem of consciousness that chmer talks about
right and and I think that he makes a good point there I think that he is very
um cever and very very correct and I completely agree with three points that
he makes which is that many people are falling up on the Trap of claiming to
study Consciousness and experience and a first person however you want to call it
depending on the theory you're coming from um embodiment if you like they claim to study embodiment and conscious
experience and all of those kind of like good things that really make us by going to the brain Alone by
studying easy stuff and that is a theoretical trap it's a fallacy and
that's where I really agree with with David charma's work which is why I'm doing what I'm doing in in ecognition
precisely because I do not want to get into that trap which I think it's it's a trap as well I agree with him great
wonderful well that's our that's our convergence point and again I it's it's it's not so much that we need to solve
the hard problem but I'm just curious about whether it retains its problematic nature in in for so that that that's
good to get some clarity on that I Rend I wonder just it it's it's a difficult
question but and again I'm not trying to get you to solve the whole problem I'm just curious about your thoughts on this
I said I had John Vu on last week and he's got this idea that getting more
precise on the f function of Consciousness would help us in resolving the nature of Consciousness
the hard problem do you see any viability in that
link you can get some something by the function if you within the Frameworks
that I work on active inference and activism right Within These Frameworks I'm going to give the answer within these Frameworks you can get some
explanatory traction you can get some um epistemic virtue out of thinking function but it doesn't get you all the
way through it gets you to understand the precariousness and why systems
behave in the way that they do it's because they the function is that they want to push back on the second law of
Thermodynamics they want to remain alive but then you think about a point that Simon DEA made which is also a very
clever point which is if all that is to life is to not to
perish then what is it that makes us different to vegetation right so function gives you
as much as it's interesting and relevant to the point that it explains or it
gives you as far as a cross life explanation so one thing that you get is
the function is all life does not want to die typically That's the Law that's
the that's the free energy principle that's all but it gets you as far as that and
you want more because you want to get to the goods of like uh embodied experience right why
people behaving the way that they do right so here I think
that you can bring in also again some on the above wise is is is I think is a
good segue into um making this point which is very under the E umbrella but I think she makes this point in in a way
that here is it's going to make the point um clearer which is that if if
again going back to the point if all that is to life is not to perish then what makes us different from vegetation
what makes us different from vation is that we are in um a kind of cognitive
development trajectory that we become enculturated we are situated in Social
cultural environments and once that happens we start behaving in ways that not only do
we get the conceptual toolkits the reasoning Etc but we also have access
and contribute and Co construct those social environments from the very
embodied situation that we are at so in a way the biological body constraints
the access and co-construction that you do with the world as well as the social culturally developed embodiment also
plays a role in the participation that you have or not have within the
environment that you navigate now she puts this in terms of uh the living being between it's it's
a condition between freedom and facticity which see how how compatible
this is with what we were saying about push pushing back on the on the second law of Thermodynamics you want to remain
alive but you don't want to remain alive within an encapsulated environment you want to remain alive and do really well
in a social cultural environment which is why we are more than simple vegetation that just wants to leave we
want to live well we want to live good we want to do things that are good for us so we start now entering the realm of
reasons like reasons that we need to give for the things that we do in the ways that we act right so now we start
to become very sophisticated start to get to this like uh mental representation if you will but it
doesn't come for free it's not a commodity we we now we start getting into like season 3 right which is like
things start to get like really interesting so then you can explain um embodied experience as being social
culturally situated that is dependent on the embodiment that you have and that
embodiment that you have is what is going to somehow determine where you are
navigating continuously between freedoms and facticity and she puts it even more
precisely between um agency and
objectification and then you start reasons to how you navigate the social cultural World wonderful yeah yeah it's
the first time I've had s b brought up in intive inference conversation but um
she that that's great uh yeah it's a wonderful segue actually into existentialism and phenomenology and and
we're big fans of mlo Ponte and haiger and draus on this on this podcast as well I thought what you said was
interesting which is that as you as you said correctly the free energy principle is a principle it's like hamiltonian
principle of least action right it's kind of a where it's it's a first principles ontological explanation of
just like what in the case of the FY principle what things have to do if they're going to continue through time
to persist but active inference um or in
certain cases predicted processing or in certain cases computational theories of mind or in certain cases it activat
theories mind are what we call Process theories so it's if we take the free agent principle just to be axiomatically
true in the sense that it's kind of and I think Carl would say this himself it
if you actually put it down to its nuts and bolt it doesn't say too much right it's things do what things have to do to
continue to be the things that they are really and there's a lot of fun maths but it's really about how it's
implemented in us or artificial intelligence or whatever it is um those process theories become
falsifiable so predicted processing might not be the right account of uh continuous St space um active inference
or um perhaps the mind is uh you know fundamentally Downstream on the body in
in a radically embodied way I guess because it's falsifiable um a question that came to
my mind when you were speaking um about activism is and the history as well of cognitive science is as you say there's
very few people who will adopt a radical computational um position these days
daycard John C for example but for cognitive science is very popular right
to put it simply can you envisage a future where for where future science and future
philosophy tell us that viewing the mind as embodied enacted embedded what was
the last one go on Wikipedia um yeah is not the
the right way to view it as we now look back on the computational picture and think it's incomplete yeah okay so I I'm going to
go back to the goggles um it it seems that the ways in so so science is built
on um on First Steps right on the goggles that you put and then you end up
with certain kinds of um theories that now you have and now what would I do
with this I test it I see if it makes sense right in with the case that it doesn't make sense uh we we we don't
know but it is about putting these goggles um and a lot of what is done still in in
cognitive psychology is very daycard is very starting in in season 3 in like
okay minds are mental representation so nobody cares about things that or about
experiments or setting up experiments or thinking or reasoning about how did it come to
be right where we we should put more effort on that how it came to be which
is what by the way dynamical in complex systems theory applied to psychology does that's all they do all they do is
to uh focus on the developmental trajectories to understand how they
evolve and develop how States change into um developing and evolving um and
and much of what is done in cognitive psychology is starting in season 3 is
the the mind is representational and now we got to find that not only in our
cognitive psychology experiments as we put as we as we design our experiments
right is with that assumption in place and that's why this is so dangerous it
may be the case that one is right to think that the mark of the mental is mental
representation but not criticizing it and not having a critical point of view about it what what it means is that
everything that we do within cognitive science science within setting up experiments within setting up
computational models simulations it's going to be starting with the assumption that the mark of the mental is mental
representation and that the brain is an information processing machine so this
is going to be defining for everything that we do and all that I'm saying is that let's take a step back and go to
the beginning of the series as opposed to starting in in in season three and question these things and if they still
make sense great we've done a very good job right so so that's that's the point
of view right and I think that what ecognition the more radical view does is
it takes away that those toys and puts you into okay when you have to start
from the very beginning what do you have and how do you build so it it it puts
things into into pressure on whether that is the case because when you do the bit of the
history of philosophy of mind and you realize that a lot of it has been done
by borrowing conceptual toolkits from computational science then you ask the question what is left for philosophy of
mind is there a philosophy of mind or is there a borrowing conceptual toolkit from computer
science now that is a that's a provocative question I'm not going to I'm not going to try and answer it it it
it's cool the way you talk about the the scientific theories it reminds me we had ma alberon as our second guest and
actually on the day of us calling this the podcast just came out so everyone should definitely go and watch it but we had a long chat about epistemic
communities and the kind of silos that people end up in and that's actually very much akin to what you were saying
that people can really end up stuck in their scientific Paradigm and I'm really hoping that doesn't happen to
me I think it's kind of happening already I mean it makes me think the my
my sort of um philosophy science is not as good as it should be and it should get better but I'm aware of Thomas C in
this idea of the Paradigm the way it sounds to me is that like I don't know I'm adopting a kind of more heelan
perspective where um you got the computational theory of the mind and in activism like radical in activism as
your thesis um and your sort of antithesis and you have this dialectical
relationship right and then what you might end up with is a symphysis and that might I don't know
it's a very broad question but do you see science unfolding in that
or is it kind of more of a incremental Pursuit towards a higher or or getting
closer to truth so um yeah you do have those two different paradigms and I would answer that in in in in in a in a
very clear way I think that all that we have in the computational theory of mind
is our human social culturally situated
experience as a human species best efforts to understand
a phenomenon in the natural world so we develop all this computational Machinery
strategies models Etc because we this is what makes us human we want to
understand the world around us and part of the world around us is human beings
right so then we we have all of that as a reflection or as telling or as a
manifestation of what we can do as a species when we come down to being
epistemic communities and these epistemic communities are and ma was
absolutely right are completely social culturally situated so uh science itself like our
own individual experience of the world does not occure in an encapsulated
manner we could aim for an ideal bird ey
view perspective of being doing science in a way that is completely objective but as
wienstein already told us we don't have that we cannot get out of the trajectory
that brought us here we cannot have access to that other perspective only our own and that is going to be biased
and overlooking that it's dangerous because one would claim that that that
is possible and that's not that's why our best our best um capacity as a human
species is these epistemic communities where we can exchange ideas test ideas
with each other give feedback to each other and improve each other's thinkings and um an experiment such that we
improve in a collective effort that is scientific wonderful I like that it's
spiriting I don't like the idea that we're just stepping on the the toes of our ancestors maybe they did have
something good to tell us and we can build together but maybe never get there because we're blinded in some sense I
mean um obviously where one cannot speak therefore one must be silent um in this
case we could go on forever um I do want to make it clear that your work is
incredibly Broad and diverse and touches on a wonderful range of things so we could have spoken about religion you
have a wonderful paper on religion from an act of inference perspective um autism among other things uh we didn't
even touch upon artificial intelligence agents um so there's going to have to be
around two I suppose it there's where can people find
your work what are you working on what have you got coming out where can people find you because I'm sure they'll want to know more about what you're doing
yeah just on my website that's usually what is updated um which is www. energy
poo.com so usually there you got the links to other places like Publications
Etc and on Twitter as well I'm usually active so anything that comes out uh any
uh conference that I'm organizing participating or papers that are out I always share them on on on my Twitter so
that's usually the places super great okay that's wonderful well it's half
past 11 UK p.m. so I need to need to dash off to bed but this has been an
absolute pleasure um it thank you so much for your time and yeah as I said we should definitely do this again oh thank
you so much what a terrific uh exciting uh uh conversation thank you so much and definitely up for round two well

13. BAA Summary – The SoURCE CODE program is seeking to provide novel technologies to assist
forensic experts in making determinations of the most likely attackers, based on coding styles. The
program will explore full feature spaces in binary code and source code files to measure the similarity
between files and provide information to forensic experts to the likely origins (country, groups,
individuals, etc.). This capability would enable the automated matching of similar binaries from
known samples, allowing analysts to speed up the attribution of malicious attacks to improve law
enforcement and intelligence community responses.
OVERVIEW
SECTION 1: FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through
the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process. The use of a BAA solicitation allows a wide range of
innovative ideas and concepts. The BAA shall appear first under Contract Opportunities on
https://SAM.gov, then the IARPA website at http://www.iarpa.gov/. The following information is for
those wishing to respond to this Program BAA.

This BAA (IARPA-BAA-24-02) is for the Securing our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments
(SoURCE CODE) Program. IARPA is seeking innovative solutions for the SoURCE CODE Program in
this BAA, which is envisioned to be a 30-month effort across all focus areas, beginning approximately
July 2024. Technical Area 1 is unclassified. Technical Areas 2 and 3 are classified efforts. A Classified
Addendum to this BAA, including the Description for Technical Areas 2 and 3 will be distributed
separately to qualified offerors. See SECTION 4.
1.A. Program Overview
The volume, methods, and complexity of cyberattacks on companies and infrastructure has grown
significantly and will continue to evolve over time. These cyberattacks – whether on government systems
or private companies – pose a serious threat to national security. At the same time, there is a shortage of
cyber expertise to fill all necessary cyber-focused positions in the commercial world. This challenge holds
true with cyber-forensic experts, who play an important role in attributing these attacks to assist with
informing companies and governments on the threats that are facing the U.S.
Attribution of these malicious attacks can work to disrupt criminal cyber capabilities and improve law
enforcement and intelligence community responses to attacks. The Diamond Model of Forensic attribution
[1] is a common methodology used by forensic experts to attribute attacks on systems. The diamond model
captures the process that forensic experts go through by looking at multiple aspects of the information
available to include each point on the diamond (as shown in Figure 1) – this includes the Victim of the
attack, the capabilities used in the attack, and infrastructure used in the attack. With this information, the
diamond model helps to infer the likely attacker. The SoURCE CODE program is not seeking to automate
the entirety of attribution (the entirety of the diamond model of forensic attribution). Instead, SoURCE
CODE will seek to automate and assist forensic experts on the Attacker-Capability edge (as shown in the
green oval in Figure 1).
Page 3 of 64
Figure 1. The Diamond Model of Forensic Attribution: showing the edge that the SoURCE CODE program is seeking to assist forensic experts.
SoURCE CODE will create novel methods and technologies that go beyond the common lexical and
syntactic features that have been explored in prior literature; these features might include semantic and
behavioral features that may become salient features for similarity and demographic traits. The Program
will create scientifically validated forensic similarity and analytic technologies that allow for a measure of
similarity of code and binaries as well as provide additional information or components of the code that
may assist in analyzing hidden demographic information (groups, countries, or individuals where possible).
SoURCE CODE systems shall provide evidence or explanations, beyond just a similarity score, to assist
forensic experts in making a final attribution. Figure 2 shows the expected tasks in this effort – including
the expected outputs explored by performers.
Figure 2. The SoURCE CODE vision: Forensic systems capable of measuring similarity and providing additional information about the likely demographics
of the author(s).
SoURCE CODE seeks to go beyond the limitations of existing academic literature in the space that utilizes
limited subsets of hand-crafted features in largely the lexical and syntactic domains. SoURCE CODE seeks
to explore the semantic and behavioral features found within code to extract information and determine
similarity. SoURCE CODE will also explore methods to provide evidence or explanations to the forensic
experts to assist in their final determination.
Offerors to the SoURCE CODE program shall propose against the main goals of the similarity and
demographic focus areas to ensure that their models will be able to meet the goals of the program. Offerors
shall propose methods to explore a fuller feature space (to include the possibility of learned features) to 
Page 4 of 64
identify salient features that may be invariant across datasets. Using those feature sets, offerors will also
propose similarity or demographic analytic algorithms for measuring source code to source code, binary to
binary, and in later phases source code to binary and vice versa. Additionally, offerors shall propose
methods in which significant evidence or explanations can be provided back to forensic experts to make a
final determination.
A robust, unclassified data collection initiative will be part of the SoURCE CODE Program to assemble
diverse text types for use in Research and Development (R&D) for algorithm training, and in T&E for
comparing the algorithm performance against ground truth. The T&E Team will conduct dataset
development activities throughout the life of the program using Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
Human Subject Research (HSR) protocols. A portion of the data will be held out for T&E, the remaining
portion will be made available to Performers for R&D. The Test and Evaluation cycle is described in more
detail in 1.E Testing & Evaluation. Additional details on program data can be found in 1.D Program Data.
The SoURCE CODE Program will pursue rigorous and comprehensive independent T&E to ensure that
research outcomes are well characterized, deliverables are aligned with program objectives, and
performance is measured across the full range of data conditions. T&E activities will not only inform
Government stakeholders on SoURCE CODE research progress but will also serve as valuable feedback to
the Performers to improve their research approaches, algorithm training practices, and system development.
The SoURCE CODE Program will work closely with experts in the field of Engineering and Forensic
attribution of software to continually refine and improve T&E methodologies.
1.A.1 Technical Challenges and Objectives
Offerors shall address three focus areas within the Technical Area 1 (TA1) to meet the goals of SoURCE
CODE to develop novel, human interpretable similarity and demographic algorithms. Offerors must
propose novel approaches to each of these focus areas, and if selected as a Performer, Performers will be
required to create an end-to-end technology with components from each focus area. These focus areas
include:
Feature Space Generation and Extraction: The goal of this focus area is to research and develop an
encoding scheme that projects source code and binary representations of software into an optimized feature
space wherein observations from the same classes are projected near one another, regardless of the
representation of the software (binary or source code). Approaches may use entirely learned features (i.e.,
Neural Network approaches), hand-crafted, or a combination of features. Successful approaches must
utilize features that are predictive of class similarity and/or demographic information (country, group,
individual). Deliverables will be evaluated by the T&E team using metrics outlined in 1.F Program
Metrics.
Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms: The goal of this focus area is to research and develop
a system that will successfully identify similar binaries within a corpus using the stylistic characteristic of
the software being analyzed. Systems must leverage representations from the feature space encoder to
determine whether two or more software representations are similar or come from a specific author, group,
or country. The software similarity and demographic analytic algorithms will be evaluated by the T&E
team using metrics outlined in 1.F Program Metrics.
System Explainability: Systems developed in TA1 must provide human-interpretable feedback providing
evidence or explaining why specific documents likely are, or are not, similar or from a specific demographic
group. Offerors shall propose novel evidentiary or explainability techniques to address this goal, and
methods to evaluate this approach that are potentially generalizable to other performer approaches,
including justifiable metrics. T&E Teams will finalize the protocol for evaluating explanations in Phase 1
and implement this protocol in evaluations during subsequent phases.
Page 5 of 64
Figure 3 provides an example of the TA1 software components that will be expected under this program.
T&E teams will design component interfaces to ensure that systems are modularized, allowing for addition
or removal of components to meet government transition needs and additional evaluations.
Figure 3. Performer Outputs for TA1. Inputs will be source code and/or binary representations of software. The performers will be expected to featurize
and create similarity and/or demographic analytic systems with explainability components.
1.A.2 Program Phases
The SoURCE CODE program is anticipated to be a 2.5-year (30 month) effort, comprised of two (2) phases.
Both phases are being solicited under this BAA. Phase 1 will be 18 months in duration and phase 2 will be
12 months. The phases will encompass all of the TA1 focus areas described in previous sections (1.A.1
Technical Challenges and Objectives and 1.A.2 Program Phases).
Offerors are required to propose to both phases and all focus areas within TA1 of the Program under
this BAA. Proposals that omit any of phases or focus areas will be considered non-compliant.
SoURCE CODE aims to create systems that can accomplish similarity and demographic analytics under
multiple conditions encountered by Law Enforcement and U.S. Intelligence Community stakeholders.
Program phases are designed to test Performer systems against increasingly challenging data scenarios.
Differences in phases are shown in Table 1.
Table 1. SoURCE CODE Program Phases and progression of challenges between both phases, data permitting. * Closed set means the target is within the
set; an Open set indicates that the target may not be within any class in the set (unseen example).

Type of Set * Closed Set Open set
Each program phase will have multiple milestone deliverables at which performers will submit software
deliverables to the T&E team for independent evaluation against datasets, to include hidden datasets.
Deliverables will occur in 4 month increments and include featurization methods for testing, along with
similarity and demographic analytic algorithms. Deliverables are outlined in Figure 4.
Page 6 of 64
Figure 4. Mapping of TA milestones and activities to Phases. Also shows a schedule of key milestones and deliverables.
Evaluations will be performed on existing and sequestered datasets using performer-submitted,
containerized software components. Aspects of evaluation that involve human adjudication (i.e.
explainability) or feedback will be performed by the T&E team, but performers may self-test using human
evaluators.
In Phase 1, IARPA will provide development datasets and an evaluation harness developed by the T&E
team and provided at program kick-off, and any updates will be provided as they are released during the
life of the program. The same harness will be used for testing and evaluation of Performer-submitted
software components at each subsequent evaluation milestone. The purpose of the evaluation harness is to
enable performer-site training and testing for both the feature space, similarity, and demographic analytic
algorithms. IARPA will also furnish documentation of the program Application Programming Interface
(API) developed by the SoURCE CODE T&E Team. This Government Furnished Information (GFI) will
facilitate productive and useful research in a consistent and standardized manner.
Datasets developed by the T&E Team for each program phase will be partitioned into development and
evaluation datasets. Although the T&E Team will deliver development data, Performers may seek to
supplement their own development datasets aggregated from open source or self-generated and using
creative techniques and heuristics to infer classes. These datasets must be submitted to the T&E Team to
be combined into a single dataset, such that it is releasable to all Performers as discussed in 1.D.1.b External
Data Sources.
Evaluation of Performer progress towards program metrics will primarily utilize evaluation datasets that
are sequestered. A portion of these datasets will be shared with Performers after each evaluation to enable
Performers to conduct error analyses. The baseline API provided in Phase 1 will standardize system and
subcomponent design and streamline comparative evaluations. More details on the datasets are available in
1.D. Program Data. and more details on the API are available in 1.G.4 Program API.
1.A.2.a Phase 1
The goal of Phase 1 is to develop new methods and explore the feature space between source code to source
code and binary to binary representations of software. Featurization, similarity matching, and demographic
analytic systems in this phase should succeed at performing rank and retrieval and open search tasks using
inputs of both source code and binary representations. Systems will only be expected to query like
representations (source code to source code, binary to binary) matches against a large corpus of software.
Throughout the first phase of the program, Performer research will focus on foundational explorations and
investigations into different approaches, theories, and concepts to establish the building blocks of their
SoURCE CODE system(s). During this time, performers and the T&E team will collaborate on a protocol 
Page 7 of 64
to evaluate human explainability. This protocol will be implemented towards the end of Phase 1 and carry
into Phase 2 of the program. As a precursor to this collaboration, proposals in response to this BAA must
articulate a novel approach to the explainability challenge, addressing how their SoURCE CODE systems
would furnish explanations to users allowing them to understand and verify system behavior. Two
categories of an end user are envisioned: a non-expert analyst using the system explanations to understand
system rationale, flag spurious attributions, gauge attribution confidence, etc.; and an expert with
sophisticated reverse engineering and forensic, knowledge conducting highly nuanced attribution analysis
of attacks. Offerors must be explicit in their proposals about how their explanatory techniques could be
evaluated. This information will ensure that our testing methodology for explainability will properly
capture any techniques that you are exploring.
With the aims of mitigating risk and investigating competing approaches, performers are encouraged to
pursue several novel approaches under the same subtopic. Performers will compare and contrast various
approaches using development datasets.
1.A.2.b Phase 2
The goal of phase 2 is for Performers to extend the capabilities developed in phase 1. Featurization,
similarity matching, and demographic analytic systems in this phase should succeed at performing rank and
retrieval and open search tasks using inputs of both source code and binary representations. Systems will
be expected to query opposite representations (source code to binary, binary to source code) matches against
a large corpus of software.
1.B Team Expertise
Collaborative efforts and teaming among Offerors are highly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will
be multidisciplinary and shall include expertise in one or more of the disciplines listed below. This list is
included only to provide guidance for the Offerors; satisfying all the areas of technical expertise below is
not a requirement for selection and unconventional or innovative team expertise may be needed based on
the proposed research. Proposals shall include a description and the mix of skills and staffing that the
Offeror determines will be necessary to carry out the proposed research and achieve program metrics.
• Binary Analysis
• Compiler Design
• Software Engineering
• Programming Languages
• Authorship Attribution
• Threat Intelligence Analytics
• Cybersecurity
• Cyber-Forensics & Reverse Engineering
• Stylometry
• Artificial Intelligence
• Machine learning
Although the SoURCE CODE program is focused on automated approaches, teaming schemes that include
meaningful collaborations with forensic experts, software reverse engineers, and practitioners of noncomputational attribution methods are highly encouraged.
Page 8 of 64
1.C Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals shall explicitly address all of the following:
• Underlying theory: Proposed strategies to meet program-specified metrics must have firm
theoretical bases that are described with enough detail that reviewers will be able to assess the
viability of the approaches. Proposals shall properly describe and reference previous work upon
which their approach is founded.
• Research & Development approach: Proposals shall describe the technical approach to meeting
program metrics.
• Technical risks: Proposals shall identify technical risks and proposed mitigation strategies for each
identified risk.
• Software development: Proposals shall describe the approach to software architecture,
modularization, and integration.
The following areas of research are out of scope for the SoURCE CODE program:
• Research that does not have strong theoretical and experimental foundations
• Approaches that rely on features outside of source code or binary executables (e.g. timestamps,
network structure, multimedia, etc.).
• Approaches that rely solely on integration of existing cybersecurity solutions without experimental
or scientific improvements.
• Approaches that focus solely on utilizing features from only the lexical and syntactic domains
• Approaches that rely solely on running the software is out of scope. But we are looking for
innovative approaches to dynamic and static analysis.
• Improving natural language authorship attribution (i.e., for code comments). Use of these systems
is encouraged in addition to the methods being explored, and modifications to existing systems is
allowable only if required to improve code comment specific functionality – but improvement of
natural language attribution techniques is out of scope.
• Development or Analysis of hardware systems
• Approaches that consist merely of integrating currently existing software systems.
• Developing new adversarial approaches to misattribute or cause errors in attribution or
demographic systems.
Performers are permitted to use data outside of the standard data provided by T&E teams, however no
proprietary data should be used. Please include any datasets that you wish to share within your proposal to
the effort. Any additional data from proposers shall be distributed to T&E for dissemination to any and all
selected performers on SoURCE CODE; datasets will not be made public beyond the program teams. We
expect a diverse set of programming languages (such as C, C++, Rust, Python, and so on) and binaries
(ELF, EXE) but details about the final datasets will be shared at kickoff.
Delivered software will be evaluated by the T&E team on sequestered evaluation datasets. During each
performance period, performers will build software systems that will be run and evaluated by the T&E
team. Testing protocols do not allow for expert operators – systems must be fully automated. Systems or
algorithms that have been trained using human-in-the-loop methods may be submitted, provided that they
can be run autonomously. 
Page 9 of 64
1.D. Program Data
The SoURCE CODE program seeks to simulate the challenge of forensic similarity measures from realworld circumstances faced by threat intelligence analysts. Current academic datasets have a number of
shortcomings that render them inadequate to understand the full scope of the challenge program, including:
• Understanding the impact of group codebases vs. a single individual’s code
• Understanding the impact and influences of project domains (e.g. Android vs. iOS vs. Windows
vs. Linux)
• Understanding the impacts and influences of development tools:
o Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
o Version Control Systems
o Compiler choices
o Build Environment
o Deployment tools
o Novel concepts proposed by performers
• And the impact of things like company style guides or project naming conventions.
SoURCE CODE Test and Evaluation teams will be seeking to fill some of these gaps through curation of
datasets, annotating datasets, and/or building datasets to fill these gaps. Ground truth in these datasets will
represent a diverse set of demographic data (with minimally country, group, author). Many types of
malware will be considered within the datasets, which may include packed malware or malware with other
obfuscation techniques. More details about the datasets will be provided at program kickoff.
The program will include two types of data – Development Data and Evaluation Data. Development data
will be utilized by Performers, as they see fit, to conduct research, development, error analysis, and
algorithm training. Evaluation data will be explicitly excluded from any algorithm training approaches and
will be used by the T&E Team for performance evaluations of subcomponents, modules, and systems
measured against the SoURCE CODE program metrics.
Offerors may include datasets that they may own if such data is not proprietary and can be shared among
all selected performers.
1.D.1 Development Data
Development data will be utilized by Performers, as they see fit, to conduct internal research, development,
error analysis, and algorithm training. Each Performer is anticipated to have a unique technical solution,
and accordingly may require different development data depending on their approach.
Datasets will be collected, annotated, and curated by the T&E Team. Some of this data may be sequestered,
and a portion will be provided to Performers for R&D and error analysis.
1.D.1.a Government Research and Evaluation Data
The T&E team will curate, annotate, and collect datasets to be made available to SoURCE CODE
performers. Some data will be sequestered for the purpose of blind testing and evaluation. The government
team will also work to augment these datasets with a collection effort to create human-authored groundtruthed source code and binary executable software and will provide some of this data upon anonymization
and availability of the data in accordance with any appropriate Human Subject Research authorities.
Page 10 of 64
1.D.1.b Performer Supplemented Data Sources
Performers may propose to utilize external datasets obtained by Performers that are available from third
parties or that have been collected by the Performer outside of the SoURCE CODE program. An example
of a third-party dataset would be an authorship attribution dataset, collected by a university under an IRBapproved HSR protocol, that has been approved by the dataset owner for release to the research community.
Data collected by a Performer under a different program are considered external data, even if the other
program’s data collection was Government-sponsored.
All external datasets must be approved for use in the SoURCE CODE program by IARPA during contract
performance, in accordance with HSR and applicable privacy policies, statutes, and regulations. As part of
their proposal, Offeror’s shall prepare a SoURCE CODE Privacy Plan v1.0 that comprehensively describes
the efforts the Offeror will take to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and United States
Persons (USP) information, and safeguard the security of any personal data collected and that of any
devices, applications, networks, or services involved in collection, transmission, processing, and storage of
such data.
This plan shall include but is not limited to: 1) All performers shall provide to the Government annual
privacy training certificates of completion for all personnel on this effort to document and instill the
importance of data protections, 2) creation of a data protection plan that addresses the performer’s
safeguarding approach i.e, for encrypting the data at rest and in motion for any PII and/or USP data, and 3)
Notifying the IARPA Program Manager and Contracting Officer when there is any data spill or leak. Any
claims that data are anonymous must be based on evidence and supported with sufficient information
regarding how the data have been anonymized. Each Performer’s SoURCE CODE Privacy Plan shall cover
all data categories described in this BAA; relevant information on GFI datasets will be provided by
SoURCE CODE T&E in advance of data release.
Performers may not use proprietary datasets unless these datasets are made available to all R&D performers
and the T&E Team in the SoURCE CODE program. Public release of proprietary datasets is not a
requirement; however, release for use within the SoURCE CODE program is required. Moreover, for any
dataset not collected under the scope of the SoURCE CODE program, performers must provide the
Government with an accounting of all resources used and sources from which data are drawn and describe
how the data will be used for development, testing, and training of algorithms.
1.E Testing & Evaluation
T&E will be conducted by an independent team of Government and contractor staff carrying out evaluation
and analyses of performer research deliverables using program test datasets and protocols. The SoURCE
CODE data and test protocols (see 1.D.1.a Government Research and Evaluation Data) will be the primary
mechanism by which the T&E team carries out their evaluations.
The SoURCE CODE program will pursue rigorous and comprehensive T&E to ensure that research
outcomes are well characterized, deliverables are aligned with program objectives, and that the algorithm
performance is measured across a full range of conditions. Such T&E activities will inform IARPA and
Government stakeholders on SoURCE CODE research progress and serve as invaluable feedback to
performers to improve their research approaches, algorithmic training, and system development. The
SoURCE CODE program will work closely with government leaders in malware analysis and reverse
engineering to refine and improve the T&E methodologies.
The government will provide performers with a uniform Evaluation Harness (EH) application programming
interface (API) – to be provided at program kick-off - with relevant scripts to run program test protocols on
program datasets. The design of the EH will be informed by prior work conducted by the T&E team and 
Page 11 of 64
other government agencies. This evaluation environment will be the platform for independent government
testing of performer deliverables.
Figure 5. Test and Evaluation. T&E team will provide and interface (e.g. Docker Containers / APIs) that will be used to automate the testing. Offerors will
submit their feature space and similarity/demographic algorithms for independent testing and be tested for feature invariance or compared against baseline
systems.
Performers will have specific deliverable milestones at which all subcomponent, system algorithms, and
software will be delivered to IARPA and its designated T&E Team. The T&E Team will then conduct
evaluations at the direction of the SoURCE CODE Program Manager (PM) and with the objective of
characterizing the quality, functionality, and performance of the SoURCE CODE deliverables. In addition
to quantitative measurements, T&E will be carried out to establish a thorough understanding of the progress,
status, and limitations of the performer’s research.
T&E results and feedback will be provided to performers at regular intervals to keep them abreast of current
independent performance measurements and to inform and improve their R&D approaches and methods.
T&E results from all performers will be shared with all teams to establish an understanding of the current
state and progress of SoURCE CODE research; T&E results will also be shared with government
stakeholders, including their contractors, for Government purposes. For example, a Principal Investigator
(PI) Review Meeting will be held annually to share research ideas, progress, and results across the SoURCE
CODE program (see 1.G.2 Program Milestones and Deliverable timelines).
IARPA may conduct other supplemental evaluations or measurements in its sole discretion to evaluate the
Performers’ research and Deliverables.
1.F Program Metrics
Achievement of metrics is a performance indicator under IARPA research programs. IARPA has defined
SoURCE CODE program metrics to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed solutions in achieving the stated
program goal and objectives, and to determine whether satisfactory progress is being made. The metrics
described in this BAA are shared with the intent to scope the effort, while affording maximum flexibility,
creativity, and innovation to Offerors proposing solutions to the stated problem.
Page 12 of 64
The final SoURCE CODE T&E protocols and evaluation methodology will be provided at program kickoff.
Program metrics may be refined during the various phases of the SoURCE CODE program; if metrics
change, revised metrics will be communicated in a timely manner to Performers. The evaluation
methodology may be revised by the Government at any time during the program lifecycle to better meet
program needs.
SoURCE CODE program target metrics were selected based on three factors:
1. What is technically achievable but challenging based on current state-of-the-art in software
similarity measurements;
2. What is statistically measurable based on the planned program evaluation data; and
3. What is useful to mission partners based on USG stakeholder needs and use cases.
The following is a description of primary program metrics and target scores. Score targets will increase for
each successive program phase. SoURCE CODE performance metrics are designed to evaluate the software
component deliverables for similarity and demographic tasks.
Performer software submissions for similarity and demographic estimation tasks are evaluated using
standard machine learning classification metrics – along with standard biometric measures, such as d’. The
recognition task tests whether a system can use a query document from a given author, group, country (or
other demographic data) and retrieve documents from a set of documents produced by the same author or
documents most likely from the same demographic class. At test time, the Performer system must generate
feature encodings for a set of author query documents as well as documents from a retrieval database. Using
Performer system generated encodings, the T&E Team will retrieve a ranked list of nearest neighbors for
each author query. The program does not place constraints on the properties of the feature space; however,
teams must stipulate an encoding that allows calculation of similarity.
Specific metrics of interest include: Top-N accuracy (specifically Top-1 and Top-10) which are used to
measure the success of the system in bubbling up documents from the demographic class being tests.
(Accuracy is chosen over Recall as proper classification of negative samples is also important).
Additionally, Equal Error Rate (EER) is to be calculated as a measure of the Receiver Operating Curve
(ROC) – a measure of the point where False accept and False Reject errors are equal. In a similar vein,
measurements of the d-prime (d′) measure is necessary to determine the discriminability between the
“genuine” and “imposter” signals to assist in determining if feature representations are viable for these
problems. Additional metrics may be calculated, to understand the challenge of the task and how well
performer systems are performing on the tasks.
A summary of metric targets by phase is shown in Table 2 for similarity metrics and Table 3 for estimating
demographic trait metrics; these metrics are subject to change over the course of the program. Accuracy
targets are defined as aggregated statistical measures for a given phases’ evaluation datasets, which will
contain binaries and source code from a broad range of software types, build systems / compilers, and
authors with a diverse background in software development. These targets are estimates informed by
current capabilities and use case requirements. To mitigate risk and better inform the Government regarding
the appropriateness of phase-over-phase performance targets, the T&E Team will produce baseline systems
for each task approximating current state-of-the-art. Further information about baseline models will be
furnished to Performers at program kickoff.

1.G.1 Waypoints
Waypoints are the means by which the Performer clearly demonstrates the quantitative and timely progress
that must be made for the overall concept to meet end-of-phase Milestones. In other words, the intent of
Waypoints is to provide a clear measure of progress towards meeting the program Milestones so the PM
and advisors can provide more effective guidance and assistance to the Performers. Performance against
these Waypoints will be reviewed throughout the program, and the PM and advisors will use performance
against the Waypoints to assess whether course corrections are needed to ensure program success.
The Government has defined Waypoints for all Performers that are included in the Program Milestones and
Deliverables (see 1.G.2 Program Milestones and Deliverable timelines). Progress against these Waypoints
will be reviewed during site visits.

1.G.3 Software Deliverable Formatting
Performers will be required to provide algorithms, software deliverables, design documentation, and
operating instructions to execute the automated software in a manner that conforms to a standardized
industrial method or methods that will be provided at program Kickoff. To facilitate planning, offerors may
assume that the standardized configuration will require the use of software containerization technology
(e.g., Docker and a REST API). This means that the entirety of a Performer’s system, including pre- and
post-processing, must be included within the delivered software container. For models that require training,
the expectation is for the initial model training to occur on Performer systems, with the ability for the T&E
Team to re-train and test the model with the same and/or other data. Performers shall also provide source
code to the government and T&E team to enable modification of Performer containers to suit deployment
constraints. Offeror teams that do not include the requisite expertise to conduct such software development 
Page 16 of 64
shall include costs in their proposal to obtain software development support.
Each team is required to include among their key personnel a Lead System Integrator (LSI) who shall be
responsible for preparing software Deliverable subcomponents, modules, and systems, performing quality
control of Deliverable, and integrating key components into the primary SoURCE CODE system(s). The
LSI will also oversee communication and coordination across a Performer’s research teams including
subcontractors, if applicable, to ensure research products are functional and following software coding best
practices (e.g., inline comments, documentation). Additional team members and roles are dependent on the
proposed research, as such, there is no predetermined or required skill mix.
1.G.4 Program API
The SoURCE CODE Program will utilize a standardized Application Programming Interface (API) for all
software Deliverables and evaluations. The first version of the SoURCE CODE API will be provided to
Performers at the Phase 1 Kick-off Meeting and updated periodically thereafter. The API will define
function calls, data structures, and display creation and management for operating and evaluating SoURCE
CODE software in a standardized manner. All Performer solutions must be compatible with the SoURCE
CODE API.
1.H. Meeting and Travel Requirements
Offerors are expected to assume responsibility for administration of their projects and to comply with
contractual and program requirements for reporting, attendance at program workshops, and availability for
site visits. The following paragraphs describe typical expectations for meetings and travel for IARPA
programs as well as the contemplated frequency and locations of such meetings. In addition to ensuring
that all necessary details of developed software, algorithm, and operational instructions are clear and
complete, each Performer will be required to be available for questions and troubleshooting from the T&E
Team in Performer status meetings.
1.H.1 Technical Exchange Meetings and Workshops
All Performer teams are expected to attend Technical Exchange meetings and workshops, including key
personnel from prime and subcontractor organizations.
The SoURCE CODE program intends to hold a program Kick-off Meeting workshop in the first month of
the program and the first month of each subsequent program phase. In addition, the program will hold a PI
Review Meeting starting in Phase 1 and then similar workshops at least annually thereafter. Kick-off
Meetings and PI Review Meetings may be combined for logistical convenience. The dates and locations of
these meetings are to be specified at a later date by the Government, but for planning purposes, Offerors
should use the approximate times and locations listed in Table 5. Both types of meetings are likely be held
in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, but IARPA may opt to co-locate the meeting with a relevant
external conference or workshop to increase synergy with stakeholders. IARPA reserves the right to hold
the meeting virtually for logistical or health and safety reasons.
Kick-off Meetings will typically be one day in duration and will focus on plans for the coming Phase,
Performer planned research, and internal program discussions. PI Review Meetings will typically be two
days in duration and will have a greater focus on communicating program progress and plans to USG
stakeholders. These meetings will include additional time allocated to presentation and discussion of
research accomplishments as well as interactive system demonstrations for Government stakeholders.
In both cases, the workshops will focus on technical aspects of the program and on facilitating open
technical exchanges, interaction, and sharing among the various program participants. Program participants 
Page 17 of 64
will be expected to present the technical status and progress of their projects to other participants and invited
guests. Individual sessions for each performer team with the SoURCE CODE PM and T&E Team may be
scheduled to coincide with these workshops. Non-proprietary information will be shared by performers in
the open meeting sessions; proprietary information sharing shall occur during individual breakout sessions
with the SoURCE CODE PM and the T&E Team.
1.H.2. Site Visits
Our expectation is that Site visits by the Government Team to all performers will take place semiannually
during the life of the program. These visits will occur at the Performer’s facility. Reports on technical
progress, details of successes and issues, contributions to the program goals, and technology demonstrations
will be expected at such site visits. Performers shall participate and provide final meeting documents, to
include captured action items, within 15 calendar days following the meeting. Draft materials, for any
presentations, are due 5 workdays prior to the meeting. IARPA reserves the right to conduct additional site
visits on an as-needed basis.
1.I. Period of Performance
The SoURCE CODE program is envisioned as a 30-month effort intended to kick-off in July 2024. Phase
1 (Base Period) of the program will last 18 months; Phase 2 (Option Period 1) will last 12 months. Offerors
are required to submit a proposal that addresses both phases of the program.
1.J. Place of Performance
Work for the SoURCE CODE program will be conducted at the Performers’ sites.

SECTION 2: AWARD INFORMATION
The Government intends to award contracts encompassing either only the unclassified TA1 portion of the
effort, or all Technical Areas (TA1, TA2, and TA3, reference Section 4.A). Exercise of the Option Periods
shall depend upon performance during Phase 1 - Base Period and subsequent Option Periods, if any, as
well as program goals, the availability of funding, and IARPA priorities. Exercising of Phase 2 – Option
Period 1 is at the sole discretion of the Government.
Multiple awards are anticipated. The resources made available under this BAA shall depend on the
quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.
The Government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in
response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with Offerors. The Government also
reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be necessary. Additionally, IARPA reserves the
right to accept proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of proposals for negotiations for award.
Evaluation and award of proposals will follow FAR 35 processes as described herein.
Awards under this BAA shall be made to Offerors on the basis of the Evaluation Factors listed in
Section 5 of the BAA, as well as successful completion of negotiations. Proposals selected for negotiation
may result in a procurement contract or other transaction. The Government reserves the right to negotiate
Page 18 of 64
the type of award instrument (e.g., procurement contract or other transaction) it determines appropriate
under the circumstances.
The Government shall contact Offerors whose proposals are selected for negotiations to obtain additional
information required for award. The Government may establish a deadline for the close of fact-finding and
negotiations that allows a reasonable time for the award of a contract. Offerors that are not responsive to
Government deadlines established and communicated with the request may be removed from award
consideration. Offerors may also be removed from award consideration should the parties fail to reach
agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms, conditions, and cost/price.
SECTION 3: ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION
3.A. Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal. Historically
Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, and Minority
Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit proposals; however, no
portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the
impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this R&D effort for exclusive competition among
these entities. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development
Centers(FFRDCs), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), Government-Owned, ContractorOperated facilities (GOCO), Government Military Academies, and any other similar type of organization2
that have a special relationship with the Government, that gives them access to privileged and/or
proprietary information or access to Government equipment or real property, are not eligible to submit
proposals under this BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities.
An entity of which only a portion has been designated as a UARC may be eligible to submit a proposal or
participate as a team member, subject to an organizational conflict of interest review.
For vendors who are ONLY proposing to the unclassified TA1 portion of this effort: Foreign entities
and/or individuals may participate, but only as a part of a U.S. based team. The prime contractor
must be a U.S. organization. Foreign entities and individuals may participate as subcontractors or
employees of a U.S. organization; however, all foreign participation must comply with any necessary NonDisclosure Agreements, Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes
applicable under the circumstances. Offerors are expected to ensure that the efforts of foreign participants
do not either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the United States, nor its security interests. As
such, both foreign and domestic Offerors should carefully consider the roles and responsibilities of foreign
participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.
For vendors who are proposing to all Technical Areas – TA1 and the classified Areas, TA 2 and
TA3, of this effort: Entities under unmitigated Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI)
and/or foreign individuals are NOT eligible to participate in the CLASSIFIED aspects of program,
in any capacity. This restriction extends to both classified technical and administrative support roles for
the classified technical areas. This restriction does not extend to unclassified technical and administrative
support roles for the unclassified technical area. This restriction also extends to foreign national US
Person-green card holders employed by U.S.-based organizations. All personnel supporting
2 There are instances when these types of entities provide a unique facility, specialized equipment or technical service
that is not otherwise obtainable. In such cases, Offerors can request use and the Government will determine if the
resource can be made available to all Offerors as Government Furnished Property/Equipment/Information/Service.
If the resource requested cannot be provided directly by the Government, the Government may consider an Offeror’s
request for limited use as a procured service not otherwise available only after an OCI review and determination. It
is advised that the Offeror have an alternate plan in its proposal in case the Government does not accept the proposed
participation. Requests for such resources can be submitted during the Q&A period.
Page 19 of 64
the classified aspects of the program, directly or indirectly, must be a US Citizen. These restrictions
extend to subcontractors and/or lower-tier subcontractors for the classified aspects of the program. This
does NOT preclude the involvement of foreign nationals in the unclassified aspects of the program (TA1),
but vendors security plans shall explain how they are going to ensure classified aspects of the program are
properly protected from foreign nationals on TA1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM),
IARPA intends to contract with offerors inclusive of subcontractors and/or lower-tier subcontractors which
are not under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI), to avoid any issues which may, in the
opinion of IARPA, adversely affect security requirements. Notwithstanding the limitation on contracting
with an offeror under FOCI, IARPA reserves the right to contract with entities with mitigated FOCI under
a pre-existing Special Security Agreement upon conclusion of an assessment that finds participation in
SoURCE CODE to be in the best interest of IARPA.
3.A.1 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI)
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” means that because of other activities or
relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or
advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be
otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
In accordance with FAR 9.5, Offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to potential
OCIs involving the Offeror’s organization and any proposed team member (sub awardee, consultant).
Under this Section, the Offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each proposal submitted
pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Offeror’s, and as applicable, proposed team
member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include a description of the actions the
Offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the
Offeror’s judgment and to prevent the Offeror from having an unfair competitive advantage. The OCI
mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI in the context of each of the OCI limitations
outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits contractors/Performers from concurrently providing Scientific Engineering
Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar support services and
being a technical Performer. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement above, address
whether an Offeror or an Offeror’s team member (e.g., sub awardee, consultant) is providing SETA,
A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under: (a) a current award or subaward; or (b) a
past award or subaward.
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal must include:
• The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
• The prime contract number;
• Identification of proposed team member (sub awardee, consultant) providing the support.
As part of their proposal, Offerors shall include either (a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates have any
potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in Appendix A.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise selectable under
the BAA Evaluation Factors.
The Government may require Offerors to provide additional information to assist the Government in
evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans.
Page 20 of 64
If the Government determines that an Offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide the
affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional information
requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the Offeror’s OCI and proposed OCI mitigation plan,
the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for award.
3.A.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Organizations may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the BAA.
However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are selected, such
common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can be paid twice to
perform the same task).
3.B. U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods or services
with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the sponsorship of such
contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or arrangements with academic
institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate officials of the institution.”
Offerors must submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter for each
U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is serving in the
role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their technical proposal.
Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g., President, Chancellor, Provost, or
other appropriately designated official). A template of the Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter
is enclosed in APPENDIX A of this BAA. Note that IARPA shall not enter into negotiations with an
Offeror whose team includes a U.S. academic institution until all required Academic Institution
Acknowledgment Letters are received.
3. C. Other Eligibility Criteria
3. C.1 Collaboration Efforts
Collaborative efforts and teaming arrangements among potential Offerors are strongly encouraged.
Specific content, communications, networking and team formations are the sole responsibility of the
participants.
SECTION 4: DOCUMENT PREPARATION PRE-APPROVAL, PROPOSAL, AND
SUBMISSION INFORMATION
This notice constitutes the total BAA and contains all information required to submit a proposal for TA1.
No additional forms, kits, or other materials are required. If offeror intends to propose to classified
portions of this BAA, TA 2 and TA3, they must request and be approved to receive the Classified
Addendum.
It is essential that interested offerors carefully review SECTION 4: DOCUMENT PREPARATION PREAPPROVAL, PROPOSAL, AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION for instructions on obtaining approval
for preparing and submitting classified proposals and required security material to be included with
submissions.
Offerors will be required to and shall submit a Security Plan as part of their classified proposals which is
detailed in SECTION 4.B.1.d ATTACHMENTS. IARPA will evaluate the Security Plan as a component 
Page 21 of 64
of Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan.
The Government anticipates that the classified proposals submitted in response to TA2 & TA3 of this
BAA will be classified at a minimum SECRET//NOFORN level. Potential offerors must review the
SoURCE CODE Security Classification Guide (SC SCG) to appropriately mark any classified materials
to be submitted under this BAA.
4.A Approval to Receive Classified Addendum and Prepare and Submit a Classified
Proposal
Upon a request for the classified Addendum, IARPA must grant approval to receive, prepare and submit a
classified proposal(s). To obtain this approval, please submit the following:

submission methods and these will be provided separately.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 of the NISPOM, the Government intends to secure services
from entities that are not under unmitigated foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI), See Section
3.A.
IARPA will notify each offeror it approves to prepare and submit a classified proposal. Please note that
offerors must have this approval before preparing classified portions of their proposal. Failure to
obtain timely approval may effectively disqualify proposers from responding to the classified aspects of
this program (TA 2 and 3). The due date for receipt of Proposal Preparation Requests is November 30,
2023 5:00 PM EST. UPDATE: The due date for receipt of Proposal Preparation Requests for the
classified addendum is Friday, January 5, 2024 @ 5:00 PM EST. Requests submitted after this date
may be considered by IARPA, but all other BAA due dates shall remain unchanged, unless specifically

A single preparation approval allows for multiple proposals to be prepared at that physical location using 
Page 22 of 64
the approved computing resources. A separate preparation approval is required for each physical location
to be used by the Offeror in preparing proposal(s).
IARPA will not accept a classified proposal without this pre-approval.
4. A. 2 Proposal Information
Interested Offerors are required to submit full proposals (Volume I, initially and Volume 2, if requested) in
order to receive consideration for an award. Compliant proposals shall be received by the time and date
specified in the BAA, General Information, item 7.4, Proposal Due Date. It is within IARPA’s sole
discretion whether to evaluate any proposals received after this date. Selection for award remains
contingent on the technical and funding availability evaluation factors.
The Government intends to use Booz Allen Hamilton, Crimson Phoenix, SiteWorks, and Navstar Inc. to
provide expert advice, regarding portions of the proposals submitted to the Government and/or to provide
logistical support in carrying out the evaluation process.
In addition to supporting evaluations, the following entities: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
Sandia National Laboratories, and Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University will be
supporting T&E activities for contracts awarded under this program and should also be considered as part
of an Offeror’s OCI disclosure.
All Government and Contractor personnel shall have signed and be subject to the terms and conditions of
non-disclosure agreements. By submission of its proposal, an Offeror agrees that its proposal information
may be disclosed to employees of these organizations for the limited purposes stated above. Offerors who
object to this arrangement shall provide clear notice of their objection as part of their transmittal letter. If
Offerors do not send notice of objection to this arrangement in their transmittal letter, the Government
shall assume consent to the use of contractor support personnel in assisting the review of submittal(s)
under this BAA.
Only Government personnel will make evaluation and award determinations under this BAA.
All unclassified correspondence and questions regarding this solicitation shall be directed by email to
DNI-IARPA-BAA-24-02@iarpa.gov. Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the procedures
stated in the BAA.
4. B. Proposal Format and Content
To facilitate the evaluation of the proposal, the government encourages Offerors to submit proposals
which: are clear and concise; are limited to essential matters sufficient to demonstrate a complete
understanding of the Government’s requirements; include sufficient detail for effective evaluation; and
provide a convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements and
objectives, rather than simply rephrasing or restating the Government’s requirements and objectives.
All proposals shall be in the format outlined below. Non-compliant proposals may be rejected without
review. Proposals shall consist of “Volume 1 - Technical and Management Proposal” and, only if
requested (see BAA sections 4.B.2 and 5.B.), “Volume 2 - Cost Proposal.” All proposals shall be written
in English.
Additionally, text should be black and paper size 8-1/2 by 11-inch, white in color with 1” margins from
paper edge to text or graphic on all sides. Submissions shall use Times New Roman, Liberation Serif, or a
metrically equivalent font with font size not smaller than 12-point. IARPA desires that the font size for
figures, tables and charts not be smaller than 10-point. All contents shall be clearly legible with the
unaided eye. Excessive use of small font, for other than figures, tables, and charts, or unnecessary use of
figures, tables, and charts to present information may render the proposal non-compliant. Text and
graphics, if applicable, may be printed on both sides of a sheet (double-sided). Front and backside of a
single sheet are counted as two (2) pages if both sides are printed upon. Foldout pages are not permitted.
Page 23 of 64
The page limitation for full proposals includes all figures, tables, and charts. All pages should be
numbered. No other materials may be incorporated in any portion of the proposal by reference, as a means
to circumvent page count limitations. All information pertaining to a volume shall be contained within that
volume. Any information beyond the page limitations will not be considered in the evaluation of
Offerors.
The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA for TA1 only will be UNCLASSIFIED;
Proposals submitted under this BAA encompassing all TAs including the classified TA2 and
TA3 portions will be SECRET//NOFORN.

the effort, along with the associated task number responsibilities for each individual.
F. Technical Resource Summary: (NOTE: The full Cost Volume is not required unless requested by
the Contracting Officer (CO); therefore, it is critical that Offerors address the items below in
their technical proposal so the Government can evaluate Resource Realism.)
• Summarize the total level of effort by labor category/technical discipline (e.g., Research
scientist/chemist/physicist/engineer/administrative) and affiliation (e.g., prime/subcontractor/
consultant). All Key Personnel and significant contributors shall be identified by name. Provide
a brief description of the qualifications for each labor category/technical discipline (e.g.,
education, certifications, years of experience).
• Summarize level of effort by labor category/technical discipline for each major task.
• Identify software and IP required for performance, by affiliation. List each item separately,
identifying the task number for which the software or IP is required and the Performer team
requiring it.
• Identify materials or equipment (such as IT) required for performance. List each item separately,
identifying the task number for which the material or equipment is required and the Performer
team requiring it.
• Identify any other resourcesrequired to perform (e.g.,services, data sets, data set repository,
facilities, Government furnished property). List each item separately, identifying the task number
for these other resources are required and the Performer team requiring it.
• Estimated travel, including purpose of travel and number of personnel per trip, by affiliation. (See
Appendix B.4 for sample template)
The above information shall cross reference to the tasks set forth in the Offeror’s statement of work, and
shall be supported by the detailed cost and pricing information provided in the Offeror’s Volume 2 Cost
Proposal, the latter of which shall be submitted only if requested.
4. B.1.c. Section 3: Detailed Proposal Information
This section of the proposal shall provide the detailed, in-depth discussion of the proposed research as
well as supporting information about the Offeror’s capabilities and resources. Specific attention shall be
given to addressing both the risks and payoffs of the proposed research and why the proposed research
will achieve the goals, objectives, metrics, and milestones in this BAA. The Government reserves the
right to reject a proposal if the information requested below is not adequately addressed. This part shall
provide:
A. Statement of Work (SOW) - Clearly define the technical tasks and sub-tasks to be performed,
their durations and the dependencies among them. For each task and sub-task, provide:
• A general description of the objective;
Page 26 of 64
• A detailed description of the approach to be taken, developed in an orderly progression and
in enough detail to establish the feasibility of accomplishing the goals of the task;
• Identification of the primary organization responsible for task execution (prime, subcontractor, team member, etc.) by name;
• The exit criteria for each task/activity (i.e., a product, event or milestone that defines its
completion); and
• Identification of all deliverables (e.g., data rights, reports, software) to be provided to the
Government.
Note: Do not include any proprietary information in the SOW
At the end of this section of the proposal, provide a Gantt chart, showing all the tasks and subtasks on the left (grouped by research thrust, if applicable) with the performance period (in
years/quarters) on the right. All milestones shall be clearly labeled on the chart. If necessary, use
multiple pages to ensure legibility of all information.
B. A detailed description of the objectives, scientific relevance, technical approach and expected
significance of the work. Clearly identify the key elements of the proposed work and how they
relate to each other. Describe the technical methods or approaches that will be used to meet or
exceed each program milestone along with an explanation outlining why the proposed
methods/approaches are feasible. Additionally, describe any anticipated risks along with possible
mitigations. Proposals containing only a general discussion of the problem without detailed
description of approaches, plausibility of implementation, and critical metrics may be deemed
not selectable.
C. State-of-the-art. Compare with the proposed approach to other on-going research, highlighting the
uniqueness of the proposed approach and differences between the proposed effort and the
current state-of-the-art. Identify advantages and disadvantages of the proposed work with respect
to potential alternative approaches.
D. Data sources. Identify and describe data sources to be utilized in pursuit of the stated research
goals.
Offerors proposing to use existing data sets shall provide written verification that said data sets
were obtained in accordance with U.S. laws and, where applicable, use will be in compliance
with End User License Agreements, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies
regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Offerors proposing to obtain new data sets shall
ensure that their plan for obtaining the data complies with U.S. Laws and, where applicable, with
End User License Agreement, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies
regarding privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Offerors shall also address IP restrictions on the use
or transfer of such data sets, in Attachment 2 of the Offeror’s proposal, as described in Section
4.B.1.d.
Offerors shall also include the documentation required in 6.B.3 (Human Use) in Attachment 7.
Documentation must be well written and logical; claims for exemptions from Federal regulations
for human subject protection must be accompanied by a strong defense of the claims. The Human
Use documentation and the written verification are not included in the total page count.
E. Deliverables. Based on the required deliverables identified in Section 1 of the BAA, clearly
identify the data to be delivered, including technical data and computer software. In Attachment 2
to Offeror’s proposal, Offerors shall address IP rights in such data, as described in Section
4.B.1.d.

J. Resource Share. Include the type of support, if any, the Offeror might request from the
Government, such as facilities, equipment, materials, or any such resources the Offeror is willing
to provide at no additional cost to the Government to support the research effort. Cost sharing is
not required from Offerors and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a
reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and
development effort.
K. The names of other federal, state or local agencies or other parties receiving the proposal and/or
funding the proposed effort. If none, state “None”. Concurrent submission of the proposal to other
organizations will not prejudice its review but may impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort.
See 5.A.2.a.
L. Research Data Management Plan. (RDMP). Submit a RDMP (See Attachment 11 as a template)
that outlines how they will manage and preserve the Research Data, as defined below, collected
or produced through the course of performance. Offerors may state in their proposal that their
RDMP is contained in Attachment 11, which does not count against the 25-page limit. The
RDMP need not require the preservation of all Research Data: Offerors shall consider the cost
and benefits of managing and preserving the Research Data in determining whether to preserve it.
At a minimum, all Research Data associated with a peer-reviewed manuscript or final published
article (hereinafter “Publications”) must be made publicly accessible by the award recipient
before, on or at a reasonable time after the publication date. The Publications whose associated
data must be covered by the RDMP are deliverables as described in Section 1.
Research Data is defined herein as the digital recorded factual material commonly accepted in the
scientific community as necessary to validate research findings including data sets used to
support scholarly publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses,
drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports, communications with
colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens.
The RDMP must address the following:
• Describe the types of Research Data collected or produced in the course of the project.
Include standards to be used for Research Data and metadata content and format.
• A plan for making the Research Data that underlie Publications digitally accessible to the
public before or, at the time of publication or conference presentation, or within a reasonable
time after publication. The requirement could be met by including the data as supplementary
information to the Publication or by depositing the Research Data in a searchable, machinereadable and digitally accessible form suitable for repositories available to the public free of
charge. Such repositories could be discipline-specific repositories, general purpose research 
Page 29 of 64
data repositories or institutional repositories. The published article or conference paper
should indicate how the public may access Research Data underlying the paper’s results and
findings. Offerors should attempt to make the Research Data available for at least three years
after published article or conference. (NOTE: Offerors shall make a best effort in identifying
research data sets that may be used for Publications that occur after contract end. The Offeror
shall deliver these data sets to the Government and make them available in repositories
available to the public prior to the end of the period of performance, if not included as
supplementary information to Publications.)
• Policies and provisions for sharing and preservation, including a) policies and provisions for
appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, and IP, b) descriptions of tools,
including software, needed to access and interpret the Research Data, and c) policies and
provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and production of derivatives.
• If, for legitimate reasons (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, security, IP rights considerations; size
of data sets, cost; time), the Research Data underlying the results of peer-reviewed
publications or conference papers cannot be shared and preserved, the plan must include a
justification citing such reasons.
In addressing these elements (e.g., types of data to be shared and preserved, standards to be used
for data and metadata, repositories to be used for archiving data, timeframes for sharing and
preservation), the RDMP should reflect the best practices of the relevant scientific discipline and
research community. At a minimum, Research Data underlying Publications and associated
metadata shall include an acknowledgement of IARPA support and a link to the associated
Publication.
4.B.1.d. Section 4: Attachments
[NOTE: The attachments listed below shall be included with the proposal, if applicable, but do not
count against the Volume 1-page limit.]
Attachment 1: Signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter(s) (if applicable). A template is
provided in Appendix A.
Attachment 2: IP Rights. A template is provided in Appendix A. This attachment is estimated not to
exceed 4 pages and shall address the following:
Representation as to Rights. An Offeror shall provide a good faith representation that they either
own or have sufficient licensing rights to all IP that will be utilized under their proposal.
Program-Specific IP Approach. IARPA requires sufficient rights to IP developed or used in the
conduct of the proposed research to ensure that IARPA can successfully (a) manage the program
and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, (b) communicate program information across
Government organizations, and (c) support transition to and further use and development of the
program results by IC users and others. IARPA anticipates that achieving these goals for the
SoURCE CODE program will necessitate a minimum of Unlimited Rights in all deliverables.
However, there may be any number of other approaches to intellectual property rights to achieve
IARPA’s program goals. As outlined in FAR 52.227-14, “Unlimited rights” means the rights of
the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the
public, and perform publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have
or permit others to do so. In addressing their approach to IP rights, Offerors should (1) describe the
intended use of patented invention(s) or data, including, technical data and computer software, in
the conduct of the proposed research; (2) describe the rights being offered to the Government
along with a justification if less than Unlimited Rights is being offered; (3) explain how IARPA
will be able to reach its program goals (including transition) with the rights offered to the
Government; (4) identify the cost to the Government to acquire additional or alternative rights 
Page 30 of 64
beyond those being offered, if applicable; and (5) provide possible alternatives in any area in
which the offered rights may be insufficient for IARPA to achieve its program goals (e.g., the
possibility of future licensing of privately-developed software to U.S. Government agencies at a
reasonable cost.)
Patented Inventions. Offerors shall include documentation using the format provided in
Appendix A, proving ownership of or sufficient rights to all inventions (or inventions for which a
patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under the proposal for the IARPA program.
If a patent application has been filed for an invention that the proposal intends to utilize, but the
application has not yet been made publicly available and contains proprietary information, the
Offeror may provide only the serial number, inventor name(s), assignee names (if any), filing date,
filing date of any related provisional application, and a summary of the patent title, together with
either: (1) a representation that the Offeror owns the invention, or (2) proof of sufficient licensing
rights in the invention. Offerors shall also indicate their intention to incorporate patented
technology into any deliverable- i.e., if Offerors intend for any deliverable to embody any
invention covered by any patent or patent application the Offerors listed in Volume 1, Attachment
2, Offerors shall also specify in the Attachment the deliverable into which the Offerors expects to
incorporate the invention. In doing so, the Government requests that Offerors further specify any
rights offered to the Government for inventions that will be utilized in the program (beyond the
implied license that accompanies a patent owner’s sale of a patented product).
Noncommercial Data. Offerors shall identify all noncommercial data, including technical data and
computer software, that it plans to generate, develop and/or deliver under any proposed award
instrument in which the Government shall acquire less than unlimited rights. In doing so, Offerors
must assert (a) the specific restrictions the Government’s rights in those deliverables, (b) the basis
for such restrictions, (c) the intended use of the technical data and noncommercial computer
software in the conduct of the proposed research and development of applicable deliverables, and
(d) a supporting rationale of why the proposed approach to data rights is in the Government’s best
interest (please see program specific goals above). If no restrictions are intended, then the
Offeror shall state “NONE.”
Commercial Data. Offerors shall identify all commercial data, including technical data and
commercial computer software, that may be included in any deliverables contemplated under the
research effort and assert any applicable restrictions on the Government’s use of such commercial
data (please see program specific goals above). If no restrictions are intended, then the
Proposer shall state “NONE.”
Data Developed with Mixed Funding. If mixed funding is anticipated in data generated,
developed, and/or delivered under the research effort, the Government seeks at minimum
“Government Purpose Rights” (GPR) for all noncommercial data deliverables; offering anything
less shall be considered a weakness in the proposal. United States Government purposes include
any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements
with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States
Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include
competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform,
display, or disclose technical data or computer software for commercial purposes or authorize
others to do so. Government Purpose Rights continue for a five-year period upon execution of the
contract, and upon expiration of the five-year period, the Government obtains Unlimited Rights in
the data.
Open Source. If Offerors propose the use of any open-source data or freeware, any conditions,
restrictions or other requirements imposed by that software shall also be addressed. Offerors
should leverage the format in Appendix A for their response.
Identification of Relevant Government Contracts. For all technical data and computer software that
an Offeror intends to deliver with other than unlimited rights that are identical or substantially 
Page 31 of 64
similar to technical data and computer software that the Offeror has produced for, delivered to, or
is obligated to deliver to the Government under any contract or subcontract, the Offeror shall
identify (a) the contract number under which the data, software, or documentation was produced;
(b) the contract number under which, and the name and address of the organization to whom, the
data and software was most recently delivered or shall be delivered; and (c) any limitations on the
Government’s rights to use or disclose the data and software, including, when applicable,
identification of the earliest date the limitations expire.
Definitions. For this solicitation, IARPA recognizes only the definitions of IP rights in accordance
with the terms as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 27 or as defined
herein. If Offerors propose IP rights that are not defined in FAR part 27 or herein, Offerors shall
clearly define such rights in the “Intellectual Property Rights” Attachment of their proposal.
Offerors are reminded of the requirement for prime contractors to acquire sufficient rights from
subcontractors to accomplish the program goals.
Evaluation. The Government will use the asserted data rights during the evaluation process to
evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions. The technical content of the “Intellectual
Property Rights” Attachment shall include only the information necessary to address the proposed
approach to IP; any other technical discussion in the attachment shall not be considered during the
evaluation process.
Attachment 3: OCI Notification or Certification Template provided in Appendix A.
Attachment 4: Bibliography. A brief bibliography of relevant technical papers and research notes
(published and unpublished) which document the technical ideas on which the proposal is based.
Attachment 5: Relevant Papers. Copies of not more than three relevant papers may be included in the
submission. The Offerors shall include a one-page technical summary of each paper provided, suitable
for individuals who are not experts in the field.
Attachment 6: Consultant Commitment Letters. If needed.
Attachment 7: Human Use Documentation; see 6.B.3.
Attachment 8: Animal Use Documentation. Not Applicable
Attachment 9: A Three Chart Summary of the Proposal. A PowerPoint summary that quickly and
succinctly indicates the concept overview, key innovations, expected impact, and other unique aspects of
the proposal. The format for the summary slides is included in Appendix A to this BAA and does not count
against the page limit. Slide 1 should be a self-contained, intuitive description of the technical approach
and performance. These slides may be used during the evaluation process to present a summary of the
proposal from the Offeror’s view.
Attachment 10: Security Plan. (Not to exceed 5 pages; Only applicable to those proposing to the classified
TA2 and TA3 portions of this effort). Offerors shall submit a Security Plan as part of their proposal
specifically stating how it will meet the security requirements of the anticipated contract. The Security Plan
shall explain the offeror’s overall approach to complying with, implementing, and maintaining security
policies, procedures, and directives, to include security practices and internal auditing programs. Security
organization and management should be explained by outlining the security management organizational
structure. Information Systems, Physical Security, Personnel Security, and Security Education and
Training should all be addressed. The plan should also address any approvals needed from other USG
organizations for using secure spaces to carry out the proposed work and the vendor’s plans for obtaining
those approvals. The plan should document all assumptions regarding GFE, GFI, USG-sponsored access
to or accreditation of IT systems, as well as contingency plans if such resources are not available or
delayed. The incorporation of operational security (OPSEC) practices and procedures are encouraged
throughout the plan to further mitigate security risks. Offerors shall follow the SoURCE CODE SCG for
all classification measures.

4.B.2. Volume 2: Cost Proposal (No Page Limit)
NOTE: This Volume is only required if the Offeror’s proposal has been selected for negotiation
(see BAA Section 5.B and 5.C). The notification of selection for negotiation will be issued in writing
by the CO and will include a request to submit the full Cost Volume within 10 business days or as
otherwise authorized by the contracting officer.
IARPA anticipates awarding cost-type procurement contracts however, Offerors requesting other than a
cost-type procurement contract (i.e., Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract or other transaction) may be directed
by the CO to provide “other than certified cost or pricing data” (reference FAR Part 15.4) and/or cost
supporting information in a different format than described below. The CO will determine whether to grant
the request for other than a cost-type procurement contract. Examples of requests that would be considered
for approval include those from non-traditional contractors such as commercial entities that do not accept
FAR- based cost contracts, small businesses, start-up companies, consortia that may include universities
and non-profits or foreign companies; where cost-sharing or government participation in the work is
appropriate; where flexibility not available under a procurement contract is needed; or where
commercialization by industry is deemed advantageous to the Government.
Regardless of the type of instrument determined to be appropriate by the CO, the Offeror’s cost proposal
shall contain sufficient factual information to establish the Offeror’s understanding of the project, the
perception of project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to support the realism and
reasonableness of the proposed cost, to the extent appropriate. IARPA recognizes that undue emphasis on
cost may motivate Offerors to offer low-risk ideas with minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with
junior personnel in order to be in a more competitive posture. IARPA discourages such cost strategies.
Cost reduction approaches that shall be received favorably include innovative management concepts that
maximize direct funding for technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.
4. B.2.a Section 1: Cover Sheet.
See Appendix B for the Cover Sheet Template
4. B.2.b. Section 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown.
Offerors shall submit numerical cost and pricing data using Microsoft Excel. The Excel document, in the
format provided in Appendix B, shall include intact formulas and shall not be hard numbered. The base
and option period cost data should roll up into a total cost summary. The Excel files may be writeprotected but shall not be password protected. The Cost/Price Volume shall include the following:
A. Completed Cost/Price Template - Offerors shall submit a cost element breakdown for the base
period, each option period and the total program summary in the format provided in Appendix B.
B. Total cost broken down by major task.
C. Major program tasks by fiscal year.
D. A summary of projected funding requirements by month.
E. A summary table listing all labor categories used in the proposal and their associated direct
labor rates, along with escalation factors used for each base year and option year.
F. A summary table listing all indirect rates used in the proposal for each base year and option
year.
Page 33 of 64
4. B.2.c. Section 3: Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient detail to
substantiate the Offeror’s cost estimates. Include a description of the basis of estimate (BOE) in a
narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable:
Direct Labor – Provide a complete cost breakout by labor category, hours and rates (template
available in Appendix B). Specify all Key Personnel by name and clearly state their labor category
and proposed rate. Describe the basis of the proposed rates and provide a copy of the most recent
Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) and/or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR) with
the Government. If Offerors do not have a current FPRA with the Government, provide payroll
records or contingency hire letters with salary data to support each proposed labor category, including
those for key individuals, and the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal Submission, if
applicable. Offeror should also address whether any portion of their labor rates is attributable to
uncompensated overtime.
Labor Escalation Factor – State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g., based
upon Global Insight indices, Cost Index or historical data). If the escalation rate is based upon
historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample calculation
demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor.
Subcontracts (to include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs) – The Offeror is
responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume.
Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, each option period and the
total summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Appendix B). If available,
provide a copy of the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) and/or Forward Pricing
Rate Recommendation (FPRR) with the Government. Consultant letter(s) of commitment shall also be
attached.
Information shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided in Appendix B
and addressing the supporting cost information as outlined in Section 4 of the BAA. In addition to the
full and complete subcontractor cost proposals, the Offeror shall also provide its analysis of each
subcontractor’s proposal including justification for why the subcontractor was selected and its
determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable (Reference FAR Part 44 and FAR clause
52.244-2). If subcontractors have concerns about proprietary cost information, subcontractors
can submit their detailed cost proposals directly to the CO.
Materials and Equipment – Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data or any other
information including Offeror’s analysis to support proposed costs.
Travel – The proposed travel supporting detail shall include destination and purpose of the trip,
number of trips, number of travelers and days per trip and price per traveler in sufficient detail to
verify the BOE. Proposed travel costs shall comply with the limitations set forth in FAR Part 31. (See
Appendix B.4 for sample format).
Proposed conference travel must have an immediate, direct, and tangible benefit to the Government
such as providing a deliverable at the conference (e.g., gives a presentation, presents a paper or
research findings that are sponsored in whole or in part by IARPA). Travel for personnel to simply
attend a conference will not be approved as a direct charge to the contract.
Other Direct Costs (ODCs) – ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes, historical data
or any other information including the Offeror’s analysis.
Indirect Costs – The Offeror shall show indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect rate
by contractor fiscal year and program period (base, option period) and provide information on indirect
cost pools and allocation bases for each year and program period involved. If a Government agency
recently audited the Offeror’s indirect rates, the Offeror shall identify the agency that conducted the 
Page 34 of 64
audit, when the rates were approved and the period for which they are effective. Include a copy of this
rate agreement. Absent current Government rate recommendations, it is incumbent on the Offeror to
provide some other means of demonstrating indirect rate realism (e.g., 3 years of historical actual
costs with applicable pools and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly from historical experience,
the Offeror shall explain of the variance.
Cost sharing – Describe the source, nature and amount of cost-sharing, if any. Reference Resource
Share from Section 4 of the BAA.
Other Pricing Assumptions – Identify all pricing assumptions that should be incorporated into the
resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished Property/Facilities/Information,
access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.). Reference Resource Share from Section 4 of
the BAA.
Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM) – If proposing FCCM, the Offeror shall show FCCM
cost calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and program year and
provide a copy of the Forward Price Rate Agreement (FPRA), Forward Price Rate System (FPRS) or
Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR), if available.
Profit/Fee – Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base. Provide
justification for your proposed profit or fee.
Systems – For the systems listed below, provide a brief description of the cognizant federal agency
and audit results. If the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short narrative describing
the steps your organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the current status. If a formal
audit has been performed by a Government Agency, please provide a complete copy of the audit
report or adequacy determination letter. If the system has never received a formal Government review
and approval include a statement to that effect. Address whether your organization has contracts that
are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered and if so, whether they are subject to full or modified
CAS coverage.
• Accounting system
• Purchasing system
Certified “cost or pricing data” may be requested for procurement contract awards that exceed the
threshold for submittal as set forth in the FAR, unless the CO approves an exception from the requirement
to submit cost or pricing data. (Reference FAR Part 15.403.)

SECTION 5: PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION
5.A. Technical and Funding Availability Evaluation Factors
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this Program BAA are described in the
following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be evaluated on its own
merits and its relevance to the Program goals rather than against other proposals submitted in
response to this BAA. The proposals shall be evaluated based on technical and funding availability factors.
These are of equal importance. Within the technical evaluation factor, the specific technical criteria are in
descending order of importance, as follows: Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, Effectiveness of
Proposed Work Plan, Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal, Relevant
Experience and Expertise, and Resource Realism. Specifics about the evaluation criteria are provided
below.
Award(s) shall be made to an Offeror based on the technical and funding availability factors listed
below, and subject to successful negotiations with the Government. Award shall not be made to
Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) are determined not to be selectable. Offerors are cautioned that failure to
follow submittal and proposal instructions may negatively impact their proposal evaluation or may result in
rejection of the proposal for non-compliance.
5.A.1. Technical Evaluation Factor (technical criteria listed below)
5. A.1.a. Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal is substantiated, including unique and innovative
methods, approaches, and/or concepts. The Offeror clearly articulates an understanding of the problem to
be solved. The technical approach is credible and includes a clear assessment of primary risks and a means
to address them. The proposed research advances the state-of-the-art.
5. A.1.b. Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan
The feasibility and likelihood that the proposed approach will satisfy the Program’s milestones and metrics
are explicitly described and clearly substantiated along with risk mitigation strategies for achieving stated
milestones and metrics. The proposal reflects a mature and quantitative understanding of the program
milestones and metrics, and the statistical confidence with which they may be measured. Any Offeror
proposed milestones and metrics are clear and well-defined, with a logical connection to enabling Offeror
decisions and/or Government decisions. The schedule to achieve the milestones is realistic and reasonable.
The roles and relationships of prime and sub-contractors are clearly delineated with all participants fully
documented. Work plans shall demonstrate the ability to provide full Government visibility into and
interaction with key technical activities and personnel, and a single point of responsibility for contract 
Page 36 of 64
performance. Work plans shall also demonstrate that all Key Personnel and significant contributors have
sufficient time committed to the Program to accomplish their described Program roles.
The requirement and rationale for and the anticipated use or integration of Government resources,
including but not limited to all equipment, facilities, information, etc., are fully described including dates
when such Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), GFI or
other similar Government-provided resources shall be required.
The Offeror’s RDMP is complete, addressing the types of data to be collected or produced, describing how
each type of data will be preserved and shared, including plans to provide public access to peer reviewed
publications and the underlying Research Data, or provides justifiable rationale for not doing so.
If applicable, the Security Plan is sound and delineates a comprehensive plan to protect all aspects of the
SoURCE CODE Program objectives and technology from disclosure. The offeror’s Security Plan for
implementing and maintaining a security posture ensures compliance with the National Industrial Security
Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) and applicable Intelligence Community Directives (ICDs).
The Privacy Plan reasonably addresses the requirements to protect personally identifiable information
(PII)and United States Persons (USP) information, and safeguard the security of any personal data.
5. A.1.c. Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal
The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated program goals and all elements within the
proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The Offeror clearly addresses how the
proposed effort shall meet and progressively demonstrate the Program goals. The Offeror describes how
the proposed solution contributes to IARPA’s mission to invest in high-risk/high-payoff research that can
provide the U.S. with an overwhelming intelligence advantage.
The Offeror’s proposed IP and data rights are consistent with the Government’s need to be able to
effectively manage the program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, communicate program
information across Government organizations and support transition to and further use and development of
the program results by IC users and others at a reasonable cost that is acceptable to the Government. The
proposed approach to IP rights is in the Government’s best interest.
5. A.1.d Relevant Experience and Expertise
The Offeror’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these,
which are integral factors for achieving the proposal's objectives, shall be evaluated, as well as
qualifications, capabilities, and experience of all Key Personnel and significant contributors critical in
achieving the program objectives.
5. A.1.e Resource Realism
The proposed resources demonstrate a clear understanding of the program, a perception of the risks and
the Offeror’s ability to organize and perform the work. The labor hours and mix are consistent with the
technical approach and are realistic for the work proposed. Material, equipment, software, data collection
and management, and travel, especially foreign travel, are well justified, reasonable, and required for
successful execution of the proposed work.
5.A.2. Funding Availability Factor
5. A.2.a. Budget Constraints
The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting program objectives within program
budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts. Note: If the Offeror has submitted
the proposal to other federal, state or local agencies or other parties that may fund the proposed effort, it
may impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort.
Page 37 of 64
5. A.2.b. Program Balance
The Government will consider IARPA’s overall mission and program objectives, which may include but
are not limited to the following: broadening the variety of technical approaches to enhance program
outcomes, transitioning the technology to Government partners, developing capabilities aligned with the
priorities of the IC and national security.
5.B. Method of Evaluation and Selection Process
IARPA conducts impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal reviews to select the source (or sources)
whose offer meets the Government's technical, policy and programmatic goals. For evaluation purposes, a
proposal is the document described in Section 4 of the BAA. Other supporting or background materials
submitted with the proposal shall not be considered.
The contract award process for this BAA has two steps. The first step is selection for negotiations and is
made based on the review of the technical and funding availability factors (See BAA Section 5.A.). The
second step is negotiation and contract award. Contract award is contingent on CO determination of a fair
and reasonable cost/price and agreement on terms and conditions.
Selection for negotiation will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process led by the PM.
This process entails establishing a Scientific Review Panel (SRP) made up of qualified Government
personnel who will review and assess each proposal’s strengths, weaknesses and risks3 against the
technical evaluation criteria. If necessary, non-Government technical experts with specialized expertise
may advise Government panel members and the PM. However, only Government personnel will make
selection recommendations and decisions under this BAA.
Proposals will be reviewed individually and will not be compared against each other as they are not
submitted in accordance with a common SOW. When SRP reviews are complete, the PM will prepare a
recommendation to the IARPA Scientific Review Official (SRO) identifying proposals as selectable,
selectable with modification, or not selectable based on consideration of all stated factors (technical and
funding availability factors). The SRO will make the final decision as to selectability for negotiations. At
this point, Offerors will be notified in writing as to whether they have been determined selectable,
selectable with modification, or not selectable.
5.C. Negotiation and Contract Award
After selection and before award, the CO will contact Offerors whose proposals were selected or selected
with modifications to engage in negotiations. At that time, the CO will also request a full cost proposal, as
described in BAA Section 4.B.2. The CO will review the cost proposal using the proposal analysis
techniques described in FAR 15.404-1, as appropriate, to determine a fair and reasonable cost. The CO’s
evaluation will include review of proposed anticipated costs/prices of the Proposer and those of associate,
participating organizations, to ensure the Offeror has fully analyzed the budget requirements, provided
sufficient supporting information, has adequate systems for managing the contract (accounting,
purchasing), and that data is traceable and reconcilable. The CO will also determine whether the
3 Strength: An aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has appreciable merit or appreciably exceeds specified
performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract
performance.
Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
Risk: The potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses the degree to which an
Offeror’s proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor may involve risk of disruption of
schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the
likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.
Page 38 of 64
prospective contractor meets the responsibility standards of FAR Section 9.104. Additional information
and supporting data may be requested.
If proposed costs submitted are substantially different than the estimates provided in the technical
proposal, then a contract may not be awarded.
Procurement contracts or other transactions, as determined by the contracting officer, shall be awarded to
those Offerors whose proposals are deemed most advantageous to the Government, all stated evaluation
factors considered, and pending the successful conclusion of negotiations.
5.D. Proposal Retention
Proposals shall not be returned upon completion of the source selection process. The original of each
proposal received shall be retained at IARPA and all other non-required copies shall be destroyed. A
certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal request is sent to IARPA via e-mail
to DNI-IARPA-BAA-24-02@iarpa.gov within 5 days after notification of proposal results.
5.E. Permission to Share with USG Partners
Given the scope of the SoURCE CODE BAA and the mission of IARPA to pursue fundamental and
applied research advances, some proposals that are not selected for award may be of interest to other USG
partners. Offerors interested in having their technical proposal (i.e., Volume I) shared with other USG
agencies are encouraged to include the following statement verbatim in their submission(s):
[INSERT ORG NAME] grants permission to IARPA to share this [PROPOSAL TECHNICAL
VOLUME] with other US Government agencies. Distribution is limited to US Government employees
and their SETA contractor support only. This permission does not infringe upon any current or future
claims of proprietary information or intellectual property by [INSERT ORG NAME].
SECTION 6: AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION
6.A. Award Notices
As soon as practicable after the evaluation of a proposal is complete, the Offeror will be notified that: (1)
its proposal has been selected for negotiations, or (2) its proposal has not been selected for negotiations.
6.B. Administrative and National Policy Requirements
6.B.1. Proprietary Data
IARPA treats all proposals as proprietary information and will disclose their contents only for the purpose
of evaluation. All proposals containing proprietary data shall have the cover page and each page
containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. It is the Offeror’s responsibility
to clearly define to the Government what the Offeror considers proprietary data.
6.B.2. Intellectual Property
General. The Government may request additional information from the Offeror, as may be necessary, to
evaluate the Offeror’s IP rights assertions. If Offerors do not identify any restrictions with respect to a
particular deliverable, the Government shall assume in its review of the proposal that there are no
restrictions on the Government’s use of such deliverables. Further, failure to provide full information may
result in a determination that the proposal is not compliant with the solicitation, and the Government
reserves the right to reject a proposal if the Offeror does not appropriately address all required IP rights
issues. 
Page 39 of 64
IP Ownership. Regardless of the scope of the Government’s rights, Offerors may freely use data for their
own commercial purposes (unless restricted by the negotiated contract, U.S. export control laws or
security classification). Therefore, data including technical data and computer software developed under
any contract resulting from this solicitation may remain the property of the Offerors, subject to IARPA’s
rights as set forth in the contract. IARPA seeks the rights to technical data and/or computer software
leveraged, developed, or used for the SoURCE CODE program in accordance with FAR 52.227-14. For
inventions first conceived or actually reduced to practice under for this effort, IARPA will obtain a
nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on its
behalf, such invention throughout the world; Offeror may elect to retain title as described in FAR 52.227-
11.
Indemnification. Offerors expecting to use, but not to deliver, data or patentable inventions, including
commercial open-source tools in implementing their approach shall be required to indemnify the
Government against legal liability arising from such use.
Technical Data – Withholding of Payment. If technical data specified to be delivered under a contract
awarded under this solicitation is not delivered within the time specified by the contract or is deficient
upon delivery (including having restrictive markings not specifically authorized by the contract), the CO
is permitted, until such data are accepted by the Government, to withhold payment to the contractor of ten
percent (10%) of the total contract price or amount unless a lesser withholding is specified in the contract.
Payments may not be withheld, nor any other action taken pursuant to this paragraph when the
contractor's failure to make timely delivery or to deliver such data without deficiencies arises out of
causes beyond its control and without fault or negligence of the contractor. The withholding of any
amount or subsequent payment to the contractor shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing
to the Government under the contract.
6.B.3. Human Use
All research involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human data,
selected for funding must comply with the federal regulations for human subject protection, namely 45
CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects.
Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a
current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a
Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide
Assurance (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp). All institutions engaged in human subject research, to include
subcontractors, must also have a valid Assurance. In addition to a local IRB approval, IARPA will review
and approve the HSR documentation before HSR may begin. However, IARPA does not require a
secondary review by a Government IRB.
For all proposed research that will involve human subjects, the institution must provide evidence of or a
plan for review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) with the final proposal submission to IARPA as
outlined in the management plan. (Reference Section 4 of the BAA). The IRB conducting the review must
be the IRB identified on the institution’s Assurance. The informed consent document must comply with
federal regulations (45 CFR Part 46).
Note: Due to the sensitive nature of this program, Offerors are NOT to submit any Human Subject
Research protocols to any external IRBs, even if the study’s activities would be considered entirely
unclassified, without prior IARPA approval.
The amount of time required to complete the IRB review/approval process may vary depending on the
complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants. Ample time should be allotted to
complete the approval process. No IARPA funding can be used towards human subject research until
ALL approvals are granted.
In limited instances, human subject research may be exempt from Federal regulations for human subject
protection, for example, under Department of Health and Human Services, 45 CFR 46.101(b). Offerors 
Page 40 of 64
claiming that their research falls within an exemption from Federal regulations for human subject
protection must provide written documentation with their proposal that cites the specific applicable
exemption and explains clearly how their proposed research fits within that exemption.
6.B.4. Animal Use
No research proposals involving animal subjects shall be accepted under this BAA.
6.B.5. Publication Approval
For proposals submitted encompassing the UNCLASSIFIED TA1 portion of this effort: It is
anticipated that some of the research funded under this Program shall be unclassified research that shall
not require a pre-publication review. However, Offerors should note that pre-publication approval
of certain information may be required if it is determined that its release may result in the disclosure of
sensitive intelligence information. A courtesy soft copy of any work submitted for publication shall be
provided to the IARPA PM and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) a minimum
of 5 business days prior to release in any forum.
For proposals submitted encompassing all areas of this program, to include the CLASSIFIED TA2
& TA3 portions of this effort: Pre-publication approval for classified research information associated
with IARPA is required for the SoURCE CODE Program. Approval must be obtained prior to submission
of any classified publications because of the security components of the program. Offerors are advised that
if they propose grants or cooperative agreements, IARPA may elect to award other award instruments,
particularly if a determination of sensitivity as described above is made. Any award resulting from such a
determination may include a requirement to obtain IARPA’s permission before publishing any information
on the research.
6.B.6. Export Control
(1) The Offeror shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 through 130, and the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 through 799, and any amendments thereto, in the
performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Offeror shall
be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of
(including deemed exports) hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical
assistance.
(2) The Offeror shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing non-U.S.
persons (as defined in the ITAR and EAR, as applicable) in the performance of this contract, including
instances where the work is to be performed on-site at any Government installation (whether in or outside
the United States), where the foreign person shall have access to export-controlled technologies,
including technical data or software.
(3) The Offeror shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the
use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.
(4) The Offeror shall appropriately mark all contract deliverables controlled by ITAR and/or EAR.
(5) The Offeror shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this section apply to its subcontractors.
(6) The Offeror may be required to certify knowledge of and intended adherence to these requirements
in the representations and certifications of the contract.
6.B.7. Subcontracting
Page 41 of 64
It is the policy of the Government to enable small business and small disadvantaged business concerns to
be considered fairly as sub-contractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime
contractors or sub-contractors under Government contracts and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Each Offeror that is selected for negotiation for award and is expected
to be awarded a contract which exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold may be asked to submit a
sub-contracting plan before award in accordance with FAR 19.702(a) (1). The plan format is outlined in
FAR 19.704.
Offerors shall declare teaming relationships in their Technical and Cost proposals and shall specify the
type of teaming arrangement in place, including any exclusive teaming arrangements. IARPA neither
promotes nor discourages the establishment of exclusive teaming agreements within Offeror teams.
Individuals or organizations associated with multiple teams shall take care not to over-commit those
resources being applied.
6.B.8. Reporting
Fiscal and management responsibility are important to the Program. Although the number and types of
reports shall be specified in the award document, all Offerors shall, at a minimum, provide the CO,
COTR and PM with monthly technical reports and monthly financial reports. The reports shall be
prepared and submitted in accordance with the procedures contained in the award document and mutually
agreed upon before award. Technical reports shall describe technical highlights and accomplishments,
priorities and plans, issues and concerns, evaluation results, and future plans. Financial reports shall
present an on-going financial profile of the project, including total project funding, funds invoiced, funds
received, funds expended during the preceding month, and planned expenditures over the remaining
period. Additional reports and briefing material may also be required, as appropriate, to document
progress in accomplishing program metrics.
The Offeror shall prepare and provide a research report of their work by month 18 for Phases 1 and by
month 30 for Phase 2. The reports shall be delivered to the CO, COTR, and the PM. The reports shall
include:
• Problem definition
• Findings and approach
• System design
• Possible generalization(s)
• Information on performance limitations and potential mitigation
• Anticipated path ahead
• Final identification of all commercial, third-party, or proprietary hardware, software, or technical
data integrated into any deliverable and all applicable use restrictions.
• Any research products, including publications, data, and software, resulting from the project during
the reporting period. The final report shall list in-progress scientific manuscripts and other research
products.
6.B.9. System for Award Management (SAM)
Selected Offerors will be required to register in the SAM system prior to any award under this BAA
unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Information on SAM registration is available at
http://www.sam.gov.
6.B.10. Representations and Certifications
Page 42 of 64
Selected Offerors will be required to complete electronic representations and certifications at
http://www.sam.gov and may also be required to complete additional representations and certifications
prior to award, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer.
6.B.11. Lawful Use and Privacy Protection Measures
All data gathered by the Offeror shall be obtained in accordance with U.S. laws and in compliance with
the End User License Agreement, Copyright Laws, Terms of Service, and laws and policies regarding
privacy protection of U.S. Persons. Before using such data, the Offeror shall provide proof that the data
was acquired in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations.
6.B.12. Public Access to Results
For proposals submitted encompassing the UNCLASSIFIED TA1 portion of this effort: IARPA is
committed to making the results of this research available and maximally useful to the public, industry,
government, and the scientific community, in accordance with the policy set forth in the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy’s memorandum “Increasing Access to the Results of Federally
Funded Scientific Research,” dated February 22, 2013, consistent with all other applicable law and
policy; agency mission; resource constraints; and U.S. national, homeland, and economic security.

IA52.204-710 Security Requirements – Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
Clearances (JUN 2017)
(a) IARPA requires security screening of contractor personnel who support its classified
contracts or need access to ODNI facilities. “Contractor personnel” means an employee of
the contractor company at the time the contractor requests a security clearance. In order to
access a classified IARPA Program or ODNI facility, the contractor employee must be a U.S.
citizen, and must be eligible to obtain a security clearance. In order to receive a security
clearance, contractor personnel shall be US citizens and provide the following information for
use in the clearance process:
(1) "Industrial Security Approval or Access Request", Form 4311
(2) "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," SF 86; and
(3) Fair Credit Reporting Act Release form.
The contractor shall plan for expected attrition by advance preparation and submission of the
aforementioned items.
(b) Those contractor personnel needing unescorted access to Government facilities (to include
Government automated information systems) and access to sensitive compartmented
information (SCI) or information classified at the Top-Secret level shall be required to have
an Industrial Top Secret (TS) security clearance along with any required SCI access
approvals. The granting or denial of a TS or SCI access approval is based on a comparison of
the results of a full field background investigation and full scope polygraph testing against the
adjudicative guidelines issued pursuant to Executive Order 12968 or other applicable law or
regulation. The adjudicative guidelines have also been adopted as an annex to Intelligence
Community Directive (ICD) 704. Full scope polygraph examinations cover both
counterintelligence (CI) and security issues to include involvement in illegal drug use and
criminal activity. Full scope polygraph examinations are an integral part of TS security
screening.
(c) Those contractor personnel needing access to Top Secret or SCI material shall be required to
obtain a Top-Secret Collateral security clearance, along with any required SCI access
approval. The granting or denial of a Top-Secret Collateral Clearance, or SCI access
approval, is based on a comparison of the results of a full field background investigation, and,
if appropriate, a counterintelligence (CI) scope polygraph test, against the adjudicative
guidelines issued pursuant to Executive Order 12968, as amended, and applicable ODNI
policy.
(d) Those contractor personnel needing access to Secret material shall be required to have a
Secret Collateral security clearance. The granting or denial of a Secret Collateral security
clearance is based on a comparison of the results of a more limited inquiry (generally
National Agency Checks [NAC], Local Agency Checks [LAC], and credit checks) against the
adjudicative guidelines issued pursuant to Executive Order 12968, as amended, and
applicable ODNI policy.
Page 48 of 64
(e) Those contractor personnel needing unescorted access to Government facilities and who may,
as a result, receive inadvertent access to classified material shall be required to have a Facility
Access Approval (FAA). The granting or denial of an FAA is based on a comparison of the
results of a background investigation and full scope polygraph testing against the adjudicative
guidelines issued pursuant to Executive Order 12968, as amended, and applicable ODNI
policy.
(f) Executive Order 12968, as amended by Executive Order 13467, provides that individuals
who are eligible for, or who currently have access to classified information, shall be subject
to Continuous Evaluation (CE), as defined by standards determined by the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Through Security Executive Agency Directive 6
(SEAD 6) ODNI established the relevant standards for CE. Absent extenuating
circumstances, contractors are responsible for signing and returning any required CE forms to
their Sponsor-cleared personnel no later than ten (10) business days after the Sponsor’s
request. Security clearance reinvestigation paperwork, to include Standard Form 86 and
other forms, shall only be submitted when specifically requested by the Sponsor.
(g) If portions of the work under this contract occur at ODNI facilities contractor personnel shall
adhere to all IARPA regulations and procedures that relate to security management. In the
event that the development of information or material is not clearly covered by the contract or
regulations, the contractor is required to seek Government guidance regarding its
handling. Any questions that the contractor or contractor personnel may have on the
applicability of these requirements shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer's Security
Representative.
(h) Only such persons who have been authorized by the Contracting Officer or the Contracting
Officer's Technical Representative shall be assigned to this work. In order to track
individuals to specific contract activities, the contractor is required to maintain the following
information:
(1) By contract number - individuals who have worked, are currently working, or are in
security processing for each contract; and
(2) By individual - identify each classified contract the individual has supported.
Upon Government request, this information is to be made available to the Contracting Officer,
Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative or Chief, IARPA Security.
(i) All contractor personnel who receive a security clearance or access approval under the terms
of this contract will be required to execute an appropriate Government secrecy agreement
and/or nondisclosure agreement.
The Contractor agrees to abide by all applicable Government security regulations governing personnel,
facilities, technical, information systems, communications, and protective programs, as outlined in the
NISPOM and associated ICDs and DCIDs.
