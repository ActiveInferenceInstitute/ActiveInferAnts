SECTION 1: FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION
IARPA often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.
The use of a BAA solicitation allows a wide range of innovative ideas and concepts. The BAA
will appear under Contract Opportunities on https://sam.gov and a link will be placed on the
IARPA website at https://iarpa.gov.
This BAA is issued in accordance with (IAW) the FAR section 6.102(d)(2), which provides for the
competitive selection of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the
development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Proposals submitted in response to
this BAA that are selected for award are to be in full compliance with Provisions of Public Law
98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act” of 1984 and subsequent amendments. The
following information is provided for those wishing to respond to this Program BAA.
1.A. Program Overview
Microphones in modern electronics are ubiquitous and constantly listening for speech signals –
using voice driven technologies to interact with people – making it likely that our speech is
recorded nearly everywhere. Speech is often transmitted to the cloud for processing, analysis, and
storage, where analytics could reveal patterns of life. Once speech has been collected, existing
technologies, such as Speaker Identification (SID) and forensic speech analysis (FSA), pose
significant threats to speaker privacy. The goal of the Anonymous Real-Time Speech (ARTS)
program is to develop novel systems that will modify spontaneous speech in real-time to protect
an individual’s privacy.
Speaker identification determines an unknown individual’s identity based on samples of their
speech. SID tools rely on models derived from speech segments taken from known individuals.
With many individuals enrolled in a SID system, speaker identification is a 1:N comparison, where
an utterance is compared against multiple templates in order to answer the question, “Who is
speaking.” The ARTS program is seeking novel methods for near real-time Speaker DeIdentification (SDID) capabilities to prevent SID systems from attributing the recordings to
the actual speaker, even with the individual enrolled in the SID database.
An individual’s speech also has characteristics that do not change often. Some of these features
can reveal aspects about the speaker, such as dialect, gender, and age. Although such properties
can change over time – for instance, some people will gradually affect a new dialect after living
abroad for many years – in general, these speech characteristics remain static for many individuals.
The ARTS program is looking for novel methods to modify speech so that three existing
static traits of dialect, gender, and age, will be removed and replaced with a profile of preselected traits.
There are also methods to analyze speech signals that can assess a temporary state of a speaker,
like a short-term emotional or physical state. For example, statistical features extracted from
speech segments can be used to predict if a person is angry, sick, or intoxicated. Many of these
approaches leverage artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) techniques to discriminate
between different classes of temporary states. The ARTS program is looking for approaches to
defeat statistical classification of these short-term states.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 9 of 85
With these different threats to privacy, the ARTS program is looking for innovations to anonymize
speech in near real-time by addressing three Technical Areas (TA).
• Technical Area 1 (TA1) – Speaker De-Identification (SDID): Modify speech signals so
that SID systems are unable to recognize the speaker.
• Technical Area 2 (TA2) – Modification of static traits in speech: Remove existing traits
in speech signals related to dialect, gender, and age, and replace them with pre-selected
traits.
• Technical Area 3 (TA3) – Removal of dynamic traits in speech: Modify speech signals
so that extracted features can’t be used to differentiate short term states such as emotion and
psychological state.
There have been recent advances in speech synthesis that produce promising results in areas
adjacent to the goals of ARTS. These capabilities rely on new technologies that could likely play
a role in ARTS systems. However, to satisfy the privacy goals of the ARTS program, successful
innovations should also be useful; they shall work in real-time and the quality of the speech shall
not noticeably degrade. Thus, solutions will be constrained by three utility requirements: latency,
understandability, and naturalness.
With three TAs and three utility constraints, the ARTS program is driving to find methods to
anonymize speech that will address six different and competing dimensions simultaneously.
Figure 1 highlights the six different dimensions of the problem.
Figure 1 The ARTS program will simultaneously address six dimensions:
three TAs for anonymity and competing forces of three areas of utility.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 10 of 85
Performers shall conduct research against all three technical areas, producing robust software
systems that can operate on standalone computers. Performer systems will be required to develop
modules for each TA operating individually and a single solution that includes all three TA
modules operating together to meet program goals. With the distinct and competitive objectives of
the program, potential Performer teams are encouraged to pursue collaborative efforts and teaming
opportunities. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary and may include expertise in
one or more of the disciplines listed in Section 1.B, Team Expertise.
Speech data will be provided by the Government for use in the ARTS program. This data may be
modified by performers to enhance their capabilities. Use of external data is permitted with
Government approval. Speech data will initially focus on the English language, although other
widely spoken languages such as Spanish will be used later in the program. Additional details on
Program data can be found in Section 1.C, Program Data.
The ARTS Test and Evaluation (T&E) teams will compile robust sets of diverse and relevant
speech corpora to support research goals. In addition to speech collected from conversations of
actual speakers, synthetic data may potentially be created to assist training. The T&E teams will
be conducting several field data collections, studio data collections and data simulation exercises
throughout the life of the program. While a portion of data will be made available to Performers
for R&D, T&E will withhold sets of data to facilitate the testing and validating of performance
through a series of challenges. However, for each speaker in the evaluation data set, the
Government will provide sample segments to allow performers to produce speaker embeddings.
The independent test and evaluation performed by the T&E teams on Performer software
deliverables will inform Government stakeholders on ARTS research progress but will also serve
as valuable feedback to the Performers to improve their research approaches, algorithm training
practices, and system development. The ARTS program will work closely with Government
leaders in speech processing and speaker ID to continually refine and improve T&E
methodologies. Additional information on T&E is described in Section 1.D, Test and Evaluation.
Developed capabilities must be containerized and compatible with a government furnished
Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate assessment by independent T&E according
to program metrics described in Section 1.E, Program Metrics. In particular, source code for
these capabilities must be developed and deliver in a manner such that T&E can install, build and
execute the software, including the ability to retrain speech models. Any external libraries or other
dependencies must be included in deliverables.
Performer systems will be evaluated on an interim basis to track progress and ensure compliance
with system requirements. Over the course of the ARTS program, the evaluation challenges will
become progressively more difficult. The ARTS program will adhere to a fixed training condition,
where Performers can use a consistent set of training data provided by the Government. Performers
will need to continually improve their systems aggressively to meet these challenges.
The ARTS program is envisioned as a 36-month effort, comprised of two (2) Phases, each lasting
18 months. Proposals shall include a solution for Phases 1 and 2, inclusive of all Technical Areas.
Proposals that do not include a solution for both phases or do not address all Technical Areas will
be considered non-compliant and will not be evaluated or considered for award. A schedule of
program waypoints, milestones, and deliverables is provided in Section 1.F.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 11 of 85
1.A.1 Technical Areas
Proposed solutions for the ARTS program shall be a single complete system that includes three
software-based modules, one for each TA. The complete system should be configured so the
modules can be executed alone, as well as in combination with other modules at the same time.
When the system is configured to execute a single module by itself, only the goals of that TA are
required to be addressed. However, when the entire system is configured to execute two or three
modules at the same time, the system must address the goals of the TAs for each module selected.
When the system is operating in any mode, it must address all three utility requirements.
The Government will furnish data to be used by Performers, but the Government also recognizes
the benefits of additional speech data that teams may already have. Consequently, Performers may
incorporate the use of other existing data sources, provided these sets can be made available to the
Government for evaluation purposes. All software solutions must adhere to a framework or API
developed by T&E Teams, which will be provided to Performers at kickoff. The solutions must
run on a stand-alone computer, called the ARTS Processing System (APS), with specifications
(operating system, hardware configurations) to be provided at program kickoff. Figure 2 provides
an illustration of this concept.
Figure 2 Given the data, API, and specifications of the APS, performers will
develop a system that addresses the three TAs and all utility requirements.
T&E will process speech on the APS using sequestered data, transforming speech from an
individual, Alice, into speech that sounds like it comes from a new, different person, Pseudo Alice.
Pseudo Alice shall not sound like a specific target individual. However, T&E must be able to
recreate results for transformed speech from original speaker; Pseudo Alice shall always sound
like Pseudo Alice. See Figure 3. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 12 of 85
Figure 3 The ARTS system shall transform speech from an individual into
speech that sounds like it comes from a new, different person.
Figure 4 provides an illustration of a compliant ARTS system that addresses the three TAs, along
with three utility requirements. Performer teams will be provided speech corpora, target profiles,
a description of an SID approach, and system requirements for the hardware on which solutions
will be executed.
Figure 4 Illustration of an ARTS system that has components to address each
TA, while adhering to three utility constraints.
The following subsections describe each TA in more detail, along with the innovations sought by
the ARTS program.
1.A.1.1 Technical Area 1: Speaker De-Identification
The goal of TA1 is to develop novel methods to modify speech so that it will not be attributed to
the original speaker or any other individual. The ARTS program is looking for innovations that
include novel low-level representations of speech, fast speech synthesis models, and text-free
speech synthesis.
Solutions for TA1 shall have the following properties:
• The TA1 module shall take an input segment of speech from an original speaker, Alice, and
output a new speech signal segment, called pseudo-Alice. The output speech segment should
have the same linguistic content (lexical phrases) with the exception of speech disfluencies
such as discourse markers, restarts, stutters, and other sounds that do not convey content.
Linguistic content is defined as the meaning conveyed through vocabulary, syntax,
morphology, and semantics, and speech disfluencies are disruptions that occur in the flow of
talking.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 13 of 85
• If T&E is performing an SID evaluation on a segment from pseudo-Alice using a system that
has been trained on a set of original speakers, the segment shall not be attributed to any
speakers enrolled in the SID system. This includes the scenario where the original speaker,
Alice, is enrolled in the database.
• The TA1 module shall have the ability to transform an input segment in different ways, so
that it is possible to obtain different output speech from the same speaker. The outputs should
differ so that SID would indicate they were spoken by different individuals. The minimum
number of different pseudo-speakers that can be obtained by a single original speaker is eight
(8).
• The TA1 module shall produce consistent transformation(s). That is, if desired by the user,
the modification of any speech segment from Alice can always appear to come from the same
(non-existent) individual, pseudo-Alice.
• For speech from a different original speaker, Bob, which is transformed by the same module,
the output should be different from any other pseudo-speaker.
In plain language, the SDID module should change a speaker’s voice in many ways, so that a user
can choose to have pseudo-speech consistent with a specific, non-existent person. Also, no two
different pseudo-speakers should sound like the same person.
The SID threat model assumed under the ARTS program is one of an informed attacker. This
means that as part of the evaluation of TA1, T&E Teams performing SID attacks on processed
speech will have full knowledge of the de-identification algorithms. The T&E Teams will use these
algorithms to help build models of speech modified by the Performers’ systems. The intent of this
threat model is to have the strength of the de-identification method rely on the algorithm instead
of hiding the fact that this processing is potentially taking place.
SID tests consist of trials, in which an utterance (test segment) is compared against enrollment
data (target segments) in the SID system. The SID system processes trials independently to
produce output log-likelihood ratio (LLR) scores. The test conditions for TA1 are as follows:
• The speech duration of the test segments will be uniformly sampled ranging approximately
from 10 seconds to 60 seconds.
• Trials will be conducted under the scenario where unprocessed, original speakers are used
for enrollment segment(s), to assess how output segments are attributed to real speakers.
• Trials will be conducted under the scenario where transformed, pseudo-speakers are used for
enrollment segment(s), to assess whether the solutions can produce output that sounds like it
comes from different speakers.
• Trials will be conducted under the scenario where consistent pseudo-speakers are used for
enrollment segment(s), to assess whether the solutions can consistently change a speaker to
always sound like the same (non-existent) person.
• Trails will include cross-gender comparisons.

1.A.1.2 Technical Area 2: Static Trait Replacement
The goal of TA2 is to research and develop speech processing methods that remove existing traits
in speech signals related to dialect, gender, and age, and replace them with pre-selected traits. The
ARTS program is looking for innovations in speech processing that may include phonetic
(segmental and suprasegmental) and non-phonetic (linguistic, non-linguistic, and lexical choices)
aspects.
For TA2, an individual speaker will have a known profile consisting of three long-term states:
dialect, gender, and cohort (age groups). Languages and dialects will differ in Phase1 and Phase
2. The ARTS program will limit dialects to a small set of well-studied groups, acknowledging that
regional dialects and accents are far too numerous to include in the scope of this program. One
common type of dialect will be called accented, in which the speaker is fluent in two languages.
For the purpose of this program, an accented language will be from a speaker who is fluent in that
language as a second language; the speaker’s first language, L1, is different. For instance, a person
with an accented Spanish could be someone who has a first language of English and second
language Spanish (L1 English/L2 Spanish).
Gender and age will be self-reported by the individual speakers. Cohorts will consist of three sets
of non-adjacent ranges: Young (18-24), Adult (35-44), and Senior (55-64).
Solutions for TA2 shall have the following properties:
• The TA2 module shall take an input segment of speech from an original speaker, Alice, who
has a specific profile (Dialect, Gender, Cohort), along with a randomly chosen profile, and
produce new speech with the same linguistic content (excluding speech disfluencies) in a
manner so that a panel of human evaluators would believe the speaker has the randomly
chosen profile.
• The profile of the TA2 output speech shall match the randomly selected profile regardless of
whether the original speaker has a static trait that already matches a target trait. That is, if an
original speaker speaks with an SAE dialect, and the SAE dialect is randomly chosen as part
of the output profile, the TA2 module should produce speech that has an SAE dialect.
• Solutions that add or remove non-linguistic content that may be inherent to a specific static
trait are permitted. For instance, certain discourse markers, slang words, and other utterances
or non-vocal sounds that are present/absent may be modified, removed, or added to assist
with the transformation of the profile. In addition to these approaches, the ARTS program
seeks additional novel methods to modify static traits.
Results from the TA2 module will be assessed by a panel of human evaluators. Evaluators will be
asked to assess traits for original speakers in order to obtain a baseline of the panel’s ability to
differentiate between dialects, ages, and genders.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 15 of 85
1.A.1.3 Technical Area 3: Dynamic Trait Removal
The goal of TA3 is to modify speech signals so that extracted features can’t be used to differentiate
short term states such as emotion and psychological state. A common method to assess these
dynamic traits is to extract high-dimensional features and use deep neural networks to classify the
speech. These features can vary but are usually found implemented in speech analysis software
packages like Praat and the open-source Speech and Music Interpretation by Large-space
Extraction (openSMILE) toolkit. Innovations to address this area may include (but are not limited
to) source modeling of emotional speech, generative adversarial networks, and universal
adversarial perturbations.
The ARTS program will categorize emotions into two sets: positive traits, which consist of happy
and excited, and negative traits, which include angry and sad. Under this construction, the goal of
TA3 is to defeat binary classifiers which are designed to differentiate between these classes.
Solutions for TA3 shall have the following properties:
• The TA3 module shall take an input segment of speech from an original speaker, Alice,
and produce new speech with the same linguistic content (excluding speech disfluencies)
in a manner so that positive and negative traits present in the speech are removed.
T&E will assess the output from the TA3 module by evaluating a set of low-level descriptor (LLD)
features extracted from modified speech signals. These LLD features will be evaluated by three
different deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) previously trained on unprocessed emotional
data sets.
1.A.2 Utility Constraints
In addition to the three modules described above, a complete solution must also perform under
three utility constraints: latency, understandability, and naturalness. Systems are required to
operate under each of these constraints for each single TA module and the final solution containing
all three TA modules.
1.A.2.1 Utility Constraint 1: Latency
Latency is a key component to the ARTS program, and goals will be for delays on the order of
common communication channels such as satellite phones or voice over IP (VoIP). Latency is
perceived as the time difference between when a specific word is spoken as input and when the
output of that word is produced. The ARTS program allows for the synthesis of sounds that might
not be present in original speech. Spontaneous speech often contains linguistic, non-linguistic, and
lexical choices that don’t change the meaning of what is being said. This includes fillers (“uh”,
“um”, “like”, “you know”, “I mean”), restarts (repetitions, corrections, restarts), pauses (silent,
breathed, filled), and keywords/slang. Much like the human brain uses these disfluencies to buy
time as we formulate our thoughts and words, ARTS systems may introduce, remove or modify to
help reduce the impact of processing time. An example is shown in Figure 5, where the synthesis
of the word “um”, along with a breathed pause, allows for more processing time, since latency is
determined by when the utterance “um” is produced.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 16 of 85
Figure 5 The utility constraint for latency is determined by the detection of the
first utterance, rather than the difference in time between exact words.
With the understanding that the output speech might not be a word-for-word replication, latency
will be measured as the duration between speech input and speech activity detection (SAD) on the
output. Latency will be measured by T&E Teams on the APS.
1.A.2.2 Utility Constraint 2: Understandability
Many approaches to anonymizing speech will reduce the understandability. T&E will evaluate
output speech to ensure that the understandability of transformed speech is within reason. Since
program data will include annotated transcripts, this constraint will be measured by automatic
speech recognition (ASR) system such as Kaldi Speech-to-Text. With the ASR evaluation system,
discourse markers will be ignored, and the adjusted word error rate (WER) will be measured by
comparing ground truth transcripts with ASR output and computing the number of wrong words
(substitutions), missing words (deletions), and addition of words (insertions). Modified lexical
choices that are synonymous will also be ignored for WER. Because ASR systems are not perfect
and quality of data sets can vary, T&E Teams will compute the baseline WER on original,
unprocessed data.
1.A.2.3 Utility Constraint 3: Naturalness
The ARTS program aims to produce solutions that can transform speech and continue to sound
natural. Listeners often find many speech synthesis tools create speech that sounds artificial, and
especially with SDID systems, the output can sound robotic. T&E will assess naturalness with a
panel of ~200 unique listeners, balanced in gender, with individuals assessing a small set of output
speech. This approach has been successfully used in events such as the Voice Privacy Challenge.
For this evaluation, listeners will be informed that they will hear test segments that may be of high
quality, but some may sound artificial due to deterioration caused by computer processing.
Participants will then evaluate segments on a five-point scale (Bad, Poor, Fair, Good, and
Excellent). The mean opinion score (MOS) will be computed for both original, unprocessed data,
as well as output from the solution systems.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 17 of 85
1.A.3 Program Phases
All three Technical Areas and all three utility constraints must be addressed by performers in both
Phase 1 and Phase 2. The key difference between the two phases will be the languages involved.
Phase 1 will concentrate on speech segments in English. Phase 2 will initially focus on variants of
Spanish, before including other languages that are spoken by a large portion of the global
population.
1.A.3.1 Phase 1: English
The goal of Phase 1 is to develop anonymization systems for speech in the English language.
Dialects will include Standard American English (SAE), Standard Southern British English
(SSBE), and accented English where the speaker’s L1 is Spanish and L2 is English.
Phase 1 shall have a duration of 18 months, with interim deliveries of interim containerized
software solutions, including source code, at months 5 and 11, and final deliverables at month 16.
Interim deliverables will be evaluated against subsets of the Technical Areas to measure progress
and provide performers feedback, and Final Phase 1 deliverables will be evaluated against all three
Technical Areas. The Final Phase 1 complete system will also undergo ablation testing for the
purpose of deeper understanding of the outputs and interactions between different TAs within the
complete system.
Table 1 provides a list of software deliverables for Phase 1, along with the challenge areas that
must be addressed and language/dialect information.

constraints SAE, SSBE, L1 Spanish/L2 English
1.A.3.2 Phase 2: Non-English
The goal of Phase 2 is to develop anonymization systems for speech in non-English languages.
The first 12 months of Phase 2 will focus on the Spanish language and will likely include the very
distinct and well-studied dialects such as North Central Peninsular Spanish (NCPS), Eastern
Andalusian Spanish (EAS), and accented Spanish where the speaker’s L1 is English and L2 is
Spanish. Stretch goals for the end of Phase 2 will include a variety of other languages that are
commonly spoken throughout the world. These languages include Korean, Russian, Modern
Standard Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese (MC), where data for each language will consist of native
speakers and L1/L2 speakers of that language. For example, with Korean the data will include
native speakers of Korean and speakers with L1 English/L2 Korean. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 18 of 85
Phase 2 shall have a duration of 18 months. Phase 2 consists of advanced algorithm development
to address moderate to high challenges. Throughout the phase, quarterly deliveries of containerized
software and source code are anticipated and will be tested and evaluated through challenge
activities. The Final Phase 2 complete system will also undergo ablation testing for the purpose
of deeper understanding of the outputs and interactions between different TAs within the complete
system.

IARPA will continue to use ARTS API developed by the ARTS T&E Team in Phases 1 and 2 for
all Technical Areas. The T&E teams will provide datasets for the purpose of constructing the
evaluation challenges. Following each challenge, performance analysis results and challenge data
will be provided to performers for review and methodology improvement. The sharing of this data
with Performers after the challenges is to facilitate communication and internal Performer error
analyses. More details on the datasets are available in Section 1.C, Program Data and more
details on the API are available in Section 1.F.2.1, Program Application Programming
Interface.
1.B. Team Expertise
Collaborative efforts and teaming among Offerors are highly encouraged. It is anticipated that
teams will be multidisciplinary and may include expertise in one or more of the disciplines listed
below. This list is included only to provide guidance for Offerors; satisfying all the areas of
technical expertise below is not a requirement for selection and unconventional or innovative team
expertise may be needed based on the proposed research. Proposals shall include a description and
the mix of skills and staffing that the Offeror determines will be necessary to carry out the proposed
research and achieve the metrics.
• Speech and signal processing
• Speech synthesis
• Speech and speaker recognition
• Forensic speech science
• Natural language processing
• Linguistics 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 19 of 85
• Phonetics
• Acoustics
• Audio engineering
• Speech pathology
• Modeling and simulation
• Machine learning, deep learning, or hierarchical modeling
• Artificial intelligence
• Systems integration
• Systems engineering
• Software engineering
• Data reduction and analysis
1.B.1 Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals shall explicitly address all of the following:
• Underlying Theory: Proposed strategies to meet program-specified metrics must have firm
theoretical bases that are described with enough detail that reviewers will be able to assess
the viability of the approaches. Proposals shall properly describe and reference previous
work upon which their approach is founded.
• R&D Approach: Proposals shall describe the technical approach to meeting program
metrics.
• Technical Risks: Proposals shall identify technical risks and proposed mitigation strategies
for each.
• Software Development: Proposals shall describe the approach to software architecture and
integration.
The following areas of research and approaches are out of scope for the ARTS program:
• Research that does not have strong theoretical and experimental foundations.
• Development of hardware solutions or methods that require special hardware.
• Development of voice conversion or voice cloning systems, in which the aim is to convert
speech to sound like a specific target individual.
• Methods that require a human-in-the-loop as part of the integrated end-to-end system.
• Approaches that consist merely of integrating currently existing software.
Delivered software will be evaluated by an independent T&E team on sequestered and shared
evaluation datasets. Performers will build prototype algorithms and subcomponent modules that
will be run and evaluated by the T&E Team. Testing protocols do not allow for expert operators,
human-in-the-loop operation, or any operations not deemed “turnkey.” However, systems or
algorithms that have been trained using human-in-the-loop methods may be submitted, provided
they run autonomously. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 20 of 85
1.C. Program Data
For ARTS to facilitate innovative R&D and achieve program metrics, diverse program data in
sufficient quantities are needed for development and statistically reliable evaluations. As a result,
the program will include robust and explicit data provision and collection by the ARTS T&E Team.
Performer teams will not be permitted to record new speech data from human subjects in support
of the ARTS Program. However, teams may use existing external speech data sets that are
permissible to share with the Government, provided the Performer teams deliver those sets to the
Government for its own evaluation uses. Teams may also synthesize artificial speech data, where
there is no actual speaker, and they may acquire licenses to use publicly available datasets. All
data sets used in R&D must be made available to the Government upon system delivery.
The program will leverage existing data sets as well as collect and potentially simulate evaluation
data from approved sites. The data will consist of speech segments in durations 10s-60s, collected
with a range of conditions, sensors, and environments. Speech segments will reflect a range of
languages, dialects, genders, age groups, and short-term emotional states. Evaluation data will be
explicitly excluded from any algorithm training approaches and be withheld from Performers until
the completion of evaluation events (challenges). However, for each speaker in the evaluation data
set, the Government will provide sample segments to allow performers to model the individuals’
speech prior to evaluation. Segments used for evaluation will be edited to include speech from
only a single speaker.
For a corpus to be of value for speaker recognition, it must have the following properties:
1. It must contain segments from multiple speakers;
2. The distinction between the speakers must have been verified through reliable method
independent of the application of speaker recognition technology; and,
3. The corpus must contain at least two recordings of target speakers collected at different times
or under different conditions.
A primary source for data meeting these requirements comes from corpora hosted by the Linguistic
Data Consortium (LDC). A recent Government evaluation of data sets suitable for the purpose of
forensic speech analysis revealed 146 distinct data sets, including over 20 evaluation sets used by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Speaker Recognition Evaluation
(SRE). The review of these holdings also features a wide range of speech conditions, to include:
• Conversational
• Different levels of vocal effort (soft/whisper, shout, Lombard)
• Stress
• Physiology (illness, intoxication)
• Emotion
• Language/Dialect
• Non-Native Speech
• Sex/Gender
The T&E Teams will evaluate this collection of speech corpora to create sets for development and
evaluation.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 21 of 85
1.C.1 Development Data
A limited amount of sample data will be provided in advance of evaluation events to performers.
Sample data to serve as an example of formatting and to facilitate development of ingest tools will
be provided, although this data will not be sufficient in volume to facilitate algorithm training and
methodology development. The Government will provide sample data upon Program kick-off.
The Government will make additional development data sets available in both Phases of the
program. Data relevant for Phase 1 evaluations will be provided at Program months 3 and 12, and
data relevant for Phase 2 will be provided at Program months 21 and 30.
1.C.2 Evaluation Data
ARTS will utilize distinct test data to evaluate the performance of Performer subcomponents,
modules, and systems against program goals, objectives, and metrics. Intended uses of the
evaluation datasets include both use by the T&E Team for independent evaluation of program
deliverables against target metrics during quarterly challenges and use by Performers after these
challenges to refine and improve their algorithms. The evaluation datasets will be provided to
Performers to enable internal T&E and exploratory error analysis by Performers and to improve
the consistency and communication between Performers and T&E following each challenge. No
unreleased evaluation data will be permitted in any aspect of algorithm training or functionality
until after it has been used in an evaluation. Additional sequestered or external datasets may be
used to supplement performance evaluations at the discretion of the ARTS PM.
1.D. Test and Evaluation (T&E)
T&E will be conducted by an independent team of Government and contractor staff carrying out
evaluation and analyses of Performer research Deliverables using program test datasets and
protocols. In addition to independent T&E, the program will regularly gauge interim progress of
Performer research activities towards ARTS objectives and target metrics using T&E results
measured and reported by the Performer teams themselves. The ARTS evaluation data and test
protocols will be the primary mechanism by which the T&E Team carries out their evaluations.
The ARTS program will pursue rigorous and comprehensive T&E to ensure that research
outcomes are well characterized, deliverables are aligned with program objectives, and that
algorithm performance is measured across the full range of architectural, sensor, and
environmental conditions. Such T&E activities will not only inform IARPA and Government
stakeholders on ARTS research progress but will also serve as invaluable feedback to the
Performers to improve their research approaches, algorithm training practices, and system
development. The ARTS program will work closely with Government leaders in speech
processing, speaker recognition, and applied linguistics to continually refine and improve T&E
methodologies. Evaluations will occur quarterly through challenge events that will exercise
performer solutions across technical challenges described in section 1.A., independently and in
combination.
The Government will provide Performers with an API and requirements to integrate in a program
test harness with relevant scripts to run program test protocols on program datasets. T&E will
develop an ARTS Processing System (APS) to execute Performer Deliverables on evaluation
datasets. This processed data will be distributed amongst the T&E partners for evaluation against
the different TAs and utility constraints. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 22 of 85
Performers will have specific Deliverable Milestones when all subcomponent and system
algorithms and software will be delivered to IARPA and its designated T&E Team. The T&E
Team will then conduct evaluations at the direction of the ARTS PM and with the objective of
characterizing the quality, functionality, and performance of the ARTS Deliverables. In addition
to quantitative measurements, T&E will be carried out to establish a thorough understanding of
the progress, status, and limitations of the Performer’s research.
T&E results and feedback will be provided to Performers at regular intervals to keep them abreast
of current independent performance measurements and to inform and improve their R&D
approaches and methods. T&E results from all Performers will be shared with all teams to establish
an understanding of the current state and progress of ARTS research; T&E results will also be
shared with USG external stakeholders, including their contractors, for Government purposes. For
example, a PI Review Meeting will be held at the phase mid-point and at the end of each phase to
share research ideas, progress, and results across the ARTS program (reference 1.G.1.
Workshops).
IARPA may conduct other supplemental evaluations or measurements at its sole discretion to
evaluate the Performers’ research and Deliverables.
1.E. Program Metrics
Achievement of metrics is a performance indicator under IARPA research contracts. IARPA has
defined the ARTS program metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in
achieving the stated program goal and objectives, and to determine whether satisfactory progress
is being made. The metrics described in this BAA are shared with the intent to scope the effort,
while affording maximum flexibility, creativity, and innovation to Offerors proposing solutions to
the stated problem. Program metrics may be refined by the Government during the various phases
of the ARTS program; if metrics change, revised metrics will be communicated in a timely manner
to Performers.
At its core, ARTS is an R&D program focused on speech anonymization. Performance metrics are
focused on the ability to defeat speaker characterization threats, balanced with metrics to ensure
that solutions can meet the utility goals (practical needs and logistical challenges) of use cases.
Metrics were chosen with the following considerations:
1. What is technically achievable but challenging based on current state-of-the-art in the speech
processing R&D communities;
2. What is statistically measurable based on the planned program evaluation data; and
3. What is useful to mission partners based on USG stakeholder needs and use cases?
Although Performers must deliver interim solutions at different waypoints in the program, the
metrics are for use only with final Phase deliverables. For interim deliverables, the metrics may
serve as a measure of progress. The ARTS program may use these measurements to highlight
improvements, identify risks, and reassess relevance/realism of metrics. If the Performer’s metrics
indicate a lack of satisfactory progress, the Government reserves the right to fund all, or some of
the TAs at any time during performance of Phase 1. This also applies at the point of Option exercise
and at any time during performance of Phase 2. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 23 of 85
1.E.1 Metrics for TA1
The metric associated with TA1, SDID, is based on LLR scores produced by SID systems. For a
set of scores, the equal error rate (EER) is where the false alarm rate and the false miss rate are
equal. One situation is where a test segment is from a person enrolled in the SID system. For this
case, we say the target segment is known to be present in the test segment. Under this circumstance,
we expect very low EER. However, another situation is where the test segment is from a person
not enrolled in the SID system, in which case we say the target is not present in the test segment.
For this, we expect an EER to on average be around 50%, reflecting random guessing.
T&E will perform three types of SID attacks against output data. As noted above, the SID attack
for the final Phase deliverables will be one of an informed attacker, where T&E will use the
Performer systems to enroll pseudo-speakers into the SID database. The three attacks performed
in the final Phase deliverables are:
• SDID test segments against original target speakers: desired result is to have inconclusive
SID results. The EER should be above 45%. The target metric for this test is 0.5± 0.05.
• SDID test segments against non-matching target pseudo-speakers: desired result is to have
inconclusive SID results. The EER should be above 45%. The target metric for this test is
0.5± 0.05.
• SDID test segments against matching target pseudo-speakers: desired result is to show target
segments are present in test segments. The EER should be below 5%.
1.E.2 Metrics for TA2
The metric associated with TA2, static trait replacement, is based on the accuracy of a panel of
human evaluators. The listeners will assess samples and predict the category for dialect, gender,
and cohort. A correct prediction is one where the assessment matches the randomly selected trait.
For each category within a profile, accuracy will be computed as:
# 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑐𝑐 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
# 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑝𝑝
T&E Teams will also produce accuracy measures for original (unprocessed) data. The target metric
for each category at the end of each Phase will be the panel’s average accuracy for original data.
1.E.3 Metrics for TA3
The T&E Teams will use three deep CNNs to evaluate data under TA3. Using the openSMILE 3.0
toolkit, a set of over 4k LLD features will be extracted from unprocessed emotional datasets such
as the IEMOCAP data, establishing two classes. One class will contain speech with positive traits,
(happy and excited) and the other class will have speech with negative traits (angry and sad). T&E
will use supervised training approaches to train CNN-4, ResNet-50, and VGG-16 networks.
T&E will assess the output from the TA3 module by evaluating the same set of LLD features
extracted from transformed speech from module 3. The performance will be measured by
unweighted average recall (UAR), with a target metric of 0.48.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 24 of 85
1.E.4 Metrics for Latency
In order to obtain independent, consistent, repeatable test and evaluation results, T&E will use the
APS to execute all interim and final Phase deliverables. The motivation for this is to ensure that
latency can be processed reliably as speech is processed. Once test segments are transformed, the
output files can be evaluations against the TAs and other utility constraints on other T&E test
systems. Latency is the only metric which must be processed on the APS.
The APS will take an input test segment in the form of an uncompressed Waveform Audio File
(WAV file) in the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format. The output of a Performer’s
system shall produce a WAV file with the modified speech. Software will mark the time in which
the output speech triggers SAD, and the difference between the time of input and SAD will be
considered the duration.
The event that triggers SAD does not necessarily have to be the same event that would trigger
SAD on an input signal. However, Performers shall consider impact that introducing synthesized
artifacts could have on metrics for other aspects of this program.
Latency will be measured in millisecond (ms), and target metrics will be on the order of common
communication channels, such as satellite or VoIP phones. The target metric for final Phase 1
deliverables is 350ms, and the target metric for final Phase 2 deliverables is 150ms.
1.E.5 Metrics for Understandability
T&E will evaluate output speech to ensure that the understandability of transformed speech is
within reason. This will be accomplished by using Kaldi ASR on processed speech and comparing
with ground truth transcripts of the segments. With this approach, discourse markers will be
ignored, and the word error rate will be measured by comparing ground truth transcripts with ASR
output and computing the number of wrong words (substitutions), missing words (deletions), and
addition of words (insertions). Thus, ignoring discourse markers and lexical choices based on
synonyms, we have the following:
• 𝑆𝑆 is the number of substitutions (unintentional wrong word)
• 𝐷𝐷 is the number of deletions (missing word)
• 𝐼𝐼 is the number of insertions (added word)
• 𝑁𝑁 is the number of words
• The word error rate is computed 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 =
𝑆𝑆+𝐷𝐷+𝐼𝐼
𝑁𝑁
Because ASR systems are not perfect and quality of data sets can vary, T&E Teams will compute
the baseline WER on original, unprocessed data. In addition, T&E will compute WER for two
baseline anonymization systems. The target metric in Phase 1 for understandability of output
speech is the mean of WER for original data and WER for baseline methods of anonymization.
Intuitively, this means the performance loss for understandability is cut in half from existing
anonymization systems. The target metric for Phase 2 builds on the figures for Phase 1, using the
mean of original WER and Phase 1 WER, which can be viewed as cutting the performance loss in
half again.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 25 of 85
1.E.6 Metrics for Naturalness
The ARTS program aims to produce solutions that can transform speech and continue to sound
natural. T&E will assess naturalness with a panel of ~200 unique listeners, balanced in gender,
with individuals assessing a small set of output speech. For this evaluation, listeners will be
informed that they will hear test segments that may be of high quality, but some may sound
artificial due to deterioration caused by computer processing. Participants will then evaluate
segments on a Likert scale (1-Bad, 2-Poor, 3-Fair, 4-Good, and 5-Excellent). This range is
commonly used in human evaluations of speech and is intended to capture a range of feelings for
a given item. The mean opinion score (MOS), which is the arithmetic mean of scores, will be
computed for output from the solution systems, with a target metric of 3.5 for Phase 1, which
reflects speech that is considered to have a natural quality of Fair to Good. The target metric for
Phase 2 is 4.5, reflecting an assessment of Good to Excellent. The MOS will also be computed for
original, unprocessed data, but will not be used in the target metrics. The MOS scores for original
data will be used for informational uses only, such as a point of reference if targets should need to

1.F.2 Software Deliverable Formatting
Performers will be required to provide algorithm and software deliverables in a manner that
conforms to a standardized industrial method or methods that will be provided at program Kickoff.
To facilitate planning, Offerors may assume that the standardized configuration will require the
use of software containerization technology (e.g., Docker and a REST API). This means that the
entirety of a Performer’s system, including pre- and post-processing, must be included within the
delivered software container. For models that require training, the initial model training shall occur
on Performer systems, with the ability for the T&E Team to re-train and test the model with the
same and/or other data. All solutions shall be delivered with associated source code and
documentation.
Each team is required to include among their Key Personnel a Lead System Integrator (LSI) who
shall be responsible for preparing software Deliverable subcomponents, modules, and systems,
performing quality control of Deliverable, and integrating key components into the primary ARTS
system(s). The LSI will also oversee communication and coordination across a Performer’s
research teams including subcontractors, if applicable, to ensure research products are functional,
integrated and following software coding best practices (e.g., inline comments, documentation).
Additional team members and roles are dependent on the proposed research, as such, there is no
predetermined or required skill mix.
1.F.2.1 Program API
The ARTS program will be utilizing a standardized API for all software deliverables and
evaluations. The first version of the ARTS API will be provided to Performers at the Phase 1 Kickoff Meeting and updated periodically thereafter. The API will define function calls, data structures,
and gallery creation and management for operating and evaluating ARTS software in a
standardized manner.
1.G. Meeting and Travel Requirements
Performers shall assume responsibility for administration of their projects and shall comply with
contractual and program requirements for reporting, attendance at program workshops, and
availability for site visits. The following paragraphs describe typical expectations for meetings and
travel for IARPA programs as well as the contemplated frequency and locations of such meetings.
In addition to ensuring that all necessary details of developed software, algorithm, and operational
instructions are clear and complete, each Performer will be required to be available for questions
and troubleshooting from the T&E Team in weekly and/or bi-weekly status meetings.
1.G.1 Kickoff Meetings and PI Workshops
All Performer teams are expected to attend workshops, to include Key Personnel from prime and
subcontractor organizations.
The ARTS program intends to hold a program Kick-off Meeting workshop in the first month of
the program and first month of each subsequent program phase. In addition, the program will hold
a PI Review Meeting at the end of each phase and at the phase midpoint. Kick-off Meetings and
PI Review Meetings may be combined for logistical convenience. The dates and locations of these
meetings are to be specified at a later date by the Government, but for planning purposes, Offerors
shall use the approximate schedule listed in Table 4. Both types of meetings will likely be held in 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 31 of 85
the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, but IARPA may opt to co-locate the meeting with a
relevant external conference or workshop to increase synergy with stakeholders.
Kick-off Meetings will typically be two days in duration and will focus on plans for the coming
Phase, Performer planned research, and internal program discussions. PI Review Meetings will
typically be two days in duration and will have a greater focus on communicating program progress
and plans to USG stakeholders. These meetings will include additional time allocated to
presentation and discussion of research accomplishments and interactive demonstrations for
Government stakeholders.
In both cases, the workshops will focus on technical aspects of the program and on facilitating
open technical exchanges, interaction, and sharing among the various program participants.
Program participants will be expected to present the technical status and progress of their projects
to other participants and invited guests. Individual sessions for each Performer team with the
ARTS PM and T&E Team may be scheduled to coincide with these workshops. Non-proprietary
information will be shared by Performers in the open meeting sessions; proprietary information
sharing shall occur during individual breakout sessions with the ARTS PM and T&E.
1.G.2 Site Visits
Site visits by the Government Team will generally take place semi-annually during the life of the
program. These visits will occur at the Performer’s facility. Reports on technical progress, details
of successes and issues, contributions to the program goals, and technology demonstrations will
be expected at such site visits. IARPA reserves the right to conduct additional site visits on an asneeded basis or virtually if desired.
1.H. Anticipated Period of Performance
Anticipated PoP: 36 Months as follows:
Phase 1: 1 May 2024 – 31 October 2025
Phase 2: 1 November 2025 – 30 April 2027
Note: Proposals shall include a solution for Phases 1 and 2, inclusive of all Technical Areas.
1.I. Place of Performance
Performance will be conducted at the Performers’ sites.

SECTION 2: AWARD INFORMATION
The Government intends to award procurement contracts encompassing two (2) Phases of the
program from this BAA. Proposersshall propose to all technical areas. The Government anticipates
issuing multiple awards in response to this full and open competition BAA. Exercise of the Option
Period shall depend upon performance during Phase 1 – Base Period, as well as program goals,
the availability of funds, and IARPA priorities. Exercising Option Period 1 – Phase 2, is at the sole
discretion of the Government. Selection to perform Option Period 1 – Phase 2 will be made via
FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000).
Multiple awards are anticipated. The resources made available under this BAA shall depend on
the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.
The DOI reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received in
response to this BAA and to make awards without discussions. The DOI also reserves the right to
conduct discussions, if determined to be necessary. Additionally, DOI reserves the right to accept
proposals in their entirety or to select only portions of proposals for negotiations for award.
Evaluation and award of proposals will follow FAR Part 35 processes as described herein. The
Government shall not reimburse Proposers for any proposal costs incurred under this BAA.
Awards shall be made to Proposers on the basis of the Evaluation Factors listed in section 5 of this
BAA, as well as successful completion of negotiations. Proposals selected for negotiation may
result in a procurement contract.
The Government shall contact Proposers whose proposals are selected for negotiations to obtain
additional information required for award. The Government may establish a deadline for the close
of fact-finding and negotiations that allows a reasonable time for the award of a contract. Proposers
that are not responsive to Government deadlines established and communicated with the request
may be removed from award consideration. Proposers may also be removed from award
consideration should the parties fail to reach agreement within a reasonable time on contract terms,
conditions, and cost/price.
SECTION 3: ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION
3.A. Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government’s needs may submit a proposal.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses
and Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and team with others to submit
proposals; however, no portion of this announcement shall be set aside for these entities. Other
Government Agencies, Federally Funded R&D Centers, University Affiliated Research Centers
(UARC), Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated facilities, Government Military Academies,
and any other similar type of organizations that have a special relationship with the Government,
that gives them access to privileged and/or proprietary information or access to Government
equipment or real property, are not eligible to submit proposals under this BAA or participate as
team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. An entity of which only a portion
has been designated as a UARC may be eligible to submit a proposal or participate as a team
member subject to an organizational conflict of interest review. Foreign entities and/or individuals
may participate but only as a part of a U.S. based team and only IAW deemed export
restrictions/licensing requirements when applicable. The prime contractor must be a U.S. entity.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 36 of 85
Foreign entities and individuals may participate as subcontractors or employees of a U.S. entity;
however, all foreign participation must comply with any necessary Non-Disclosure Agreements,
Security Regulations, Export Control Laws, and other governing statutes applicable under the
circumstances. Proposers are responsible for ensuring that the efforts of foreign participants do not
either directly or indirectly compromise the laws of the United States, nor its security interests. As
such, both foreign and domestic Proposers shall carefully consider the roles and responsibilities of
foreign participants as they pursue teaming arrangements.
3.A.1 Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI)
According to FAR 2.101 “Organizational Conflict of Interest” means that because of other
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render
impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the
contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.
IAW FAR 9.5, Proposers are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to potential OCIs
involving the Proposer’s entity and any proposed team member (sub-contractor, consultant). Under
this Section, the Proposer is responsible for providing this disclosure with each proposal submitted
pursuant to the BAA. The disclosure must include the Proposer’s, and as applicable, proposed team
member’s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include a description of the actions
the Proposer has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might
bias the Proposer’s judgment and to prevent the Proposer from having an unfair competitive
advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI in the context of
each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.
IARPA generally prohibits Performers from concurrently providing Scientific Engineering
Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar support
services and being a technical Performer. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement
above, address whether a Proposer or a team member (e.g., subcontractor, consultant) is providing
SETA, A&AS, or similar support (e.g., T&E services) to IARPA under: (a) a current award or
subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward.
If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is or was being provided to IARPA, the proposal must include:
(1) The name of the IARPA program or office receiving the support;
(2) The prime contract number, and;
(3) Identification of proposed team member (sub awardee, consultant) providing the support.
As part oftheir proposal, Proposersshall include either(a) a copy of their OCI notification including
mitigation plan or (b) a written certification that neither they nor their subcontractor teammates have
any potential conflicts of interest, real or perceived. A sample certification is provided in Appendix
A-4.
The Government will evaluate OCIs and potential OCIs to determine whether they can be avoided,
neutralized or mitigated and/or whether it is in the Government’s interest to grant a waiver. The
Government will make OCI determinations, as applicable, for proposals that are otherwise
selectable under the BAA Evaluation Factors. The Government may require Proposers to provide
additional information to assist the Government in evaluating OCIs and OCI mitigation plans.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 37 of 85
If the Government determinesthat a Proposer failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide the
affirmation of IARPA support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional
information requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the Proposer’s OCI and proposed
OCI mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration
for award under this BAA.
3.A.2 Multiple Submissions to the BAA
Entities may participate as a prime or subcontractor in more than one submission to the BAA.
However, if multiple submissions to the BAA which include a common team member are selected,
such common team members shall not receive duplicative funding (i.e., no one entity can be paid
twice to perform the same task).
3.B. U.S. Academic Institutions
According to Executive Order 12333, as amended, paragraph 2.7, “Elements of the Intelligence
Community (IC) are authorized to enter into contracts or arrangements for the provision of goods
or services with private companies or institutions in the United States and need not reveal the
sponsorship of such contracts or arrangements for authorized intelligence purposes. Contracts or
arrangements with academic institutions may be undertaken only with the consent of appropriate
officials of the institution.”
Proposers must submit a completed and signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter for
each U.S. academic institution that is a part of their team, whether the academic institution is
serving in the role of a prime, or a subcontractor or a consultant at any tier of their team with their
technical proposal. Each Letter must be signed by a senior official from the institution (e.g.
President, Chancellor, Provost, or other appropriately designated official). A template of the
Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter is enclosed in Appendix A-2 of this BAA.
Note that DOIshall not enterinto negotiations with a Proposer whose teamincludes a U.S. academic
institution until all required Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters are received.
3.C. Other Eligibility Criteria
3.C.1 Collaboration Efforts
Collaborative efforts and teaming arrangements among potential Proposers are strongly
encouraged. Specific content, communications, networking, and team formations are the sole
responsibility of interested Proposers.

Only Government personnel will make evaluation and award determinations under this BAA.
4.B. Proposal Format and Content
To facilitate the evaluation of the proposal, the government encourages Proposers to submit
proposals which: are clear and concise; are limited to essential matters sufficient to demonstrate a
complete understanding of the Government’s requirements; include sufficient detail for effective
evaluation; and provide a convincing rationale to address how the Proposer intends to meet these
requirements and objectives, rather than simply rephrasing or restating the Government’s
requirements and objectives.
All proposals shall be in the format outlined below. Non-compliant proposals may be rejected
without review. Proposals shall consist of “Volume I - Technical and Management Proposal” and,
only if requested (see BAA sections 4.B.2. and 5.B.), “Volume II - Cost Proposal.” All proposals

J. Resource Share. Include the type of support, if any, the Proposer might request from the
Government, such as facilities, equipment, materials, or any such resources the Proposer is
willing to provide at no additional cost to the Government to support the research effort.
Cost sharing is not required from Proposers and is not an evaluation criterion but is
encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application
related to the proposed R&D effort.
K. The names of other federal, state or local agencies or other parties receiving the
proposal and/or funding the proposed effort. If none, state “None”. Concurrent
submission of the proposal to other organizations will not prejudice its review but may
impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort. See 5.A.2.1.
L. Research Data Management Plan. (RDMP). Submit a RDMP that outlines how they will
manage and preserve the Research Data, as defined below, collected or produced through
the course of performance. The RDMP need not require the preservation of all Research
Data: Proposers shall consider the cost and benefits of managing and preserving the
Research Data in determining whether to preserve it. At a minimum, all Research Data
associated with a peer-reviewed manuscript or final published article (hereinafter
“Publications”) must be made publicly accessible by the award recipient before, on or at a
reasonable time after the publication date. The Publications associated data must be
covered in this RDMP.
Research Data is defined herein as the digital recorded factual material commonly accepted
in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings including data sets
used to support scholarly publications, but does not include laboratory notebooks,
preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review
reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory
specimens.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 47 of 85
The RDMP must address the following:
(1) Describe the types of Research Data collected or produced in the course of
the project. Include standards to be used for Research Data and metadata
content and format.
(2) A plan for making the Research Data that underlie Publications digitally
accessible to the public before or, at the time of publication or conference
presentation, or within a reasonable time after publication. The requirement
could be met by including the data as supplementary information to the
Publication or by depositing the Research Data in a searchable, machine
readable and digitally accessible form suitable for repositories available to
the public free of charge. Such repositories could be discipline- specific
repositories, general purpose research data repositories or institutional
repositories. The published article or conference paper shall indicate how the
public may access Research Data underlying the paper’s results and findings.
Proposers shall attempt to make the Research Data available for at least three
years after published article or conference. (NOTE: Proposers shall make a
best effort in identifying research data sets that may be used for Publications
that occur after contract end. The Proposer shall deliver these data sets to the
Government and make them available in repositories available to the public
prior to the end of the PoP, if not included as supplementary information to
Publications.)
(3) Policies and provisions for sharing and preservation, including a) policies
and provisions for appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security,
and IP, b) descriptions of tools, including software, needed to access and
interpret the Research Data, and c) policies and provisions for re-use, redistribution, and production of derivatives.
(4) If, for legitimate reasons (e.g., privacy, confidentiality, security, IP rights
considerations; size of data sets, cost; time), the Research Data underlying the
results of peer-reviewed publications or conference papers cannot be shared
and preserved, the plan must include a justification citing such reasons.
In addressing these elements (e.g., types of data to be shared and preserved, standards to be used
for data and metadata, repositories to be used for archiving data, timeframes for sharing and
preservation), the RDMP shall reflect the best practices of the relevant scientific discipline and
research community. At a minimum, Research Data underlying Publications and associated
metadata shall include an acknowledgement of IARPA support and a link to the associated
Publication.

4.B.1.4 Section 4: Attachments
Each attachment listed below shall be included with the proposal, if applicable. They do not count
against the Volume I-page limit.
Attachment 1. Signed Academic Institution Acknowledgement Letter(s) (if applicable). A
template is provided in Appendix A-1.
Attachment 2. Intellectual Property Rights. This attachment is estimated not to exceed 4 pages
and shall address the following:
(1) Representation as to Rights. A Proposer shall provide a good faith representation that they
either own or have sufficient licensing rights to all IP that will be utilized under their
proposal.
(2) Program-Specific IP Approach. IARPA requires sufficient rights to IP developed or used
in the conduct of the proposed research to ensure that IARPA can successfully (a) manage
the program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables, (b) communicate program
information across Government organizations, and (c) support transition to and further use
and development of the program results by IC users and others. IARPA anticipates that
achieving these goals for the ARTS program will necessitate a minimum of Unlimited
Rights in all deliverables. However, there may be any number of other approaches to
intellectual property rights to achieve IARPA’s program goals. As outlined in FAR 52.227-
14 Rights in Data-General, “Unlimited rights” means the rights of the Government to use,
disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform
publicly and display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit
others to do so. In addressing their approach to IP rights, Proposers shall (1) describe the
intended use of patented invention(s) or data, including, technical data and computer
software, in the conduct of the proposed research; (2) describe the rights being offered to
the Government along with a justification if less than Unlimited Rights is being offered;
(3) explain how IARPA will be able to reach its program goals (including transition) with
the rights offered to the Government; (4) identify the cost to the Government to acquire
additional or alternative rights beyond those being offered, if applicable; and (5) provide
possible alternatives in any area in which the offered rights may be insufficient for IARPA
to achieve its program goals (e.g., the possibility of future licensing of privately-developed
software to U.S. Government agencies at a reasonable cost.)
(3) Patented Inventions. Proposers proving ownership of or sufficient rights to all inventions
(or inventions for which a patent application has been filed) that will be utilized under the
proposal for the IARPA program. If a patent application has been filed for an invention
that the proposal intends to utilize, but the application has not yet been made publicly
available and contains proprietary information, the Proposer may provide only the serial
number, inventor name(s), assignee names (if any), filing date, filing date of any related
provisional application, and a summary of the patent title, together with either: (1) a
representation that the Proposer owns the invention, or (2) proof of sufficient licensing
rights in the invention. Proposers shall also indicate their intention to incorporate patented
technology into any deliverable- i.e., if Proposers intend for any deliverable to embody any
invention covered by any patent or patent application listed by the Proposers in Volume I,
Appendix A-3, Proposers shall also specify in the Attachment the deliverable into which 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 49 of 85
the Proposers expects to incorporate the invention. In doing so, the Government requests
that Proposers further specify any rights offered to the Government for inventions that will
be utilized in the program (beyond the implied license that accompanies a patent owner’s
sale of a patented product).
(4) Noncommercial Data. Proposers shall identify all noncommercial data, including
technical data and computer software, that it plansto generate, develop and/or deliver under
any proposed award instrument in which the Government shall acquire less than unlimited
rights. In doing so, Proposers must assert (a) the specific restrictions the Government’s
rights in those deliverables, (b) the basis for such restrictions, (c) the intended use of the
technical data and noncommercial computer software in the conduct of the proposed R&D
of applicable deliverables, and (d) a supporting rationale of why the proposed approach to
data rights is in the Government’s best interest (please see program specific goals above).
If no restrictions are intended, then the Proposer shall state “NONE.”
(5) Commercial Data. Proposers shall identify all commercial data, including technical data
and commercial computer software, that may be included in any deliverables contemplated
under the research effort and assert any applicable restrictions on the Government’s use of
such commercial data (please see program specific goals above). If no restrictions are
intended, then the Proposer shall state “NONE.”
(6) Data Developed with Mixed Funding. If mixed funding is anticipated in data generated,
developed, and/or delivered under the research effort, the Government seeks at minimum
“Government Purpose Rights” (GPR) for all noncommercial data deliverables; offering
anything less shall be considered a weakness in the proposal. United States Government
purposes include any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including
cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales
or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international
organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include
the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or
computer software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so. Government
Purpose Rights continue for a five-year period upon execution of the contract, upon
expiration of the five-year period, the Government obtains Unlimited Rights in the data.
(7) Open Source. If Proposers propose the use of any open-source data or freeware, any
conditions, restrictions or other requirements imposed by that software shall also be
addressed. Proposers shall leverage the format in Appendix A.3 for their response.
(8) Identification of Relevant Government Contracts. For all technical data and computer
software that a Proposer intends to deliver with other than unlimited rights that are identical
or substantially similar to technical data and computer software that the Proposer has
produced for, delivered to, or is obligated to deliver to the Government under any contract
or subcontract, the Proposer shall identify (a) the contract number under which the data,
software, or documentation was produced; (b) the contract number under which, and the
name and address of the organization to whom, the data and software was most recently
delivered or shall be delivered; and (c) any limitations on the Government’s rights to use
or disclose the data and software, including, when applicable, identification of the earliest
date the limitations expire.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 50 of 85
(9) Definitions. For this solicitation, IARPA recognizes only the definitions of IP rights IAW
the terms as set forth in FAR Part 27 Patents, Data, and Copyrights or as defined herein. If
Proposers propose IP rights that are not defined in FAR Part 27 or herein, Proposers shall
clearly define such rights in the “Intellectual Property Rights” Attachment of their
proposal. Proposers are reminded of the requirement for prime contractors to acquire
sufficient rights from subcontractors to accomplish the program goals.
(10) Evaluation. The Government will use the asserted data rights during the evaluation
process to evaluate the impact of any identified restrictions. The technical content of the
“Intellectual Property Rights” Attachment shall include only the information necessary to
address the proposed approach to IP; any other technical discussion in the attachment shall
not be considered during the evaluation process.
Attachment 3: OCI Notification or Certification Template provided in Appendix A-4.
Attachment 4: A Three Chart Summary of the Proposal. A PowerPoint summary that quickly and
succinctly indicates the concept overview, key innovations, expected impact, and other unique
aspects of the proposal. The format for the summary slides is included in Appendix A-5 and is
required to be used by the Proposer. Attachment 4 does not count against the page limit. Slide 1
shall be a self-contained, intuitive description of the technical approach and performance. These
slides may be used during the evaluation process to present a summary of the proposal from the
Proposer’s view.
Attachment 5: Research Data Management Plan. (Estimated as 2 to 3 pages). Template provided
in Appendix A-6 and is required to be used by the Proposer.
Attachment 6: Privacy Plan (No page limit). No template provided.
Attachment 7: Bibliography. A brief bibliography of relevant technical papers and research notes
(published and unpublished) which document the technical ideas on which the proposal is based.
No template provided.
Attachment 8: Relevant Papers. Copies of not more than three relevant papers may be included
in the submission. The Proposers shall include a one-page technical summary of each paper
provided, suitable for individuals who are not experts in the field. No template provided.
Attachment 9: Consultant Commitment Letters. If needed. No template provided.
Attachment 10: Human Use Documentation. See section 6.B.3. No template provided. Not
anticipated for the ARTS program. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 51 of 85
4.B.2 Volume II: Cost Proposal (No Page Limit)
NOTE: This Volume is only required if the Offeror’s proposal has been selected for
negotiation (see BAA Section 5.B and 5.C). The notification of selection for negotiation will
be issued in writing by the CO and will include a request to submit the full Cost Volume
within 10 business days or as otherwise authorized by the CO.
DOI anticipates awarding cost-type procurement contracts; however, Proposers requesting other
than a cost type-procurement contract (i.e., FFP contract) may be directed by the CO to provide
“other than certified cost or pricing data” (reference FAR Part 15.4) and/or cost supporting
information in a different format than described below. The CO may consider granting the request
to award a non-cost-type procurement contract under the following circumstances:
• Small Businesses,
• Start-Up companies,
• Consortia that may include universities and non-profits or;
• Where cost-sharing or government participation in the work is appropriate;
• Where flexibility not available under a procurement contract is needed; or
• Where commercialization by industry is deemed advantageous to the Government.
Regardless of the type of instrument determined to be appropriate by the CO, the Proposer’s cost
proposal shall contain sufficient factual information to establish the Proposer’s understanding of
the project, the perception of project risks, the ability to organize and perform the work and to
support the realism and reasonableness of the proposed cost, to the extent appropriate. DOI
recognizes that undue emphasis on cost may motivate Proposers to offer low-risk ideas with
minimum uncertainty and to staff the effort with junior personnel in order to be in a more
competitive posture. DOI discourages such cost strategies. Cost reduction approaches that shall be
received favorably include innovative management concepts that maximize direct funding for
technology and limit diversion of funds into overhead.
4.B.2.1 Section 1: Cover Sheet.
See Appendix B.1 for the Cover Sheet Template. Proposers must use and submit this template.
4.B.2.2 Section 2: Estimated Cost Breakdown.
Proposers must submit numerical cost and pricing data using the ARTS Cost Proposal Template.
The Excel files shall not be password protected. The cost proposal template tabbed by each Task
Area (TA-1, TA-2, and TA-3),shall include intact formulas and shall not be hard numbered. Within
the Cost Proposal, each TA’s Cost shall be 100% segregated to allow the Government the flexibility
to fund at the TA level.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 52 of 85
Proposers must complete the Cost Proposal Template as follows:
• Propose costs for all technical areas for both phases.
NOTE: Proposers must propose for all phases and all TAs to be considered for award.
• Each TA must have the base and one option phase total in the total all phases tab.
• Separate Tabs for Base and Optional Phase are provided for Labor/Indirect Rates,
Subcontractors, Consultants, Materials/Supplies, Equipment, Travel, and Other Direct
Cost (ODC) Details.
• Each tab includes helpful instructions.
• Any proposed Cost Sharing shall be reflected in a separate spreadsheet created and
provided by Proposers.
4.B.2.3 Section 3: Supporting Information
In addition to the above, supporting cost and pricing information shall be provided in sufficient
detail to substantiate the Proposer’s cost estimates. Include a description of the Basis of Estimate
(BOE) in a narrative for each cost element and provide supporting documentation, as applicable:
Direct Labor. Provide a complete cost breakout by labor category, hours and rates (template
available as Attachment). Specify all Key Personnel by name and clearly state their labor category
and proposed rate. Describe the basis of the proposed rates and provide a copy of the most recent
Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) and/or Forward Pricing Rate Recommendation (FPRR)
with the Government. If Proposers do not have a current FPRA with the Government, provide
payroll records or contingency hire letters with salary data to support each proposed labor category,
including those for key individuals, and the most recent Forward Pricing Rate Proposal
Submission, if applicable. Proposer shall also address whether any portion of their labor rates is
attributable to uncompensated overtime.
Labor Escalation Factor. State the proposed escalation rate and the basis for that rate (e.g., based
upon Global Insight indices, Cost Index or historical data). If the escalation rate is based upon
historical data, provide data to demonstrate the labor escalation trend. Provide a sample calculation
demonstrating application of the factor to direct labor including the last three years (if available)
of historical labor escalation that was incorporated into Government contracts.
Subcontracts. (To include consultants and Inter-organizational Transfers (IOTs)) – The Proposer
is responsible for compiling and providing full subcontractor proposals with the Cost Volume.
Subcontractor cost element sheets shall be completed for the base period, the option period and the
total summary using the same format required for the prime contractor (See Attachment C). If
available, provide a copy of the most recent FPRA and/or FPRR with the Government. Information
shall be presented in Excel with intact formulas using the format provided as an Attachment and
addressing the supporting cost information as outlined in Section 4 of the BAA. In addition to the
full and complete subcontractor cost proposals, the Proposer shall also provide its analysis of each
subcontractor’s proposal including justification for why the subcontractor was selected and its
determination that the cost/price is fair and reasonable (Reference FAR Part 44 Subcontracting
Policies and Procedures and FARclause 52.244-2 Subcontracts). Ifsubcontractors have concerns
about proprietary cost information, then subcontractors can contact the CO for instructions.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 53 of 85
CO Instruction: If a subcontractor has concerns about proprietary cost information, subcontractors
will not initially have to provide a complete cost breakout in the IARPA Distribution and
Evaluation System (IDEAS). Subcontractors shall provide the overall cost and technical area so
the prime can provide an accurate overall total cost. Only after selection as a potential
Prime/subcontractor awardee, the CO will then ask the subcontractor for a full cost breakout.
Materials and Equipment. Provide copies of quotes, bill of materials, historical data, past
invoices, or any other information including Proposer’s analysis to support proposed costs.
Travel. The proposed travel supporting detail shall include destination and purpose of the trip,
number of trips, number of travelers and days per trip and price per traveler in sufficient detail to
verify the BOE. Proposed travel costs shall comply with the limitations set forth in FAR Part 31
Contract Cost Principles and Procedures.
Proposed conference travel must have an immediate, direct, and tangible benefit to the
Government such as providing a deliverable at the conference (e.g., gives a presentation, presents
a paper or research findings that are sponsored in whole or in part by IARPA).
Travel for personnel to simply attend a conference will not be approved as a direct charge to the
contract.
Other Direct Costs (ODCs). ODCs shall be listed separately and supported by quotes, historical
data or any other information including the Proposer’s analysis.
Indirect Costs. The Proposer shall show indirect cost calculations, identify the proposed indirect
rate by contractor fiscal year and program period (base, option period) and provide information on
indirect cost pools and allocation bases for each year and program period involved. If a Government
agency recently audited the Proposer’s indirect rates, the Proposer shall identify the agency that
conducted the audit, when the rates were approved and the period for which they are effective.
Include a copy of this rate agreement. Absent current Government rate recommendations, it is
incumbent on the Proposer to provide other means of demonstrating indirect rate realism (e.g., 3
years of historical actual costs with applicable pools and bases). If proposed rates vary significantly
from historical experience, the Proposer shall explain the variance.
Cost Sharing. Describe the source, nature and amount of cost-sharing, if any. Reference Resource
Share from Section 4.B.1.c, paragraph J of the BAA
Other Pricing Assumptions. Identify all pricing assumptions that shall be incorporated into the
resulting award instrument (e.g., use of Government Furnished Property/Facilities/Information,
access to Government Subject Matter Experts, etc.). Reference Resource Share from Section 4 of
the BAA.
Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM). If proposing FCCM, the Proposer shall show FCCM
cost calculations, identify the proposed FCCM factors by contractor fiscal year and program year
and provide a copy of the FPRA, Forward Price Rate System (FPRS) or FPRR, if available.
Profit/Fee. Identify the proposed profit or fee percentage and the proposed profit/fee base. Provide
justification for your proposed profit or fee.

Business Systems. For the Business Systems listed below, provide a brief description of the
cognizant federal agency responsible for auditing these Business Systems and any audit results. If
the system has been determined inadequate, provide a short narrative describing the steps your
organization has taken to address the inadequacies and the current status. If a formal audit has been
performed by a Government Agency, please provide a complete copy of the audit report or
adequacy determination letter. If the system has never received a formal Government review and
approval, include a statement to that effect. Address whether your organization has contracts that
are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered and if so, whether they are subject to full or
modified CAS coverage.
• Accounting System
• Purchasing System
• Estimating System
For any proposer without a deemed adequate accounting system, DOI will require the attached
DCAA Pre- Award Survey of Prospective Contractor Accounting System Checklist to be
submitted by proposer.
Certified Cost or Pricing Data. Certified Cost or Pricing Data may be requested for procurement
contract awards that exceed the threshold for submittal as set forth in the FAR, unless the CO
approves an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data. (Reference FAR Part
15.403 Obtaining certified cost or pricing data.)

certifications and permitted additional information in ‘pdf’ format, or as otherwise directed (Excel,
PowerPoint, etc.). Proposers are responsible for ensuring a compliant and timely submission of
their proposals to meet the BAA submittal deadlines. Time management to upload and submit is
the responsibility of the Proposer.
Note: IDEAS will require Proposers complete a proposal cover sheet within IDEAS at the time
that Volume I – Technical and Management Proposal is submitted. This is separate and distinct
from the Technical and Cost Volume cover sheets referenced in 4.B.1.a. and 4.B.2.a. (Also
provided in Appendices A and B). Information requested within IDEAS will include basic cost
information (Total funds requested from IARPA, proposed costs by option period and validity 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 55 of 85
period). Please complete the requested information, but DO NOT upload your Volume II – Cost
Proposal. Directions for submittal of Volume II – Cost Proposal will be provided by the CO when
Offerors are notified of selection for negotiations.
Upon completing the proposal submission, the Proposer shall receive an automated confirmation
e-mail from IDEAS. Please forward that automated message to
IARPA_DOI_ARTS@IBC.DOI.Gov, Kevin_Woody@ibc.doi.gov and
William_Galvin@ibc.doi.gov
DOI strongly suggests that the Proposer document the submission of their proposal package by
printing the electronic receipt (time and date stamped) that appears on the final screen following
compliant submission of a proposal to the IDEAS website.
Volume I submitted by any means other than IDEAS (e.g., hand-carried, postal service,
commercial carrier and e-mail) shall not be considered unless the Proposer attempted electronic
submittal, but was unsuccessful and notified the Government using the following procedure below:
(1) The Proposer shall send an e-mail to IARPA_DOI_ARTS@IBC.DOI.Gov
Kevin_Woody@ibc.doi.gov and William_Galvin@ibc.doi.gov prior to the proposal due
date and time specified in the BAA and indicate that an attempt was made to submit
electronically, and that the submittal was unsuccessful.
(2) This e-mail shall include contact information for the Proposer. Upon receipt of such
notification, the Government will provide additional guidance regarding submission.
Proposals shall be submitted NLT October 16, 2023, Noon ET, in order to be considered for award.
Selection remains contingent on the technical and funding availability evaluation factors.
Proposals received after the BAA Closing Date are deemed to be late and will not be evaluated or
considered for award. Although classified proposals are not anticipated for this program, if a
Proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the Proposer must first contact DOI via
IARPA_DOI_ARTS@IBC.DOI.Gov Kevin_Woody@ibc.doi.gov and
William_Galvin@ibc.doi.gov for detailed submittal instructions. In no case shall classified
information be uploaded to IDEAS.
4.D. Funding Restrictions

SECTION 5: PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION
5.A. Technical and Funding Availability Evaluation Factors
The factors used to evaluate and select proposals for negotiation for this BAA are described in the
following paragraphs. Because there is no common SOW, each proposal shall be evaluated on its
own merits and its relevance to the Program goals rather than against other proposals submitted in
response to this BAA. The proposals shall be evaluated based on technical and funding availability
factors. These are of equal importance. Within the technical evaluation factor, the specific
technical criteria are in descending order of importance, as follows: Overall Scientific and
Technical Merit, Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan, Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA
Mission and Program Goal, Relevant Experience and Expertise, and Resource Realism. Specifics
about the evaluation criteria are provided below. Award(s) shall be made to a Proposer based on
the technical and funding availability factors listed below, and subject to successful negotiations
with the Government. Award shall not be made to Proposer(s) whose proposal(s) are determined not
to be selectable. Proposers are cautioned that failure to follow submittal and proposal instructions
may negatively impact their proposal evaluation or may result in rejection of the proposal for noncompliance.
5.A.1 Technical Evaluation Factor
5.A.1.1 Overall Scientific and Technical Merit
Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal is substantiated, including unique and
innovative methods, approaches, and/or concepts. The Proposer clearly articulates an
understanding of the problem to be solved. The technical approach is credible and includes a clear
assessment of primary risks and a means to address them. The proposed research advances the
state-of-the-art in a non-incremental manner.
5.A.1.2 Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan
The feasibility and likelihood that the proposed approach will satisfy the Program’s milestones
and metrics are explicitly described and clearly substantiated along with risk mitigation strategies
for achieving stated milestones and metrics. The proposal reflects a mature and quantitative
understanding of the program milestones and metrics, and the statistical confidence with which
they may be measured. Any Proposer proposed milestones and metrics are clear and well-defined,
with a logical connection to enabling Proposer decisions and/or Government decisions. The
schedule to achieve the milestones is realistic and reasonable.
The roles and relationships of the prime and sub-contractors are clearly delineated with all
participants fully documented. Work plans shall demonstrate the ability to provide full
Government visibility into and interaction with key technical activities and personnel, and a single
point of responsibility for contract performance. Work plans shall also demonstrate that all Key
Personnel and significant contributors have sufficient time committed to the Program to
accomplish their described Program roles.
The requirement and rationale for and the anticipated use or integration of Government resources,
including but not limited to equipment, facilities, information, etc., are fully described including
dates when such Government Furnished Property (GFP), Government Furnished Equipment
(GFE), Government Furnished Information (GFI) or other similar Government-provided resources 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 57 of 85
shall be required.
The Proposer’s RDMP is complete, addressing the types of data to be collected or produced,
describing how each type of data will be preserved and shared, including plans to provide public
access to peer reviewed publications and the underlying Research Data, or provides justifiable
rationale for not doing so.
5.A.1.3 Contribution and Relevance to the IARPA Mission and Program Goal
The proposed solution meets the letter and intent of the stated program goals and all elements
within the proposal exhibit a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The Proposer clearly
addresses how the proposed effort shall meet and progressively demonstrate the Program goals.
The Proposer describes how the proposed solution contributes to IARPA’s mission to invest in
high-risk/high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with an overwhelming intelligence
advantage.
The Proposer’s proposed IP and data rights are consistent with the Government’s need to be able
to effectively manage the program and evaluate the technical output and deliverables,
communicate program information across Government organizations and support transition to and
further use and development of the program results by IC users and others at a reasonable cost that
is acceptable to the Government. The proposed approach to IP rights is in the Government’s best
interest.
5.A.1.4 Relevant Experience and Expertise
The Proposer’s capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or a unique combination of
these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal's objectives, shall be evaluated, as well
as qualifications, capabilities, and experience of all Key Personnel and significant contributors
critical in achieving the program objectives.
5.A.1.5 Resource Realism (For Technical Evaluation)
The proposed resources demonstrate a clear understanding of the program, a perception of the risks
and the Proposer’s ability to organize and perform the work. The labor hours and mix are consistent
with the technical approach and are realistic for the work proposed. Material, equipment, software,
data collection and management, and travel, especially foreign travel, are well justified,
reasonable, and required for successful execution of the proposed work.
5.A.2 Funding Availability Factor
5.A.2.1 Budget Constraints
The Government will seek to maximize the likelihood of meeting program objectives within
program budget constraints. This may involve awarding one or more contracts.
Note: If the Proposer has submitted the proposal to other federal, state or local agencies or other
parties that may fund the proposed effort, it may impact IARPA’s decision to fund the effort.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 58 of 85
5.A.2.2 Program Balance
The Government will consider IARPA’s overall mission and program objectives, which may
include but are not limited to the following: broadening the variety of technical approaches to
enhance program outcomes, transitioning the technology to Government partners, developing
capabilities aligned with the priorities of the IC and national security.
5.B. Method of Evaluation and Selection Process
IARPA conducts impartial, equitable, comprehensive proposal reviews to select the source (or
sources) whose offer meets the Government's technical, policy and programmatic goals. For
evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in Section 4 of the BAA. Additional
supporting or background materials submitted with the proposal(s) not specified in Section 4 of
the BAA shall not be evaluated.
The contract award process for this BAA has two steps. The first step is selection for negotiations
and is made based on the review of the technical and funding availability factors (See BAA Section
5.A). The second step is cost negotiation and contract award. Contract award is contingent on CO
determination of a fair and reasonable cost/price and agreement on terms and conditions.
Selection for negotiation will be conducted through a peer or scientific review process led by the
IARPA Program Manager (PM). This process entails establishing a Scientific Review Panel (SRP)
made up of qualified Government personnel who will review and assess each proposal’s strengths,
weaknesses and risks1
 against the technical evaluation criteria. If necessary, non-Government
technical experts with specialized expertise may advise Government panel members and the PM.
However, only Government personnel will make selection recommendations and decisions under
this BAA.
Proposals will be reviewed individually and will not be compared against each other as they are not
submitted IAW a common SOW. When SRP reviews are complete, the PM will prepare a
recommendation to the IARPA Scientific Review Official (SRO) identifying proposals as
selectable, selectable with modification, or not selectable based on consideration of all stated
factors (technical and funding availability factors). The SRO will make the final decision as to
select ability for negotiations. At this point, Proposers will be notified in writing asto whether they
have been determined selectable,selectable with modification, or not selectable.
1 Strength: An aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has appreciable merit or appreciably exceeds
specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the
Government during contract performance.
Weakness: A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
Risk: The potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses the
degree to which an Offeror’s proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor
may involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance, the
need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract
performance. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 59 of 85
5.C. Negotiation and Contract Award
After selection and before award, the CO will contact Proposers whose proposals were selected or
selected with modifications to engage in negotiations. The CO will review the cost proposal using
the proposal analysis techniques described in FAR Part 31 as appropriate, to determine a fair and
reasonable cost. The CO’s evaluation will include review of proposed anticipated costs/prices of
the Proposer and those of associate, participating organizations, to ensure the Proposer has fully
analyzed the budget requirements, provided sufficient supporting information, has adequate
systems for managing the contract (accounting, purchasing), and that data is traceable and
reconcilable. The CO will also determine whether the prospective contractor meets the
responsibility standards of FAR Section 9.104 Standards. Additional information and supporting
data may be requested.
If proposed costs submitted are substantially different than the estimates provided in the technical
proposal, a contract may not be awarded.
Procurement contracts, as determined by the CO, shall be awarded to those Proposers whose
proposals are deemed most advantageous to the Government, all stated evaluation factors
considered, and pending the successful conclusion of negotiations.
5.D. Proposal Retention
Proposals shall not be returned upon completion of the source selection process. The original of
each proposal received shall be retained at DOI and IARPA and all other non-required copies
shall be destroyed. A certification of destruction may be requested, provided that the formal
request is sent to the DOI contracting agent via e-mail to IARPA_DOI_ARTS@IBC.DOI.Gov,
Kevin_Woody@ibc.doi.gov and William_Galvin@ibc.doi.gov within 5 days after notification of
proposal results.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 60 of 85
SECTION 6: AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION
6.A. Award Notices
As soon as practicable after the evaluation of a proposal is complete, the Proposer will be notified
that: (1) its proposal has been selected for negotiations, or (2) its proposal has not been selected
for negotiations.
6.B. Administrative and National Policy Requirements
6.B.1 Proprietary Data
IARPA treats all proposals as proprietary information and will disclose their contents only for the
purpose of evaluation. All proposals containing proprietary data shall have the cover page and each
page containing proprietary data clearly marked as containing proprietary data. It is the Proposer’s
responsibility to clearly define to the Government what the Proposer considers proprietary data.
6.B.2 Intellectual Property
General. The Government may request additional information from the Proposer, as may be
necessary, to evaluate the Proposer’s IP rights assertions. If Proposers do not identify any
restrictions with respect to a particular deliverable, the Government shall assume in its review of
the proposal that there are no restrictions on the Government’s use of such deliverables. Further,
failure to provide full information may result in a determination that the proposal is not compliant
with the BAA, and the Government reserves the right to reject a proposal if the Proposer does not
appropriately address all required IP rights issues.
IP Ownership. Regardless of the scope of the Government’s rights, Proposers may freely use data
for their own commercial purposes (unless restricted by the negotiated contract, U.S. export control
laws or security classification). Therefore, data including technical data and computer software
developed under any contract resulting from this BAA may remain the property of the Proposers,
subject to IARPA’s rights as set forth in the contract. IARPA seeks the rights to technical data
and/or computer software, developed, or used for the ARTS program IAW FAR 52.227-14 Rights
in Data-General. For inventions first conceived or actually reduced to practice under this effort,
IARPA will obtain a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have
practiced for or on its behalf, such invention throughout the world; Proposer may elect to retain title
as described in FAR 52.227-11 Patent Rights - Ownership by the Contractor.
Indemnification. Proposers expecting to use, but not to deliver, data or patentable inventions,
including commercial open-source tools in implementing their approach shall be required to
indemnify the Government against legal liability arising from such use.
Technical Data--Withholding of Payment. If technical data specified to be delivered under a
contract awarded under this BAA is not delivered within the time specified by the contract or is
deficient upon delivery (including having restrictive markings not specifically authorized by the
contract), the CO is permitted, until such data are accepted by the Government, to withhold payment
to the contractor. Payments may not be withheld, nor any other action taken pursuant to this
paragraph when the contractor's failure to make timely delivery or to deliver such data without
deficiencies arises out of causes beyond its control and without fault or negligence of the contractor.
The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the contractor shall not be construed as
a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government under the contract. 
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 61 of 85
6.B.3 Human Use (No research proposals involving human subjects are anticipated under
this BAA)
All research involving human subjects, to include use of human biological specimens and human
data, selected for funding must comply with the federal regulations for human subject protection,
namely 45 CFR Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects.
Institutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of
a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for
example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection
Federal Wide Assurance (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp). All institutions engaged in Human Subject
Research (HSR), to include subcontractors, must also have a valid Assurance. In addition to a
local Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, IARPA will review and approve the HSR
documentation before HSR may begin. However, IARPA does not require a secondary review by
a Government IRB.
For all proposed research that will involve human subjects, the institution must provide evidence
of or a plan for review by an IRB with the final proposal submission to IARPA as outlined in the
management plan. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution’s
Assurance. The informed consent document must comply with federal regulations (45 CFR Part
46).
The amount of time required to complete the IRB review/approval process may vary depending
on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants. Ample time should
be allotted to complete the approval process. No IARPA funding can be used towards human
subject research until ALL approvals are granted.
In limited instances, HSR may be exempt from Federal regulations for human subject protection,
for example, under Department of Health and Human Services, 45 CFR 46.101(b). Proposers
claiming that their research falls within an exemption from Federal regulations for human subject
protection must provide written documentation with their proposal that cites the specific applicable
exemption and explains clearly how their proposed research fits within that exemption.
6.B.4 Animal Use
No research proposals involving animal subjects shall be accepted under this BAA.
6.B.5 Publication Approval
It is anticipated that research funded under this Program shall be unclassified research that shall
not require a pre-publication review. However, Proposers shall note that pre-publication approval
of certain information may be required if it is determined that its release may result in the
disclosure of sensitive intelligence information. A courtesy soft copy of any work submitted for
publication shall be provided to the IARPA PM and the Contracting Officer Representative (COR)
a minimum of 5 business days prior to release in any forum.
DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01 Page 62 of 85
6.B.6 Export Control
(1) The Proposer shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 through 130, and
the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730 through 799, and any
amendments thereto, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license
exemptions/exceptions, the Proposer shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate
licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of (including deemed exports)
hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.
(2) The Proposer shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing
non-U.S. persons (as defined in the ITAR and EAR, as applicable) in the performance of a
contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at any Government
installation (whether in or outside the United States), where the foreign person shall have
access to export-controlled technologies, including technical data or software.
(3) The Proposershall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated
with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.
(4) The Proposer shall appropriately mark all contract deliverables controlled by ITAR and/or
EAR.
(5) The Proposer shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this section
apply to its subcontractors.
(6) The Proposer may be required to certify knowledge of and intended adherence to these
requirements in the representations and certifications of the contract.
6.B.7 Subcontracting
It is the policy of the Government to enable small business and small disadvantaged business
concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering
services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts and to assure that
prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Each large business Proposer that is
selected for negotiation for award will be asked to submit a subcontracting plan before award IAW
FAR 19.702(a) (1) Statutory requirements. The plan format is outlined in FAR 19.704
Subcontracting plan requirements.
Proposers shall declare teaming relationships in their Technical and Cost proposals and shall
specify the type of teaming arrangement in place, including any exclusive teaming arrangements.
IARPA neither promotes nor discourages the establishment of exclusive teaming agreements
within Proposer teams. Individuals or organizations associated with multiple teams shall take care
not to over-commit those resources being applied.
6.B.8 Reporting
Fiscal and management responsibility are important to the Program. Although the number and
types of reportsshall be specified in the award document, all Proposersshall, at a minimum, provide
the CO, COR and PM with monthly technical reports and monthly financial reports. The reports
shall be prepared and submitted IAW the procedures contained in the award document and
mutually agreed upon before award. Technical reports shall describe technical highlights and
