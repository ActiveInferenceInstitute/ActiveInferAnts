# Grant Proposal for the Project: "Empowering Human Agency through Decentralized AI Governance"

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**: The rapid advancement of AI technologies poses a significant risk of power concentration among a select few corporations and individuals, threatening individual agency, democratic governance, and societal equity. Our project seeks to address this challenge by developing frameworks for decentralized AI governance that prioritize public accountability and individual empowerment.

**Project Purpose**: This initiative aims to create a model for "Public AI" systems that operate outside traditional corporate structures, ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed with greater public control and accountability.

**Inspiration**: The project was inspired by the recognition that current AI developments often prioritize profit maximization over societal well-being, leading to a concentration of power that undermines democratic values and individual autonomy.

**Alignment with Mission**: Our organization is committed to fostering a philosophical understanding of technology that emphasizes relational autonomy, care ethics, and the democratization of knowledge. This project aligns with our mission to ensure that technological advancements benefit all members of society rather than a privileged few.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
- **Objective 1**: Develop a comprehensive framework for decentralized AI governance.
  - **Key Result 1**: Publish a detailed report outlining governance structures by Q2 2025.
- **Objective 2**: Engage stakeholders in the co-design of Public AI systems.
  - **Key Result 2**: Conduct three workshops with diverse community groups by Q3 2025.
- **Objective 3**: Assess the impact of decentralized AI governance on public agency.
  - **Key Result 3**: Measure changes in public perception of AI governance through surveys by Q4 2025.

**Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will contribute to the field by providing a novel approach to AI governance that integrates philosophical insights with practical applications, challenging existing paradigms of power concentration.
