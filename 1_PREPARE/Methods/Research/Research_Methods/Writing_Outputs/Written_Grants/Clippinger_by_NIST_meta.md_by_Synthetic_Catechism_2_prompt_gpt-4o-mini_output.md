# Grant Proposal for NIST: Advancing Natural AI and Decentralized Governance

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and decentralized technologies presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges. Traditional governance structures and economic models are ill-equipped to address the complexities of these advancements, leading to issues of trust, transparency, and equity.

**Project Purpose**: Our project aims to develop a framework for Natural AI and decentralized governance systems that prioritize human values, enhance individual agency, and promote sustainable economic practices.

**Inspiration**: The initiative was inspired by the transformative potential of Carl Friston's work on active inference, which provides a principled way of understanding intelligence and behavior. This project seeks to apply these insights to create a more adaptive and participatory governance model.

**Alignment with Mission**: This initiative aligns with NIST's mission to advance measurement science and technology, as it focuses on developing standards for AI and decentralized governance that enhance economic security and improve quality of life.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
- Develop a Natural AI framework that incorporates active inference principles.
- Create a prototype decentralized governance model that enhances participatory decision-making.
- Measure the impact of these systems on community engagement and economic sustainability.

**Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will advance knowledge in AI, governance, and economic models by providing a novel framework that integrates insights from complexity science and social sciences.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis
