# Grant Proposal for the National Science Foundation (NSF)

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**: Our project addresses the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the interplay between technology, cognition, and ethics in contemporary society. As artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies increasingly shape human experiences, there is a critical gap in frameworks that integrate philosophical insights with practical applications in technology ethics and cognitive science.

**Project Purpose**: We aim to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates care ethics, embodied cognition, and relational autonomy into the design and implementation of AI systems. This framework will guide ethical decision-making and enhance the human-technology relationship.

**Inspiration**: The project was inspired by the growing recognition of the ethical implications of AI and the need for a philosophical foundation that emphasizes care and relationality in technology development.

**Alignment with Mission**: This initiative aligns with our mission to foster interdisciplinary research that bridges philosophy and technology, promoting ethical practices in scientific and technological advancements.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
1. Develop a theoretical framework for care ethics in AI by Q2 2025.
2. Conduct pilot studies with stakeholders in technology development by Q4 2025.
3. Publish findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at major conferences by Q1 2026.

**Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will advance knowledge in the fields of philosophy of technology and AI ethics by providing a novel, interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes the importance of relational autonomy and care in technological development.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**Current State of the Art**: The current discourse on AI ethics often focuses on issues of bias, transparency, and accountability. However, there is a lack of frameworks that consider the relational and embodied aspects of human-technology interactions.

**Key Players**: Key players include academic institutions, tech companies, and think tanks focused on AI ethics, such as the Partnership on AI and the Future of Life Institute.

**Limitations or Gaps**: Existing solutions often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, neglecting the nuanced, context-dependent nature of ethical considerations in technology.

**Regulatory Considerations**: The evolving landscape of AI regulations, such as the EU's AI Act, necessitates frameworks that can adapt to legal and ethical standards.
