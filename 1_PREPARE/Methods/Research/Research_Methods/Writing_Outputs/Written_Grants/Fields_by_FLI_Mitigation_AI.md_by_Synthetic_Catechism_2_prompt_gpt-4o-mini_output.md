# Grant Proposal: Empowering Human Agency through Decentralized AI Governance

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem**: The rapid advancement of AI technologies is leading to a concentration of power among a few corporations and governments, threatening individual agency and democratic processes. Our project aims to address this issue by developing a decentralized AI governance framework that empowers individuals and communities.

**Project Purpose**: We seek to create a public AI model that prioritizes human agency and accountability, ensuring that AI systems serve the interests of the many rather than the few. This initiative is inspired by the need to combat the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities and diminish democratic participation.

**Alignment with Mission**: Our project aligns with the mission of the Future of Life Institute (FLI) by steering transformative technology towards benefiting life and mitigating risks associated with AI-driven power concentration. 

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
1. Develop a prototype of a decentralized AI governance model within 12 months.
2. Engage at least 500 stakeholders in co-designing the framework.
3. Publish a comprehensive report evaluating the effectiveness of the model in promoting human agency.

**Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will advance knowledge in AI governance by providing a novel framework that integrates insights from information theory, cognitive science, and social justice, challenging existing paradigms of AI development.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art**: Currently, AI governance is dominated by corporate interests, with limited public accountability. Existing frameworks often fail to address the nuances of power dynamics and the importance of human agency.

**Key Players**: Major tech corporations (e.g., Google, Amazon) and governmental bodies are the primary players in AI development. Thought leaders include researchers in AI ethics and governance, such as Kate Crawford and Timnit Gebru.

**Limitations**: Current solutions often lack transparency and fail to engage the public meaningfully. Many frameworks do not consider the complexities of observer-dependent reality and the role of context in shaping AI systems.

**Regulatory Considerations**: There are growing calls for regulation to prevent monopolistic practices in AI, but existing laws often lag behind technological advancements.

**Relevance**: Recent societal shifts, including increased scrutiny of corporate power and a demand for greater accountability, make this project timely and relevant.

## 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novelty**: Our approach is groundbreaking in its integration of information-theoretic principles with decentralized governance models, emphasizing the role of human agency in AI systems.

**Differentiation**: Unlike existing frameworks, our model prioritizes public control and accountability, ensuring that AI systems are designed to serve individuals rather than corporations.

**Methodologies**:
- **Active Inference**: We will employ active inference as a framework for understanding how individuals can interact with AI systems to shape their outcomes.
- **Information Theory**: This will guide our understanding of how information flows within AI systems and its implications for power dynamics.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: We will engage experts from cognitive science, law, and social justice to co-design the governance framework.

**Preliminary Work**: Initial workshops with stakeholders have indicated strong interest in a governance model that prioritizes human agency.

**Scalability**: The proposed framework is designed to be adaptable across different contexts and scalable to various AI applications.

## 4. Impact and Significance Assessment

**Beneficiaries**: The primary beneficiaries include individuals and communities who currently lack agency in AI systems, particularly marginalized groups.

**Quantifiable Impact**:
- Short-term: Development of a prototype governance model.
- Medium-term: Increased public engagement in AI governance.
- Long-term: Enhanced individual agency and reduced power concentration.

**Contribution to Long-term Goals**: This project addresses grand challenges in AI governance, promoting a more equitable distribution of power and resources.

**Unintended Consequences**: Potential challenges include resistance from established corporations and the need for public education on the governance model.

**Evaluation of Success**: We will measure success through stakeholder engagement metrics, feedback on the prototype, and assessments of public awareness.

**Paradigm Shifts**: This project has the potential to redefine how AI governance is approached, emphasizing decentralization and human agency.
