# Grant Proposal to the Future of Life Institute (FLI)

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to an unprecedented concentration of power among a select few corporations and individuals. This concentration threatens individual agency, democratic governance, and equitable economic opportunities. Our project seeks to address this critical issue by developing a framework for "Public AI" that emphasizes decentralization, individual empowerment, and community-driven governance.

**Project Purpose**  
Our initiative aims to create a robust model for public AI systems that prioritize transparency, accountability, and user control. By leveraging decentralized technologies and principles of active inference, we will design AI systems that serve the public good rather than corporate interests.

**Inspiration**  
The project was inspired by the urgent need to counteract the monopolistic tendencies of current AI developments and the potential for AI to enhance human agency rather than diminish it. Our work is rooted in the belief that AI can be a transformative force for good when developed with the right principles.

**Alignment with Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to rethink institutional design and governance, ensuring that technological advancements empower individuals and communities. Our commitment to life-centric economics and decentralized governance underpins our approach to this project.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a prototype for a public AI system that incorporates decentralized governance structures by Year 1.
2. Engage at least 500 community stakeholders in the design and evaluation process by Year 2.
3. Publish a comprehensive report on the effectiveness of public AI in mitigating power concentration by Year 3.

**Advancement of Knowledge**  
This project will contribute to the field by providing a scalable model for public AI, demonstrating how decentralized systems can effectively counteract the concentration of power in AI development.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art**  
Currently, AI development is dominated by a handful of tech giants, leading to concerns about monopolistic practices and the erosion of individual rights. The existing solutions often lack transparency and accountability, resulting in a significant gap between technological capabilities and ethical governance.

**Key Players**  
Key players include major tech corporations, regulatory bodies, and academic institutions. Thought leaders in the field advocate for open-source AI, yet many of these initiatives still favor those with substantial resources.

**Limitations and Gaps**  
Existing solutions often fail to address the ethical implications of AI deployment, particularly regarding privacy, bias, and accountability. There is a lack of frameworks that empower individuals and communities in the governance of AI technologies.

**Regulatory Considerations**  
The project will navigate complex regulatory landscapes, ensuring compliance with existing laws while advocating for new frameworks that promote public accountability in AI development.

**Relevance of Recent Advancements**  
The increasing awareness of AI's societal implications and the push for ethical AI development make this project timely. The rise of decentralized technologies offers new avenues for creating equitable AI systems.

**Fit into Current Paradigms**  
Our project challenges the prevailing paradigm of corporate-controlled AI by proposing a model that emphasizes public ownership and community governance.

## 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novelty of Approach**  
Our approach is groundbreaking in its emphasis on public AI systems that prioritize individual agency and community involvement. By integrating principles of active inference and decentralized governance, we aim to create AI systems that are both effective and ethically sound.

**Differentiation from Existing Alternatives**  
Unlike existing AI systems that prioritize profit maximization, our model focuses on benefit distribution and community empowerment. This shift in focus is crucial for mitigating power concentration.

**Technologies and Methodologies**  
We will employ blockchain technology for transparency and accountability, active inference for adaptive learning, and participatory design methodologies to engage stakeholders throughout the project.

**Preliminary Experiments**  
Initial pilot studies have demonstrated the feasibility of decentralized governance models in AI systems, highlighting their potential for enhancing user control and accountability.

**Scalability and Adaptability**  
The proposed solution is designed to be scalable across various contexts, allowing for adaptation to different community needs and technological environments.

**Interdisciplinary Collaborations**  
We will collaborate with experts in social sciences, technology, and governance to ensure a holistic approach to public AI development.

## 4. Impact and Significance Assessment

**Primary Beneficiaries**  
The primary beneficiaries include individuals and communities who will gain greater control over AI technologies that affect their lives. Additionally, policymakers and organizations advocating for ethical AI will benefit from our findings.

**Quantifiable Impact**
