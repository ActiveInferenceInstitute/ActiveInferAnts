## Situation
The intelligence community is currently facing a challenge in enhancing the quality of argumentation in their analytic reports. The traditional methods used to address this issue, such as structured analytic techniques, are time-consuming and not widely used. If not addressed, the quality of intelligence reports may suffer, leading to potential inaccuracies and inefficiencies in intelligence operations.

## Mission
The mission of this project is to develop an innovative technology that will enable intelligence analysts to substantially increase the quality of argumentation in their analytic reports through more effective use of evidence and reasoning.

## Potential Avenues of Approach
We propose to apply Friston's Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework to develop a technology that will automatically produce comments on a draft report, highlighting additional relevant evidence, and identify strengths and weaknesses in the draftâ€™s reasoning. 

This approach requires expertise in computational neuroscience, information theory, and variational methods. The risks include the complexity of the task and the need for extensive testing and validation. The potential limitations are the inherent uncertainties in any predictive model and the need for continuous refinement and updating of the model.

## Milestones
1. Development of a prototype technology based on Friston's principles
2. Testing and validation of the prototype
3. Integration of the technology into the intelligence analysts' workflow
4. Evaluation of the impact of the technology on the quality of analytic reports

## Implications of Outcome
Success in this project means that intelligence analysts will be able to produce higher quality reports, leading to more accurate and efficient intelligence operations. The team members will gain valuable experience in applying advanced computational models to practical problems. The successful technology could also be applied to other areas such as business analytics and scientific research.

## Administration, Logistics, and Communications
The facilitator responsible for the project's completion is Karl Friston. The team is accountable to the U.S. Army Research Office and IARPA. The project requires resources such as computational facilities and access to relevant databases. The requirements for participation include expertise in computational neuroscience and information theory. The group will communicate through regular online meetings and email updates. The work will be done remotely with regular progress reports. The project will close when the technology has been successfully integrated into the intelligence analysts' workflow. The current collaborators include a team of researchers with expertise in Friston's principles and computational models.

In response to the IARPA REASON Program, we propose to address all three technical Task Areas (TAs) using Friston's Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework. We believe that this innovative approach will significantly enhance the quality of argumentation in intelligence analysts' reports.
