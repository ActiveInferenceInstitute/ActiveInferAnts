# Grant Proposal for the NIST Baldrige Performance Excellence Program

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**: The project addresses the critical need for organizations to enhance their performance and resilience in an increasingly complex and uncertain environment. By applying the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference, we aim to create a framework that helps organizations minimize surprise and optimize their operational effectiveness.

**Project Purpose**: Our project seeks to develop a comprehensive model that integrates the Baldrige Excellence Framework with advanced cognitive neuroscience principles, enabling organizations to achieve sustained performance excellence through continuous learning and adaptation.

**Inspiration**: The inspiration for this project stems from the recognition that traditional performance management frameworks often overlook the cognitive and adaptive processes that underpin organizational behavior. By integrating insights from neuroscience, we can foster a deeper understanding of how organizations can self-organize and adapt to their environments.

**Alignment with Mission**: This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in cognitive science and its application to organizational behavior, promoting a culture of continuous improvement and resilience.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
- Objective 1: Develop a model integrating cognitive neuroscience principles with the Baldrige framework.
  - Key Result 1: Complete model development by Q2 2025.
- Objective 2: Pilot the model in three diverse organizations.
  - Key Result 2: Achieve a 20% improvement in performance metrics within one year of implementation.
- Objective 3: Disseminate findings through workshops and publications.
  - Key Result 3: Conduct three workshops and publish two peer-reviewed articles by Q4 2026.

**Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will advance knowledge by bridging the gap between cognitive neuroscience and organizational performance management, providing a novel perspective on how organizations can leverage cognitive principles for enhanced effectiveness.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis
