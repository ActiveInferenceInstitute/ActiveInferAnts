  2. Conduct pilot studies in three organizations to assess the framework's impact on decision-making and learning by Q4 2025.
  3. Achieve a 20% improvement in stakeholder engagement metrics in participating organizations by Q3 2026.

- **Advancing Knowledge**: This project will contribute to the field by providing a novel application of theoretical frameworks in practical settings, enhancing understanding of complex systems in organizational contexts.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis
- **State of the Art**: Current performance management frameworks often lack integration across disciplines, focusing on isolated metrics rather than holistic improvement. The Baldrige Excellence Framework is a leading model, yet it requires adaptation to incorporate insights from complex systems and active inference.

- **Key Players**: Major players include organizations that have received the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, as well as thought leaders in systems theory and computational psychiatry.

- **Limitations/Gaps**: Existing frameworks do not adequately address the dynamic and non-linear nature of organizational systems. There is a gap in methodologies that incorporate probabilistic approaches and contextual dependencies.

- **Regulatory Considerations**: Ethical considerations around data privacy and informed consent in healthcare settings will be paramount, as we will be working with sensitive information.

- **Technological Advancements**: The rise of AI and machine learning technologies presents an opportunity to enhance our framework, allowing for real-time data analysis and feedback loops.

- **Project Fit**: Our project challenges the current paradigms by advocating for a systems-based approach that recognizes the interdependencies within organizations, aligning with the Baldrige Program's emphasis on comprehensive management.

### 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach
