# Grant Proposal for Mitigating AI-Driven Power Concentration

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to an alarming concentration of power among a select few corporations and individuals. This concentration threatens democratic values, economic freedom, and individual agency. Our project seeks to address this issue by developing a framework for "Public AI," which emphasizes public control, accountability, and equitable access to AI technologies.

**Project Purpose:**  
Our initiative aims to create a model for a decentralized AI governance system that empowers individuals and communities, ensuring that AI technologies serve the collective good rather than the interests of a few.

**Inspiration:**  
The project was inspired by the growing concerns over AI's role in shaping societal structures and the need for a paradigm shift towards inclusive and participatory AI development.

**Alignment with Mission:**  
This project aligns with our mission at Versus Research Lab and our affiliations with Jewish General Hospital and McGill University to advance integrated science and promote human agency through innovative research. We aim to unify insights from active inference, complex systems, and computational psychiatry to create a holistic approach to AI governance.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**  
1. Develop a comprehensive framework for Public AI governance by the end of Year 1.
2. Engage at least 500 stakeholders in discussions and workshops on AI accountability and public control.
3. Pilot a Public AI prototype that demonstrates effective community engagement and resource distribution by Year 3.

**Advancement of Knowledge:**  
This initiative will advance knowledge in the fields of AI ethics, governance, and social cognition by providing a structured approach to decentralizing AI power, ultimately contributing to a more equitable technological landscape.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**Current State of the Art:**  
The current landscape is dominated by a few tech giants that control significant AI resources and capabilities. Existing governance frameworks often lack transparency and accountability, leading to a disconnect between AI development and societal needs.

**Key Players and Thought Leaders:**  
Key players include major tech corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, alongside emerging AI startups. Thought leaders in AI ethics, such as Kate Crawford and Timnit Gebru, are advocating for more equitable AI practices.

**Limitations and Gaps:**  
Current solutions often fail to address the systemic issues of power concentration and lack mechanisms for public accountability. There is a notable absence of frameworks that prioritize community engagement and equitable resource distribution.

**Regulatory Considerations:**  
Regulatory frameworks are still evolving, and there is a pressing need for policies that ensure AI technologies are developed with public oversight and benefit.

**Technological Advancements:**  
Recent advancements in AI capabilities, particularly in generative models and machine learning, highlight the urgency of creating governance structures that prevent monopolistic control.

**Project Fit:**  
Our project challenges the prevailing paradigms of AI governance by advocating for a model that emphasizes public participation and accountability, directly addressing the issues of power concentration highlighted by FLI.

## 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novel Approach:**  
Our approach is groundbreaking in its focus on "Public AI" as a governance model that integrates community input and prioritizes equitable access to AI technologies.

**Differentiation from Alternatives:**  
Unlike existing models that reinforce corporate control, our framework emphasizes decentralized governance, ensuring that AI systems are accountable to the public and aligned with societal needs.

**Technologies and Methodologies:**  
We will employ methodologies such as active inference and information geometry to model the dynamics of AI governance. Our approach will also incorporate participatory design principles to engage stakeholders in the development process.

**Preliminary Studies:**  
We have conducted initial workshops with community stakeholders, revealing a strong interest in participatory AI governance and the need for frameworks that prioritize public accountability.

**Scalability and Adaptability:**  
The proposed framework is designed to be scalable, with the potential for adaptation across various communities and contexts, ensuring broad applicability.

**Interdisciplinary Collaborations:**  
We will collaborate with experts in computational psychiatry, social cognition, and AI ethics to develop a comprehensive understanding of the implications of AI governance.
