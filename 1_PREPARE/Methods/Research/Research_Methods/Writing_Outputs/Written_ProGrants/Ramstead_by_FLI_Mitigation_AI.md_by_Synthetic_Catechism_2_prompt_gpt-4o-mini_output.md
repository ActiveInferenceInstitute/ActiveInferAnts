# Grant Proposal: Empowering Human Agency Through Decentralized AI Governance

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

### Core Problem and Opportunity
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to an alarming concentration of power among a select few corporations and individuals. This trend threatens individual agency, democratic processes, and equitable access to resources. Our project addresses this issue by proposing a framework for decentralized AI governance that prioritizes public accountability and individual empowerment.

### Project Purpose
Our initiative aims to develop a public AI model that is governed by community stakeholders rather than corporate interests. This model will ensure that AI technologies serve the public good, fostering transparency, inclusivity, and fairness in their deployment.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project stems from the recognition that existing AI systems often exacerbate social inequalities and concentrate decision-making power. By leveraging insights from active inference and the Free Energy Principle, we aim to create a system that aligns AI development with human values and collective well-being.

### Alignment with Mission
This project aligns with our mission at Versus Research Lab, Jewish General Hospital, and McGill University to advance knowledge in computational psychiatry and complex systems. We are committed to integrating scientific research with societal needs, ensuring that AI technologies enhance human agency rather than diminish it.

### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
1. **Objective**: Develop a prototype for a decentralized AI governance model.
   - **Key Result**: Complete a comprehensive design specification by Q2 2025.
2. **Objective**: Engage community stakeholders in the governance process.
   - **Key Result**: Establish a stakeholder advisory board by Q3 2025.
3. **Objective**: Evaluate the impact of the public AI model on community engagement.
   - **Key Result**: Conduct a pilot study with at least 100 participants by Q4 2025.

### Advancement of Knowledge
This initiative will advance knowledge in the fields of AI governance, active inference, and public accountability. By integrating theoretical frameworks with practical applications, we aim to provide a blueprint for future AI systems that prioritize human agency.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

### State of the Art
The current landscape of AI governance is dominated by corporate interests, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability. Existing models often prioritize profit maximization over public welfare, resulting in significant societal risks.

### Key Players and Competitors
Key players in this field include major tech corporations like Google and Facebook, which have significant control over AI technologies. However, there is a growing movement among researchers and non-profits advocating for ethical AI practices.

### Limitations and Gaps
Current solutions often fail to address the complexities of power dynamics in AI governance. There is a lack of frameworks that genuinely empower communities and ensure equitable access to AI technologies.

### Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
The project will adhere to ethical guidelines surrounding data privacy and security. We will engage with relevant oversight committees to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

### Recent Advancements
The rise of open-source AI initiatives and public discourse around ethical AI practices make this project timely. There is a growing recognition of the need for decentralized governance models that prioritize public interests.

### Fit with Current Paradigms
Our project challenges the prevailing corporate-centric paradigms by advocating for a model that emphasizes community control and accountability in AI development.

## 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

### Novelty of Approach
Our approach is groundbreaking in that it combines principles of active inference with decentralized governance structures. This integration allows for a more responsive and adaptive AI system that aligns with human needs.

### Improvement Over Existing Alternatives
Unlike existing models that prioritize corporate interests, our public AI model will be governed by community stakeholders, ensuring that decisions reflect collective values and priorities.

### Technologies and Frameworks
We will utilize methodologies such as active inference, variational inference, and Markov blanket formalism to design our AI governance model. These frameworks will enable us to create a system that is both adaptive and accountable.

### Preliminary Studies
Preliminary research has indicated that community-driven governance can enhance trust and engagement in AI systems. Our pilot studies will build on these findings to develop a robust governance framework.

### Scalability and Adaptability
The proposed model is designed to be scalable, allowing for adaptation to various community contexts. This flexibility ensures that the governance structure can evolve with changing societal needs.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
We will collaborate with experts in computational psychiatry, social sciences, and AI ethics to ensure a comprehensive approach to governance that considers multiple perspectives.
