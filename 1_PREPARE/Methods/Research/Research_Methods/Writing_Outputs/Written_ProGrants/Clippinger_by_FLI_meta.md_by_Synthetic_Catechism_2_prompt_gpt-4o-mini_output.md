# Grant Proposal for the Future of Life Institute

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**
Our project addresses the urgent need for a paradigm shift in how we approach artificial intelligence (AI) and governance, particularly in the context of ensuring that these technologies benefit humanity and mitigate existential risks. The rapid advancement of AI presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant threats, necessitating a rethinking of institutional frameworks and ethical considerations.

**Project Purpose:**
We aim to develop a framework for "Natural AI," grounded in principles of biological intelligence and active inference, which will enable the creation of AI systems that are robust, ethical, and aligned with human values. This initiative seeks to foster decentralized governance models that empower individuals and communities, thereby enhancing societal resilience.

**Inspiration:**
The project was inspired by the recognition that current institutional structures are inadequate to address the complexities of modern challenges, as highlighted by my work with various institutions such as the MIT Media Lab and the Active Inference Institute. The transformative potential of Carl Friston's work on active inference has been a guiding influence, emphasizing the need for a principled approach to AI development.

**Alignment with Mission:**
This initiative aligns with the Future of Life Institute's mission to steer transformative technologies towards benefiting life. By focusing on AI safety, ethical governance, and decentralized systems, we aim to contribute to the broader goals of mitigating risks associated with advanced AI and promoting pro-social platforms.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**
1. Develop a comprehensive framework for Natural AI that incorporates active inference principles.
   - Key Result: Publish a white paper outlining the framework within 12 months.
2. Establish partnerships with at least five organizations focused on AI governance and ethics.
   - Key Result: Host a collaborative workshop with partners within 18 months.
3. Create a pilot program for decentralized governance models in at least two communities.
   - Key Result: Implement and evaluate the pilot programs within 24 months.

**Advancement of Knowledge:**
This project will advance knowledge in the fields of AI, governance, and complexity science by providing a novel framework that integrates insights from these disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art:**
The current landscape in AI governance is characterized by a lack of cohesive frameworks that address ethical considerations and the societal implications of AI technologies. Existing approaches often focus on technical solutions without adequately considering the broader social context.

**Key Players:**
Key players include organizations like the Future of Life Institute, OpenAI, and various academic institutions engaged in AI ethics and governance. However, many of these efforts remain fragmented and lack integration with decentralized governance models.

**Limitations or Gaps:**
Current solutions often fail to address the scalability and adaptability required for modern governance challenges. There is also a significant gap in understanding how to effectively implement decentralized systems that empower individuals.

**Regulatory Considerations:**
Regulatory frameworks around AI are still evolving, with significant attention on data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. Our project will navigate these considerations by emphasizing transparency and participatory decision-making.

**Technological Advancements:**
Recent advancements in blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provide a timely opportunity to explore new governance models that align with the principles of Natural AI.

**Project Fit:**
Our project challenges current paradigms by proposing a shift from centralized to decentralized governance, emphasizing the importance of individual agency and community empowerment in the age of AI.
