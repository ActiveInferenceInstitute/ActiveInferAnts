# Grant Proposal for "Empowering Human Agency through Decentralized AI Systems"

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to concentrate power in the hands of a few corporations and governments, leading to a potential erosion of individual agency and democratic processes. Our project addresses this pressing issue by proposing a framework for decentralized AI systems that prioritize public accountability and individual empowerment.

**Succinct Articulation**  
We aim to develop a decentralized AI architecture that operates transparently and is governed by community input, ensuring that AI technologies serve the public good rather than corporate interests.

**Inspiration**  
This initiative was inspired by the growing concern over AI's role in societal power dynamics, particularly as seen in recent events where misinformation and surveillance have undermined democratic institutions. Our commitment to mathematical rigor and statistical integrity drives us to seek solutions that promote equitable AI deployment.

**Alignment with Mission**  
Our organization, rooted in the principles of mathematical rigor and ethical inquiry, aligns with the Future of Life Institute's mission to steer transformative technology towards benefiting life. By advocating for decentralized governance of AI, we aim to foster a society where technology enhances human agency and democratic participation.
