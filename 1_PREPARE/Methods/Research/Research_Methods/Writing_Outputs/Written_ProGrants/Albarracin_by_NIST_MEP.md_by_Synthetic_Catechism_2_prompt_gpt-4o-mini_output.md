# Grant Proposal for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP)

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**: The project addresses the critical challenge of misinformation and its impact on decision-making within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector. In an era where rapid information flow can lead to epistemic vulnerability, it is essential to enhance the cognitive resilience of these organizations.

**Project Purpose**: This initiative aims to develop a framework that integrates cognitive science principles, particularly those related to cultural cognition and active inference, to improve decision-making processes in SMEs. By leveraging these insights, we can foster a culture of informed decision-making that minimizes the risks associated with misinformation.

**Inspiration**: The project was inspired by the increasing prevalence of misinformation in digital environments and its detrimental effects on organizational performance. The need for a robust framework that combines cognitive science with practical applications in manufacturing became evident.

**Alignment with Mission**: This initiative aligns with our mission to enhance the cognitive capabilities of organizations, ensuring they can navigate complex information landscapes effectively. It supports the MEPâ€™s objectives of strengthening U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and promoting innovation.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
