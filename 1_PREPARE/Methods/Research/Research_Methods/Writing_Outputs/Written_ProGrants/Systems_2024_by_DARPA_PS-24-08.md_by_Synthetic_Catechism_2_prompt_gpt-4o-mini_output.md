# Grant Proposal for DARPA's Rubble to Rockets (R2) Program

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
The R2 program addresses the critical challenge of producing essential structures using locally available materials in contested logistics environments. Current manufacturing paradigms are rigid, relying on pristine materials and fixed designs, which limits adaptability in dynamic operational contexts. Our project aims to revolutionize this paradigm by developing a flexible, deployable manufacturing platform that utilizes diverse, scavenged feedstock materials to create structural components, such as sounding rockets.

**Project Purpose**  
Our initiative seeks to enable the adaptive design and manufacturing of rocket structures that can be produced on-site, thereby reducing dependency on traditional supply chains. We aim to create a system that can dynamically adjust to the variability of available materials, ensuring that military operations are not hindered by logistical constraints.

**Inspiration for the Project**  
Inspired by the principles of cybernetics and systems thinking, our project is rooted in the understanding that language and action shape our perception and capabilities. The need for innovative manufacturing solutions in defense contexts, particularly in light of recent geopolitical developments, has galvanized our commitment to this initiative.

**Alignment with Organizational Mission**  
This project aligns with our mission to advance systems science and technology for societal benefit. By integrating concepts such as systems responsibility and sustainability, we aim to contribute to the resilience and adaptability of military operations while fostering interdisciplinary conversations that bridge technology and society.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a flexible manufacturing platform capable of processing diverse scavenged materials with a production rate of 0.1 m³/day.
2. Create an adaptive design framework that can update rocket designs in under one hour based on material properties.
3. Validate the system through iterative design trials and pressure testing of produced components, achieving a minimum range of 35 km for the sounding rocket.

**Advancement of Knowledge and Practice**  
This project will advance knowledge in material informatics and adaptive design methodologies, contributing to the broader field of systems science. By demonstrating the feasibility of using variable materials in structural applications, we will challenge existing paradigms and inspire further research and development in this area.
