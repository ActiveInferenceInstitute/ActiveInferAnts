# Grant Proposal for the Friston Worldview Project

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity Addressed:**
The Friston Worldview Project seeks to address the fundamental challenges in understanding cognition, consciousness, and decision-making through the lens of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science, providing a comprehensive framework for modeling intelligent behavior in both biological and artificial systems.

**Project Purpose:**
Our project aims to develop a robust theoretical framework and practical applications based on the FEP, which posits that all self-organizing systems minimize free energy to maintain homeostasis. By articulating this principle in accessible terms, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of cognitive processes and their implications for artificial intelligence.

**Inspiration for the Project:**
The project was inspired by the need to unify disparate theories of cognition and consciousness under a coherent framework that can be empirically tested and applied. The increasing complexity of AI systems and the challenges in understanding human cognition necessitate a fresh perspective that integrates insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and computational modeling.

**Alignment with Organizational Mission:**
This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. Our values of curiosity, rigor, and ethical responsibility guide our approach, ensuring that our work contributes positively to society.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**
- **Objective 1:** Develop a comprehensive theoretical framework based on the FEP.
  - **Key Result 1:** Publish three peer-reviewed articles in leading journals within two years.
