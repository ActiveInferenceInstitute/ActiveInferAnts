# Grant Proposal for the NIST Baldrige Performance Excellence Program

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision
- **Core Problem/Opportunity**: Our project addresses the fundamental need to enhance organizational effectiveness and resilience through an information-theoretic framework that integrates cognitive science with performance excellence. By understanding organizations as complex adaptive systems, we can improve decision-making processes, stakeholder engagement, and overall performance.
  
- **Purpose**: The project aims to develop a comprehensive model that applies principles of information realism, active inference, and the free energy principle to organizational management, enabling organizations to thrive in a rapidly changing environment.

- **Inspiration**: The project was inspired by the recognition that traditional management approaches often overlook the role of information and cognition in shaping organizational reality. The integration of cognitive science with performance excellence offers a novel pathway to enhance organizational resilience.

- **Alignment with Mission**: This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in cognitive science and its applications to real-world challenges, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and interdisciplinary collaboration.

- **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**:
  1. Develop a framework for integrating cognitive science principles into organizational management by Q2 2025.
  2. Pilot the framework in three diverse organizations by Q4 2025, aiming for a 20% improvement in stakeholder engagement metrics.
  3. Publish findings in a peer-reviewed journal by Q1 2026, contributing to the body of knowledge on performance excellence.

- **Advancement of Knowledge**: This project will advance knowledge by demonstrating how cognitive processes influence organizational performance, thereby providing a new lens through which to view management practices.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis
- **State of the Art**: The current landscape of organizational management emphasizes performance metrics and operational efficiency but often neglects the cognitive and informational aspects that underpin decision-making.
