# Grant Proposal for the Future of Life Institute

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**  
The project addresses the urgent need for sustainable solutions to global challenges exacerbated by rapid technological advancement, particularly in the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and environmental degradation. We aim to harness the principles of R. Buckminster Fuller to create a framework for anticipatory design that mitigates risks associated with these technologies while promoting life-affirming practices.

**Project Purpose:**  
Our initiative seeks to develop a comprehensive anticipatory design science framework that integrates Fuller's principles of synergetics, ephemeralization, and livingry to create sustainable technological solutions. This framework will guide the development of AI systems that prioritize human well-being and environmental sustainability.

**Inspiration for the Project:**  
Inspired by Fuller's vision of "Spaceship Earth," this project was initiated in response to the growing concerns surrounding AI's impact on society and the environment. The need for a holistic approach to design that respects the planet's finite resources and promotes cooperation over competition is more pressing than ever.

**Alignment with Organizational Mission:**  
This initiative aligns with the Future of Life Institute's mission to steer transformative technologies towards benefiting life. By focusing on anticipatory design and sustainable practices, we aim to contribute to FLI’s objectives of mitigating risks associated with advanced AI and promoting global cooperation.
