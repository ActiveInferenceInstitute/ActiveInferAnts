# Grant Proposal for the John Templeton Foundation

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
Our project addresses the urgent challenge of insect decline, which poses significant threats to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human flourishing. Insects are vital for pollination, nutrient cycling, and food security, yet they are experiencing unprecedented declines due to climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use. This project seeks to explore innovative solutions for insect conservation and management, thereby enhancing our understanding of their role in ecosystems and promoting sustainable practices.

**Project Purpose**  
The purpose of this project is to develop an interdisciplinary framework that integrates entomological research with community engagement and policy advocacy to foster insect conservation. We aim to create a comprehensive approach that not only addresses the decline of insect populations but also promotes the intrinsic value of insects in our ecosystems.

**Inspiration for the Project**  
The inspiration for this project stems from the alarming reports of insect population declines globally and the recognition of their critical role in maintaining ecological balance. Our commitment to biodiversity conservation and the ethical responsibility to protect these organisms motivates us to take action.

**Alignment with Organization's Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in entomology and promote sustainable practices that benefit both ecosystems and human communities. By integrating scientific research with ethical considerations and community engagement, we embody the values of stewardship and responsibility.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. **Objective:** Increase public awareness of insect conservation.  
   - **Key Result:** Engage 5,000 community members through workshops and outreach programs.
2. **Objective:** Develop innovative conservation strategies.  
   - **Key Result:** Publish three peer-reviewed articles on integrated pest management and insect conservation.
3. **Objective:** Foster interdisciplinary collaboration.  
   - **Key Result:** Establish partnerships with at least five organizations across different sectors.

**Advancement of Knowledge and Practice**  
This project will advance knowledge by integrating entomological research with social sciences, exploring the intersection of human behavior and insect conservation. Our findings will contribute to the broader discourse on biodiversity and ecosystem services, aligning with the Foundation's focus on exploring life's big questions.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis
