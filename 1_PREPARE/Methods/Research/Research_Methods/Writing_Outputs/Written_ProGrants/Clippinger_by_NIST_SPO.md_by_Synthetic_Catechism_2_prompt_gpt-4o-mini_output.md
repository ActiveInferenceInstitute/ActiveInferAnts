## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity:**  
The project addresses the urgent need for innovative solutions in governance and economic systems that can adapt to the complexities of the 21st century. Current institutions struggle to scale and meet modern challenges, leading to inefficiencies and inequities. By leveraging natural AI principles and decentralized governance models, we aim to create a framework that enhances decision-making, promotes transparency, and fosters sustainable practices.

**Project Purpose:**  
Our initiative seeks to develop a robust, ethical AI framework based on active inference and decentralized governance models, enabling individuals to regain control over their digital identities and data. This project is not merely about technology; itâ€™s about reshaping societal structures to prioritize life-centric principles.

**Inspiration:**  
The inspiration for this project stems from the transformative work of Carl Friston on active inference, which fundamentally rethinks intelligence and cognition. This paradigm shift has the potential to revolutionize how we approach governance and economic models.

**Alignment with Mission:**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to innovate at the intersection of technology and social sciences, promoting sustainable economic practices and enhancing democratic governance. It embodies our commitment to creating public goods through open-source collaboration.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**
1. Develop a prototype for a decentralized governance model utilizing natural AI principles within 12 months.
2. Engage at least 100 stakeholders from diverse sectors (government, academia, industry) to refine and validate the model.
3. Publish findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at three major conferences within 18 months.

**Advancement of Knowledge:**  
This project will advance knowledge in the fields of AI, governance, and economics by providing a new framework for understanding and implementing decentralized systems that prioritize human values and sustainability.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art:**
