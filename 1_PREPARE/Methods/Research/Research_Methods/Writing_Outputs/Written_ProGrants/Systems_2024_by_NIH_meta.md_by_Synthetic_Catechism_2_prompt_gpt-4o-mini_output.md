# Grant Proposal for Systems2024: Advancing Systems Science through Cybernetic Languaging and Interdisciplinary Engagement

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
The project addresses the urgent need for innovative frameworks in understanding the complex interactions between technology, society, and health. With rapid technological advancements and their profound implications on public health, there is an opportunity to reimagine how we engage with systems thinking and cybernetics to foster resilience and sustainability in health systems.

**Project Purpose**  
Our project aims to explore and articulate the principles of cybernetic languaging and situational enactments to enhance systems literacy among health professionals and the broader community. By facilitating interdisciplinary conversations, we seek to bridge gaps between technology and society, ultimately promoting ethical technology design that prioritizes public health.

**Inspiration**  
Inspired by the historical evolution of cybernetics and its relevance to contemporary challenges, this initiative emerged from a recognition of the need for a holistic approach to health that integrates systems thinking. The quote, "In a complex system, the whole is more than the sum of its parts," encapsulates our vision.

**Alignment with Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to promote systems responsibility and critical thinking in education, addressing the NIH's goals of advancing biomedical research and fostering innovative research strategies. By integrating systems science into health education, we aim to contribute to the NIH's mission of enhancing health and reducing illness.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop an experimental glossary of cybernetic terms relevant to health systems by the end of Year 1.
2. Conduct a series of interactive workshops and performances, engaging at least 300 participants across various disciplines within the first two years.
3. Publish a proceedings volume documenting the findings and discussions from these engagements by Year 3.
