# Grant Proposal for NIH Funding: Advancing Active Inference in Computational Psychiatry

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity:**  
The project addresses the critical need for innovative frameworks in understanding and treating mental health disorders. Current psychiatric approaches often rely on static models that fail to account for the dynamic and complex nature of human cognition and behavior. By leveraging the principles of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle, we aim to create a more comprehensive understanding of mental health that integrates biological, psychological, and social dimensions.

**Project Purpose:**  
Our initiative seeks to develop a computational model that utilizes Active Inference to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in psychiatry. This model will facilitate personalized treatment plans that adapt to the evolving needs of patients, thereby improving outcomes and reducing the burden of mental illness.

**Inspiration:**  
The project was inspired by the increasing recognition of the limitations of traditional psychiatric models and the potential of computational approaches to offer deeper insights into mental health. The integration of Active Inference into psychiatric practice represents a paradigm shift that aligns with contemporary research in cognitive science and complex systems.

**Alignment with Mission:**  
This initiative aligns with the NIH's mission to enhance health and reduce illness by fostering innovative research strategies. Our focus on computational psychiatry directly contributes to understanding the causes and treatments of mental health disorders, supporting the NIH's goal of advancing biomedical research opportunities.
