# Grant Proposal for NSF 24-585: Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Practice (PDaSP)

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**
The project addresses the urgent need for privacy-preserving data sharing technologies that can facilitate secure, efficient, and responsible data-driven decision-making in a hyperconnected world. As data generation and collection grow exponentially, the risks associated with privacy breaches and misuse of sensitive information have escalated, necessitating innovative solutions that balance data utility with privacy protection.

**Project Purpose:**
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for privacy-preserving data sharing that leverages insights from collective behavior observed in ant colonies. By applying principles of self-organization, distributed processes, and dynamic task allocation, we will create scalable and adaptable privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) that empower data subjects to control their data while maximizing its utility.

**Inspiration:**
Inspired by the emergent behaviors of ant colonies, which thrive without central control, our project seeks to harness the power of decentralized decision-making and interaction networks to create robust privacy-preserving solutions. The ecological context of ant behavior provides a unique lens through which we can understand and innovate in the realm of data sharing.

**Alignment with Mission:**
This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in complex systems and collective behavior, emphasizing the importance of ecological context and evolutionary adaptation in shaping effective solutions. Our project embodies the principles outlined in the NSF PDaSP program, particularly the focus on applied and translational research.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**
1. Develop a prototype of a privacy-preserving data sharing framework that demonstrates effective data utility while minimizing privacy risks.
2. Conduct field tests to validate the framework's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, targeting at least three application domains (e.g., healthcare, transportation, and urban planning).
3. Publish findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at relevant conferences to disseminate knowledge and foster collaboration.

**Advancement of Knowledge:**
This project will contribute to the understanding of how decentralized, algorithmic approaches can inform the development of PETs, providing a novel perspective on privacy-preserving data sharing that challenges traditional centralized models.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**Current State of the Art:**
The field of privacy-preserving data sharing has seen advancements in techniques such as differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environments.
