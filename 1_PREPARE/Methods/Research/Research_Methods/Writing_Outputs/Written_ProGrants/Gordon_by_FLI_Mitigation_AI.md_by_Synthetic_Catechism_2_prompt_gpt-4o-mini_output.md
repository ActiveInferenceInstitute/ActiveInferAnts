# Grant Proposal for "Collective Intelligence: A Decentralized Approach to AI Governance"

## I. Project Essence and Vision

**1. Core Problem and Opportunity**
The rapid advancement of AI technology threatens to concentrate power in the hands of a few organizations, undermining individual agency and democratic governance. Our project seeks to address this issue by exploring decentralized governance models for AI systems that prioritize public control and accountability.

**2. Articulation of Purpose**
We aim to develop frameworks for decentralized AI governance that empower individuals and communities, ensuring that AI technologies serve the public good rather than corporate interests.

**3. Inspiration for the Project**
Inspired by the emergent behaviors observed in ant colonies, where collective intelligence arises from decentralized interactions, we believe similar principles can be applied to AI governance. This project is rooted in the idea that effective decision-making can emerge from local interactions without central control.

**4. Alignment with Mission and Values**
Our initiative aligns with our mission to understand and promote collective behavior in complex systems. By applying insights from biological systems to AI governance, we aim to foster a more equitable technological landscape.

**5. Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**
