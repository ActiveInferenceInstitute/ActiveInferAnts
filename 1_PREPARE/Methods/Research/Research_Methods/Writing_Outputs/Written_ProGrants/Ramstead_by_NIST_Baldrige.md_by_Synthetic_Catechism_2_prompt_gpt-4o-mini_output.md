# Grant Proposal for the NIST Baldrige Performance Excellence Program

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**  
Our project addresses the critical need for enhanced understanding and application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference within organizational frameworks. By integrating these concepts into performance management, we aim to foster a culture of continuous improvement and resilience, ultimately enhancing organizational effectiveness across sectors.

**Project Purpose:**  
We strive to develop a comprehensive framework that utilizes the principles of Active Inference to improve decision-making processes, learning mechanisms, and overall organizational performance. This initiative will empower organizations to adapt dynamically to changing environments, thereby increasing their competitiveness.

**Inspiration for the Project:**  
The inspiration for this project stems from our ongoing research at Versus Research Lab, the Jewish General Hospital, and McGill University, where we have observed the transformative potential of applying complex systems theory and the FEP to real-world organizational challenges.

**Alignment with Mission and Values:**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to unify the sciences of culture, mind, and brain through an integrated approach. Our values of innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning resonate deeply with the Baldrige Program’s objectives of promoting performance excellence and sharing best practices.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**  
1. Develop a prototype framework for integrating Active Inference into organizational performance management.
2. Conduct pilot studies in three diverse sectors (healthcare, education, and business) to evaluate the framework's effectiveness.
3. Achieve a 20% improvement in key performance indicators (KPIs) related to decision-making and adaptability within participating organizations.

**Advancement of Knowledge or Practice:**  
This project will advance knowledge in the fields of computational psychiatry, organizational behavior, and complex systems by providing empirical evidence on the efficacy of Active Inference in enhancing organizational resilience and performance.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**Current State of the Art:**  
The current landscape in organizational performance management is dominated by traditional models that often overlook the dynamic and complex nature of organizations. While frameworks like the Baldrige Excellence Framework exist, there is a gap in integrating cutting-edge theories from cognitive science and complex systems.

**Key Players and Competitors:**  
Key players include organizations recognized by the Baldrige Award, thought leaders in organizational psychology, and researchers in computational models. However, few are leveraging the FEP and Active Inference as foundational principles for performance excellence.

**Limitations or Gaps:**  
Existing solutions often fail to account for the non-linear, adaptive behaviors of organizations. There is a lack of frameworks that incorporate insights from embodied cognition and predictive processing, which are crucial for understanding organizational dynamics.

**Regulatory, Legal, or Ethical Considerations:**  
We will ensure compliance with ethical standards in research and data privacy, particularly when conducting studies involving human participants in organizational settings.

**Recent Advancements:**
