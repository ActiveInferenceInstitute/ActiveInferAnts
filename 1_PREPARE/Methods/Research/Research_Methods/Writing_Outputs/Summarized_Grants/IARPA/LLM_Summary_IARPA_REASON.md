### Summary of the IARPA REASON Program Grant Application

#### Overview

The **Rapid Explanation, Analysis, and Sourcing Online (REASON) Program** is a collaborative initiative between the U.S. Army Research Office and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). The program aims to enhance the quality of argumentation in intelligence analysis reports by developing automated technologies that assist analysts in identifying relevant evidence and evaluating reasoning strengths and weaknesses in their reports. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) outlines the funding opportunity, technical challenges, program phases, and submission requirements for interested applicants.

#### Funding Opportunity Details

- **Federal Agency**: U.S. Army Research Office
- **Announcement Type**: Full Announcement
- **Research Opportunity Number**: W911NF-23-S-0007
- **CFDA Number**: 12.431 â€“ Basic Scientific Research
- **Response Dates**: Proposals are due by May 8, 2023, with questions accepted until April 3, 2023.

#### Program Summary

The REASON Program seeks to develop technology that will automate the feedback process for intelligence analysts, allowing them to improve the quality of their reports without additional effort. The technology will provide comments on drafts, highlighting additional evidence and identifying strengths and weaknesses in reasoning. This aligns with the Intelligence Community's Analytic Standards, which emphasize the importance of evidence and reasoning in analytic reports.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives

The program is structured around three main technical task areas (TAs):

1. **Task Area 1 (TA1)**: Identify Additional Evidence
   - Develop methods to automatically find and rank additional supporting and contrary evidence relevant to a draft report.

2. **Task Area 2 (TA2)**: Identify Reasoning Strengths and Weaknesses
   - Create systems that can automatically identify and explain strengths and weaknesses in the reasoning of draft reports.

3. **Task Area 3 (TA3)**: Produce Comments to Increase Quality of Argumentation
   - Develop a software application that generates comments based on the outputs of TA1 and TA2, aimed at enhancing the argumentation quality in reports.

#### Program Phases

The REASON Program is divided into two phases over a total duration of 42 months:

- **Phase 1 (24 months)**: Focus on developing systems using unclassified data, with comprehensive testing on both unclassified and classified datasets.
- **Phase 2 (18 months)**: Refine capabilities for classified data, with further testing and evaluation.

Each phase includes multiple testing cycles, where performer systems will be evaluated on their ability to meet the objectives of each task area.

#### Program Scope and Limitations

Proposals must address the following:

- **Underlying Theory**: Clearly outline the theoretical basis for proposed strategies.
- **R&D Approach**: Describe the technical approach to meeting program metrics.
- **Technical Risks**: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
- **Software Development**: Detail the approach to software architecture and integration.

Research areas explicitly out of scope include purely automated report production, non-textual input processing, and approaches requiring access to classified information.

#### Proposal Submission Information

Proposals must be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS) and must include:

- **Volume 1**: Technical & Management Proposal (up to 35 pages).
- **Volume 2**: Cost Proposal (no page limit).

Proposals must be unclassified and adhere to specified formatting guidelines. The submission deadline is May 8, 2023.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**: Innovation and understanding of the problem.
2. **Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan**: Feasibility and clarity of milestones and metrics.
3. **Contribution to IARPA Mission**: Alignment with program goals and relevance to national security.
4. **Relevant Experience and Expertise**: Qualifications of key personnel and team capabilities.
5. **Resource Realism**: Justification of proposed resources and costs.

#### Award Administration Information

Anticipated awards will be made in the form of procurement contracts, with multiple awards expected. Funding for subsequent phases will depend on satisfactory performance and the availability of funds. The government reserves the right to negotiate with selected offerors and may conduct discussions if necessary.

#### Conclusion

The REASON Program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of intelligence analysis through innovative technological solutions. By addressing the outlined technical challenges and adhering to the submission requirements, applicants can play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of analytic reports within the Intelligence Community.
