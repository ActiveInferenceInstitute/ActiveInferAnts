### Summary of the IARPA REASON Program Grant Application

#### Overview

The **Rapid Explanation, Analysis, and Sourcing Online (REASON) Program** is a collaborative initiative between the U.S. Army Research Office and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). The program aims to enhance the quality of argumentation in intelligence analysis reports through the development of automated technologies that assist analysts in identifying relevant evidence and evaluating reasoning within their reports. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) outlines the funding opportunity, technical challenges, program phases, eligibility criteria, and submission requirements for interested applicants.

#### Funding Opportunity Details

- **Federal Agency Name**: U.S. Army Research Office
- **Funding Opportunity Title**: Rapid Explanation, Analysis, and Sourcing Online (REASON) Program
- **Research Opportunity Number**: W911NF-23-S-0007
- **Announcement Type**: Full Announcement
- **CFDA Number**: 12.431 â€“ Basic Scientific Research
- **Response Dates**: 
  - BAA Release: March 20, 2023
  - Questions Submission Deadline: April 3, 2023
  - Proposal Due Date: May 8, 2023

#### Program Summary

The REASON Program seeks to develop technology that will enable intelligence analysts to improve the quality of their analytic reports through better evidence utilization and reasoning. The technology will provide automated feedback on draft reports, highlighting additional relevant evidence and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the reasoning presented. This initiative aligns with the Intelligence Community's Analytic Standards, which emphasize the importance of sound argumentation in intelligence analysis.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives

The program is structured around three main technical Task Areas (TAs):

1. **Task Area 1 (TA1)**: Identify Additional Evidence
   - Develop methods to automatically find relevant supporting and contrary evidence not included in the draft report.
   
2. **Task Area 2 (TA2)**: Identify Reasoning Strengths and Weaknesses
   - Create technology to automatically assess the strengths and weaknesses of reasoning in draft reports.
   
3. **Task Area 3 (TA3)**: Produce Comments to Increase Quality of Argumentation
   - Develop a software application that generates comments based on the outputs from TA1 and TA2, aimed at enhancing the argumentation quality in reports.

Each offeror must propose innovative approaches to these TAs and create an integrated technology solution that meets the program's objectives.

#### Program Phases

The REASON Program is divided into two phases over a total duration of 42 months:

- **Phase 1 (24 months)**: Focus on developing systems using unclassified data, with comprehensive testing cycles to evaluate the capabilities of TA1, TA2, and TA3.
- **Phase 2 (18 months)**: Refine the developed technologies for classified data, with further testing and evaluation.

#### Eligibility Information

Eligible applicants include institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit entities. Proposals from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged, although no specific funding is allocated for their participation. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) are not eligible to submit proposals.

#### Application and Submission Information

Proposals must be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS) and must include both a technical and management proposal (Volume 1) and a cost proposal (Volume 2). The proposals should be clear, concise, and adhere to the specified formatting guidelines. 

Key submission details include:

- **Volume 1**: Technical & Management Proposal (up to 35 pages)
- **Volume 2**: Cost Proposal (no page limit)
- **Submission Deadline**: Proposals must be received by 5:00 PM EDT on May 8, 2023.

#### Proposal Review Information

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**: The uniqueness and innovation of the proposed methods.
2. **Effectiveness of Proposed Work Plan**: Feasibility and likelihood of meeting program milestones.
3. **Contribution and Relevance to IARPA Mission**: Alignment with IARPA's goals and objectives.
4. **Relevant Experience and Expertise**: Qualifications of the proposed team members.
5. **Resource Realism**: Appropriateness of the proposed resources and budget.

#### Award Administration Information

Awards will be made in the form of procurement contracts, contingent upon the availability of appropriations. The government reserves the right to select for negotiation all, some, or none of the proposals received. 

#### Conclusion

The REASON Program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of intelligence analysis through innovative technology solutions. By improving the quality of argumentation in analytic reports, the program aims to enhance the effectiveness of intelligence operations and decision-making processes. Interested applicants are encouraged to carefully review the BAA and submit their proposals by the specified deadline.
