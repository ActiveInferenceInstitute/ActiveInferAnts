### Summary of the Grant Application for the Anonymous Real-Time Speech (ARTS) Program

#### Overview

The Department of the Interior (DOI), in collaboration with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Anonymous Real-Time Speech (ARTS)" (DOI-BAA-ARTS-FY24-01). This initiative aims to develop innovative systems capable of modifying spontaneous speech in real-time to protect individual privacy. The program focuses on three primary technical areas (TAs) and is structured into two phases, with a total anticipated performance period of 36 months.

#### Program Objectives

The ARTS program's primary goal is to create algorithms that can anonymize speech effectively while maintaining its utility. The specific objectives include:

1. **Speaker De-Identification (TA1)**: Developing methods to modify speech signals so that speaker identification systems cannot recognize the speaker.
2. **Modification of Static Traits (TA2)**: Altering speech characteristics related to dialect, gender, and age, replacing them with pre-selected traits.
3. **Removal of Dynamic Traits (TA3)**: Modifying speech to eliminate features that indicate short-term emotional or psychological states.

The solutions must adhere to utility constraints, including latency, understandability, and naturalness, ensuring that the modified speech remains functional and comprehensible.

#### Program Phases

- **Phase 1 (18 months)**: Focuses on English language speech.
- **Phase 2 (18 months)**: Expands to include non-English languages, starting with Spanish.

#### Team Expertise and Collaboration

The program encourages multidisciplinary teams with expertise in various fields, including speech processing, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and software engineering. Collaboration among U.S. academic institutions and other organizations is highly encouraged to enhance the research outcomes.

#### Data and Evaluation

The government will provide speech data for development and evaluation purposes. Performers may also use external data with prior approval. The program includes a robust test and evaluation (T&E) framework to assess the effectiveness of the developed systems, with regular feedback provided to performers.

#### Metrics for Success

The ARTS program outlines specific metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions:

- **TA1 Metrics**: Equal Error Rate (EER) targets for speaker de-identification.
- **TA2 Metrics**: Accuracy of human evaluators in identifying modified static traits.
- **TA3 Metrics**: Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) for dynamic trait removal.
- **Latency**: Target metrics of 350ms for Phase 1 and 150ms for Phase 2.
- **Understandability and Naturalness**: Measured through automatic speech recognition systems and listener evaluations.

#### Proposal Submission Requirements

Proposals must include a comprehensive technical and management plan addressing all three TAs and both phases. The submission must adhere to specific formatting guidelines and include a detailed cost proposal if requested. Proposals will be evaluated based on technical merit, relevance to IARPA's mission, and funding availability.

#### Award Information

The government intends to award multiple procurement contracts based on the proposals received. The selection process will be competitive, and awards will depend on the quality of the proposals and the availability of funds.

#### Eligibility Criteria

Eligible applicants include U.S. entities, including small businesses and academic institutions. Proposals must address any potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) and comply with all applicable regulations regarding human and animal subjects, although no research involving these subjects is anticipated under this BAA.

#### Conclusion

The ARTS program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the development of advanced speech anonymization technologies. By addressing critical privacy concerns while maintaining the utility of speech communication, the program aims to enhance the security and confidentiality of spoken interactions in various contexts. Proposals are due by October 16, 2023, and must comply with the detailed submission guidelines outlined in the BAA.
