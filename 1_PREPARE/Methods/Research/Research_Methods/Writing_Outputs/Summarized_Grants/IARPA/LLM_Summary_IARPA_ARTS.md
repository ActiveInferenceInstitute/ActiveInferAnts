### Summary of the Grant Application for the Anonymous Real-Time Speech (ARTS) Program

#### Overview
The Department of the Interior (DOI), in partnership with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Anonymous Real-Time Speech (ARTS) program. This initiative aims to develop innovative systems capable of modifying spontaneous speech in real-time to protect individual privacy. The program is structured into two phases, focusing initially on English and subsequently on non-English languages.

#### Program Goals and Technical Areas
The ARTS program is designed to address three primary Technical Areas (TAs):
1. **Speaker De-Identification (SDID)**: This area focuses on modifying speech signals to prevent speaker identification systems from recognizing the speaker.
2. **Modification of Static Traits**: This involves altering inherent traits in speech, such as dialect, gender, and age, and replacing them with pre-selected traits.
3. **Removal of Dynamic Traits**: This area aims to modify speech to obscure short-term emotional and psychological states.

Each solution must adhere to specific utility constraints, including latency (350ms for Phase 1 and 150ms for Phase 2), understandability, and naturalness.

#### Program Phases
- **Phase 1** (18 months): Focuses on English language speech processing.
- **Phase 2** (18 months): Expands to include non-English languages, starting with Spanish.

#### Team Composition and Expertise
The program encourages multidisciplinary teams with expertise in areas such as speech processing, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Proposals must demonstrate a clear understanding of the technical challenges and provide a robust plan for addressing them.

#### Data and Evaluation
The government will provide speech data for development and evaluation purposes. Performers may also use external data with prior approval. The Test and Evaluation (T&E) process will involve independent assessments of the developed systems, with regular feedback to enhance research approaches.

#### Metrics for Success
The program outlines specific metrics for evaluating the performance of solutions in each TA, including:
- **TA1**: Equal Error Rate (EER) targets.
- **TA2**: Accuracy of human evaluators in identifying modified traits.
- **TA3**: Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) for emotional trait removal.
- Additional metrics for latency, understandability, and naturalness.

#### Proposal Submission Requirements
Proposals must include:
- A comprehensive technical and management plan addressing all TAs.
- A detailed cost proposal, if requested.
- Compliance with submission formats and deadlines.
- Addressing potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI).

#### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on:
1. **Technical Merit**: Innovation and feasibility of the proposed solutions.
2. **Work Plan Effectiveness**: Clarity and realism of the proposed milestones and metrics.
3. **Relevance to IARPA Goals**: Alignment with the mission and objectives of the IARPA.
4. **Experience and Expertise**: Qualifications of the team members and their ability to execute the proposed work.
5. **Resource Realism**: Justification of the proposed resources and costs.

#### Award Information
The government anticipates awarding multiple contracts based on the proposals received. The selection process will follow the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines, and awards will be contingent upon successful negotiations.

#### Administrative and Compliance Requirements
Proposers must comply with various administrative requirements, including:
- Intellectual property rights management.
- Reporting obligations.
- Adherence to export control laws.
- Ensuring the protection of privacy and confidentiality in data handling.

#### Conclusion
The ARTS program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of privacy-preserving speech technologies. By addressing the outlined technical areas and adhering to the program's stringent requirements, proposers can play a crucial role in enhancing individual privacy in an increasingly connected world.
