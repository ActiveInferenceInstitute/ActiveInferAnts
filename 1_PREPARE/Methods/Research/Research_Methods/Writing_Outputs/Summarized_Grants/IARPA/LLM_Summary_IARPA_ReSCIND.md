### Summary of the ReSCIND Program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)

#### Program Overview
The Reimagining Security with Cyberpsychology-Informed Network Defenses (ReSCIND) Program, initiated by the Naval Information Warfare Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific) on behalf of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), aims to enhance cybersecurity by developing innovative defenses that leverage the cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers. The program will span 45 months, starting in November 2023, and will be executed in three distinct phases. The primary goal is to manipulate attacker decision-making processes to increase their operational costs and reduce their effectiveness.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives
The ReSCIND program is structured around five key technical challenges:

1. **Identification of Cognitive Vulnerabilities (CogVulns)**: This involves identifying and providing evidence of cognitive biases and limitations that can be exploited to disrupt cyber attackers.
   
2. **Understanding and Inducing Behavioral Changes**: This objective focuses on measuring and inducing changes in cyber attack behavior, thereby impacting the success of such attacks.

3. **Development of Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs)**: These defenses will be designed to measurably disrupt cyber attack behavior during both early and late stages of an attack.

4. **Creation of Cyber-specific Computational Cognitive Models (C3Ms)**: These models will reflect and predict changes in attacker behavior in response to the implemented defenses.

5. **Production of Adaptive Psychology-informed Defenses (APhiDs)**: These systems will automate the selection of CyphiDs based on real-time observations of attacker behavior.

#### Program Phases
The program is divided into three phases:

- **Phase 1 (18 months)**: Focuses on identifying relevant CogVulns and developing bias sensors and triggers. This phase requires a comprehensive experimental protocol for human subjects research.

- **Phase 2 (15 months)**: Involves the development of CyphiDs that can disrupt cyber attack behavior. This phase will also refine the CogVuln Playbook based on findings from Phase 1.

- **Phase 3 (12 months)**: Aims to develop APhiDs and C3Ms based on experimental results from the previous phases. This phase will also include extensive testing and validation of the developed models and defenses.

#### Proposal Requirements
Proposals must address all technical challenges and phases, including:

- A detailed experimental protocol for Phase 1.
- Evidence of team expertise in relevant disciplines such as behavioral science, cognitive psychology, and cybersecurity.
- Identification of technical risks and proposed mitigation strategies.
- A clear software development approach.

#### Funding Information
The funding opportunity is classified under the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) category, with multiple awards anticipated. The proposal submission deadlines are as follows:

- **Q&A Deadline**: April 25, 2023
- **Proposal Due Date**: May 26, 2023

#### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on several factors, including:

- Overall scientific and technical merit.
- Effectiveness of the proposed work plan.
- Contribution to IARPA's mission and program goals.
- Relevant experience and expertise of the team.
- Resource realism and budget constraints.

#### Conclusion
The ReSCIND Program represents a significant advancement in cybersecurity by integrating principles of cyberpsychology to develop defenses that exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of attackers. Through a structured approach across three phases, the program seeks to create a robust set of tools and methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of cyber defenses, ultimately contributing to national security objectives. Proposals that align with the program's goals and demonstrate innovative approaches are encouraged to participate in this competitive funding opportunity.
