### Summary of the ReSCIND Program BAA

#### Program Overview
The Reimagining Security with Cyberpsychology-Informed Network Defenses (ReSCIND) Program, initiated by the Naval Information Warfare Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific) on behalf of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), aims to enhance cybersecurity by developing innovative defenses that exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers. The program is structured as a 45-month effort divided into three phases, commencing in November 2023. The primary goal is to manipulate attacker decision-making processes, thereby increasing the resources and effort required for successful cyber attacks.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives
The program outlines five key technical challenges:
1. **Identification of Cognitive Vulnerabilities (CogVulns)**: Research will focus on recognizing and providing evidence of cognitive vulnerabilities that are pertinent to cyber attackers.
2. **Understanding and Measuring Attack Behavior**: The program seeks to comprehend, quantify, and influence changes in cyber attack behavior and success rates.
3. **Development of Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs)**: These defenses will be designed to disrupt cyber attack behavior at both early and late stages.
4. **Creation of Cyber-specific Computational Cognitive Models (C3Ms)**: These models will predict and reflect attacker behavior based on cognitive vulnerabilities.
5. **Production of Adaptive Psychology-informed Defenses (APhiDs)**: These systems will automate the selection of CyphiDs based on real-time observations of attacker behavior.

#### Program Phases
The ReSCIND program is divided into three phases:
- **Phase 1 (18 months)**: Focuses on identifying relevant CogVulns and developing bias sensors and triggers.
- **Phase 2 (15 months)**: Involves the creation of CyphiDs that measurably disrupt cyber attack behavior.
- **Phase 3 (12 months)**: Aims to develop APhiDs and C3Ms based on experimental results from the previous phases.

#### Proposal Requirements
Proposals must address all technical challenges and phases, including:
- A comprehensive experimental protocol for Phase 1 human subjects research.
- A description of the team's expertise in relevant disciplines.
- Identification of technical risks and mitigation strategies.
- A detailed software development approach.

#### Additional Considerations
- Proposals must comply with ethical standards for human subjects research, including obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.
- The program emphasizes the importance of collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, encouraging partnerships that bring together expertise in behavioral science, cognitive psychology, cybersecurity, and software development.

#### Conclusion
The ReSCIND Program represents a significant advancement in cybersecurity research, focusing on the human elements of cyber attacks. By leveraging cognitive psychology, the program aims to create innovative defenses that not only detect but also disrupt the decision-making processes of attackers, ultimately enhancing the security posture of networks. Proposals are expected to be comprehensive, addressing all outlined challenges and demonstrating a clear understanding of the program's objectives.
