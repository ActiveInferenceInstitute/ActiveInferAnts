### Summary of Grant Application: Biointelligence and Biosecurity for the Intelligence Community (B24IC) Seedling Research Topic

#### Overview
The Naval Information Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific), in collaboration with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the funding opportunity number N66001-22-S-4704. This BAA focuses on advancing research in biointelligence and biosecurity to address the evolving threats posed by biological sciences in the 21st century. The solicitation aims to attract innovative research proposals that leverage advancements in synthetic biology and biotechnology to enhance the capabilities of the Intelligence Community (IC).

#### Funding and Award Information
The funding opportunity is structured as a two-year Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) initiative. The BAA anticipates multiple awards, with a total award value for combined Phase A and Phase B not exceeding $4 million. The application process is divided into two steps: submission of white papers followed by full proposals for selected applicants. The deadlines for submissions are as follows:
- **White Papers Due**: 5:00 PM ET, July 25, 2022
- **Proposal Due**: 5:00 PM ET, September 13, 2022

#### Research Objectives
IARPA seeks to develop novel technologies and methodologies that enhance the IC's ability to detect, analyze, and respond to biological threats. The research topics of interest are categorized into two main areas:

1. **Biointelligence**: This includes the development of instruments and methods that enhance the IC's capabilities to counter the misuse of biological sciences and leverage advancements in these fields to improve data collection, analysis, and security related to biological threats.

2. **Biosecurity**: This focuses on ensuring the security of biological research environments, instruments, and data, preventing potential harm to organisms, materials, or infrastructure.

#### Research Areas of Interest
The BAA outlines specific topics and areas of interest under the two main categories:

**A. Biointelligence**
- Methods for attributing biological materials and organisms.
- Development of sensitive, target-agnostic instrumentation for biomolecule detection.
- Creation of biological systems with autonomous responses based on external stimuli.
- Techniques for the loss-less collection and sterilization of biomolecules from complex environments.
- Integration of multi-modal data types to identify health incidents.

**B. Biosecurity**
- Assurance of digital and physical security for biological research infrastructure.
- Detection and characterization of biological targets, including toxins and synthetic biomolecules.
- Development of methods for remote health status evaluation.
- Techniques for reducing storage requirements and improving data transfer of â€˜omics data.
- Real-time analysis of multi-modal data to enhance understanding of biological research activities.

#### Proposal Requirements
Proposals must be structured in two phases:
- **Phase A**: Initial proof of concept lasting up to 9 months, with preliminary reports due at 4 and 8 months.
- **Phase B**: If exercised, this phase will last no longer than 15 months and will build upon the findings of Phase A.

Proposals must demonstrate the potential for revolutionary improvements in biointelligence and biosecurity capabilities, with clearly defined objectives, milestones, and performance metrics. Research that results in only incremental improvements is not eligible.

#### Eligibility and Submission Guidelines
All responsible sources are eligible to submit proposals, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), small businesses, and minority institutions. However, entities with special relationships with the government, such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, are not eligible.

The submission process requires:
1. **White Paper Submission**: A concise document summarizing qualifications and intended technical approaches, limited to 3 pages.
2. **Full Proposal Submission**: For those approved after the white paper review, proposals must include a technical and management proposal, as well as a cost/price proposal.

#### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on:
- **Technical Merit**: Novelty, feasibility, and completeness of the proposed approach.
- **Relevance to IARPA Mission**: Potential contributions to national security and the ability to transition technology to operational use.
- **Funding Availability**: Consideration of budget constraints and program balance.

#### Conclusion
This BAA represents an opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of biointelligence and biosecurity technologies that are critical for national security. By fostering innovative research and multidisciplinary collaboration, IARPA aims to enhance the IC's capabilities in addressing biological threats effectively. The application process is designed to encourage high-risk, high-reward research that can lead to significant advancements in the field.
