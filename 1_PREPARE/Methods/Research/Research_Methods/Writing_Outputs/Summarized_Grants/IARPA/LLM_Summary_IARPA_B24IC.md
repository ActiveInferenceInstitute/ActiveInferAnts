### Summary of the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Biointelligence and Biosecurity

#### Overview

The Naval Information Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific), in collaboration with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the funding opportunity number N66001-22-S-4704. This BAA aims to solicit innovative research proposals focused on biointelligence and biosecurity to address the evolving biological threats faced by the Intelligence Community (IC). The announcement emphasizes the need for novel technologies and methodologies that leverage advancements in synthetic biology and biotechnology.

#### Key Information

- **Release Date**: July 7, 2022
- **Funding Type**: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) for a duration of two years.
- **Proposal Submission Dates**:
  - White Papers Due: July 25, 2022
  - Full Proposals Due: September 13, 2022
- **Award Type**: Multiple procurement contracts are anticipated, with the total award value for combined phases not exceeding $4 million.

#### Objectives

IARPA's primary objective is to develop capabilities that enhance the IC's ability to counter biological threats and leverage advancements in biological sciences. The BAA seeks to support research in two main areas:

1. **Biointelligence**: This includes methods and instruments that improve the IC's ability to detect, analyze, and respond to biological threats.
2. **Biosecurity**: This focuses on ensuring the security of biological research and technologies, preventing misuse, and protecting against potential harm to organisms and infrastructure.

#### Research Areas of Interest

The BAA outlines specific topics of interest within the realms of biointelligence and biosecurity:

- **Biointelligence**:
  - Advanced methods for attributing biological materials.
  - Development of sensitive, target-agnostic detection instruments.
  - Creation of biological systems with autonomous responses.
  - Techniques for the loss-less collection and sterilization of biomolecules.
  - Integration of diverse data types to identify health incidents.

- **Biosecurity**:
  - Security measures for biological infrastructure and data.
  - Detection methods for biological targets, including toxins and venoms.
  - Instruments for remote health status evaluation.
  - Strategies for managing large datasets in biological research.

#### Proposal Structure and Evaluation

Proposals must be structured in two phases:

- **Phase A**: Initial proof of concept lasting up to 9 months, with preliminary reports due at 4 and 8 months.
- **Phase B**: If exercised, this phase will extend for up to 15 months to further develop the proof of concept into a demonstration.

Proposals must demonstrate revolutionary potential rather than incremental improvements and should include defined objectives, milestones, and performance metrics.

#### Eligibility and Submission Process

Eligible applicants include all responsible sources, with encouragement for participation from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), small businesses, and minority institutions. Proposals must be unclassified and submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS).

The submission process consists of two steps:

1. **White Paper Submission**: Required for initial qualification.
2. **Full Proposal Submission**: Only approved white paper submitters will be invited to submit full proposals.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

- **Technical Merit**: Novelty, feasibility, and completeness of the proposed approach.
- **Relevance to IARPA's Mission**: Contribution to national security and the potential for technological advancement.
- **Funding Availability**: Budget constraints and program balance.

#### Award Administration

The Government reserves the right to negotiate with selected Offerors and may award contracts without discussions. All proposals will be retained for evaluation purposes, and the Government will ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including export controls.

#### Conclusion

This BAA represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of biointelligence and biosecurity technologies. By fostering innovative research, IARPA aims to enhance the capabilities of the Intelligence Community in addressing the complex biological threats of the 21st century. Interested parties are encouraged to submit white papers and proposals that align with the outlined objectives and areas of interest.
