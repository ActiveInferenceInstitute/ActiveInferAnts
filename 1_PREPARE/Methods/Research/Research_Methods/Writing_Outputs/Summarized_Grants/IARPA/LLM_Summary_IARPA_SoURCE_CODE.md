### Summary of IARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) IARPA-BAA-24-02: SoURCE CODE

#### Introduction
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments" (SoURCE CODE), aimed at developing innovative technologies to assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks based on coding styles. This initiative is crucial in addressing the increasing complexity and volume of cyber threats that pose significant risks to national security.

#### Key Dates and Amendments
- **Release Date:** November 15, 2023
- **Amendments:** 
  - Amendment 001 on December 13, 2023, which updated submission dates and eligibility criteria.
  - Amendment 002 on January 19, 2024, which further refined submission deadlines.

#### Program Overview
The SoURCE CODE program seeks to create technologies that enhance the ability of forensic analysts to determine the origins of cyberattacks by analyzing similarities in binary and source code files. The program will explore advanced feature spaces beyond traditional lexical and syntactic analysis, incorporating semantic and behavioral features to improve attribution accuracy.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives
The BAA outlines three primary focus areas for development:
1. **Feature Space Generation and Extraction:** Developing encoding schemes to project software representations into optimized feature spaces.
2. **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms:** Creating systems to identify similar binaries and infer demographic information about authors.
3. **System Explainability:** Ensuring that the systems provide interpretable feedback to forensic experts, explaining the rationale behind similarity assessments.

#### Program Phases
The SoURCE CODE program is structured into two phases over 30 months:
- **Phase 1 (18 months):** Focus on foundational research, feature extraction, and developing algorithms for similarity matching.
- **Phase 2 (12 months):** Extension of capabilities to include cross-representation matching (source code to binary and vice versa).

#### Team Expertise and Collaboration
The program encourages multidisciplinary teams, including expertise in binary analysis, software engineering, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Collaboration with forensic experts is highly recommended to enhance the practical applicability of the developed technologies.

#### Program Scope and Limitations
Proposals must address:
- Theoretical foundations of proposed strategies.
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies.
- Software architecture and integration approaches.

Out of scope areas include reliance on existing cybersecurity solutions without innovation, dynamic analysis approaches, and hardware system development.

#### Program Data
The program will utilize both development and evaluation datasets, with a focus on creating diverse and representative data for training and testing algorithms. Performers are encouraged to supplement government-provided datasets with their own, ensuring compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.

#### Testing and Evaluation (T&E)
T&E will be conducted by an independent team to ensure that research outcomes align with program objectives. The evaluation process will include rigorous testing against established metrics, with feedback provided to performers to refine their approaches.

#### Proposal Submission Requirements
Proposals must be submitted in two volumes:
1. **Volume 1 - Technical and Management Proposal:** Limited to 25 pages for unclassified submissions, detailing the technical approach, team qualifications, and project management plans.
2. **Volume 2 - Cost Proposal:** To be submitted only upon request, detailing the budget breakdown and justification for costs.

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible applicants include U.S. organizations, with specific encouragement for small businesses and academic institutions. Foreign entities may participate only as part of a U.S.-based team. Proposals must address potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI).

#### Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on:
- Overall scientific and technical merit.
- Effectiveness of the proposed work plan.
- Contribution to IARPA's mission.
- Relevant experience and expertise of the team.
- Resource realism and budget justification.

#### Award Information
IARPA anticipates multiple awards based on the quality of proposals and available funding. The government reserves the right to negotiate contract terms and may select proposals for negotiation without discussions.

#### Conclusion
The SoURCE CODE program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to national security by developing advanced forensic technologies. The emphasis on innovative approaches to cyber attribution aligns with IARPA's mission to enhance the U.S. intelligence community's capabilities in addressing evolving cyber threats. Interested parties are encouraged to review the BAA thoroughly and prepare proposals that meet the outlined requirements and objectives.
