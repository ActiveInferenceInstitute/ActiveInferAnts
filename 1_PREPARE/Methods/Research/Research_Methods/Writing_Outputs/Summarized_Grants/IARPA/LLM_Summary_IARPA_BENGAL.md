# Summary of the Broad Agency Announcement for Bias Effects and Notable Generative AI Limitations (BENGAL) Targeted Super Seedling Research Topics (IARPA-BAA-24-03)

## Overview

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Bias Effects and Notable Generative AI Limitations (BENGAL)" to solicit proposals for early-stage research aimed at understanding and mitigating biases and limitations associated with generative AI technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). The BAA emphasizes the need for innovative solutions that enhance the safe adoption and use of generative AI within the Intelligence Community (IC).

### Key Dates

- **Release Date:** November 17, 2023
- **White Papers Due:** December 5, 2023, 12:00 PM EST
- **Proposal Due Date:** February 9, 2024, 4:00 PM EST
- **Questions Submission Deadline:** December 14, 2023, 4:00 PM EST

### Funding and Awards

IARPA anticipates multiple awards under this BAA, with a total funding limit of less than $4 million for combined Phase A (Base Period) and Phase B (Option Period). The BAA is structured in two phases:

1. **Phase A (12 months):** Proof of Concept development.
2. **Phase B (12 months):** Demonstration capability development based on successful Phase A outcomes.

## Program Overview

IARPA's mission is to invest in high-risk, high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with a significant intelligence advantage. The BENGAL initiative aims to address the challenges posed by biases in LLMs and their potential for generating harmful outputs. The program seeks to develop technologies that can detect, characterize, and mitigate these biases and limitations.

### Technical Challenges and Objectives

The BENGAL program focuses on several key areas:

1. **Biases and Induction of Diverse Analytical Perspectives:** Developing capabilities to identify and mitigate biases in LLM outputs, enhancing the diversity of perspectives presented to users.
   
2. **AI Hallucinations and Inferences:** Addressing the issue of LLMs generating ungrounded outputs (hallucinations) while maximizing their ability to make valid inferences.

3. **Safe Information Flow in Sensitive Environments:** Creating LLM technologies that facilitate information sharing within the IC while minimizing the risk of sensitive information disclosure.

4. **Working Resiliently with Imperfect or Poisoned Sources:** Developing techniques to evaluate the reliability of information sources and enabling users to extract reliable intelligence from potentially biased or malicious content.

## Proposal Submission Process

### White Papers

Interested parties are encouraged to submit white papers summarizing their qualifications and proposed technical approaches. The government will review these submissions and encourage or discourage full proposals based on the white paper evaluations.

### Proposal Structure

Proposals must address both Phase A and Phase B, detailing technical objectives, task descriptions, and performance metrics. The proposals should demonstrate the potential for revolutionary improvements in generative AI capabilities, rather than incremental advancements.

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

- **Technical Merit:** Novelty, feasibility, and completeness of the proposed approach.
- **Relevance to IARPA's Mission:** Potential contributions to national security and the intelligence technology base.
- **Funding Availability:** Consideration of budget constraints and program balance.

## Eligibility Information

All responsible sources capable of meeting the government's needs may submit proposals. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), small businesses, and minority institutions are encouraged to participate. However, entities with special relationships with the government that provide them access to privileged information are not eligible.

## Application and Submission Information

### Submission Process

Proposals must be submitted electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS). Detailed instructions for white paper and proposal submissions are provided in the BAA.

### Required Documentation

Proposals must include:

- Technical and Management Proposal (Volume 1)
- Cost/Price Proposal (Volume 2)
- Academic Institution Acknowledgment Letters (if applicable)
- Intellectual Property Rights assertions
- Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) certifications

## Award Administration Information

### Award Notices

Offerors will be notified of their proposal status following the evaluation process. Selected proposals will enter negotiations for contract awards.

### Reporting Requirements

Awardees will be required to submit monthly technical and financial status reports, along with a final report at the conclusion of the project.

## Conclusion

The BENGAL BAA represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the understanding and mitigation of biases in generative AI technologies. By addressing the outlined technical challenges, participants can play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness and safety of AI applications within the Intelligence Community.
