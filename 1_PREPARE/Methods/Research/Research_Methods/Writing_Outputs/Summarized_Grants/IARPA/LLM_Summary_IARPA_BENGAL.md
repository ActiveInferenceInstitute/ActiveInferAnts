### Summary of the Broad Agency Announcement for Bias Effects and Notable Generative AI Limitations (BENGAL) Targeted Super Seedling Research Topics (IARPA-BAA-24-03)

#### Overview

The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) has released a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Bias Effects and Notable Generative AI Limitations (BENGAL) Targeted Super Seedling Research Topics" (IARPA-BAA-24-03) on November 17, 2023. This initiative seeks proposals for early-stage research aimed at understanding and mitigating biases and limitations associated with generative AI technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). The BAA emphasizes the need for innovative solutions that enhance the safe adoption of generative AI within the Intelligence Community (IC).

#### Key Dates and Submission Information

- **Release Date:** November 17, 2023
- **White Papers Due:** December 5, 2023, 12:00 PM EST
- **Proposal Due Date:** February 9, 2024, 4:00 PM EST
- **Questions Submission Deadline:** December 14, 2023, 4:00 PM EST

Interested parties are encouraged to submit white papers for preliminary evaluation before formal proposals. The submission of white papers will open on December 1, 2023.

#### Program Overview

IARPA's mission is to invest in high-risk, high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with a significant intelligence advantage. The BENGAL initiative focuses on the following objectives:

1. **Understanding LLM Threat Modes:** Identifying and quantifying potential threats posed by LLMs, including biases and erroneous outputs.
2. **Developing Mitigation Strategies:** Creating novel methods to detect, correct, or work resiliently with the vulnerabilities of LLMs.
3. **Enhancing Safe Use:** Ensuring that generative AI technologies can be safely integrated into various applications within the IC.

#### Technical Challenges and Objectives

The BAA outlines several technical challenges that researchers are encouraged to address:

1. **Biases and Induction of Diverse Analytical Perspectives:** Developing technologies to detect and characterize biases in LLM outputs and to promote diverse perspectives in analysis.
   
2. **AI Hallucinations and Inferences:** Creating methods to reduce spurious outputs (hallucinations) while allowing LLMs to make valid inferences based on incomplete information.

3. **Safe Information Flow in Sensitive Environments:** Designing LLM technologies that facilitate information sharing while minimizing the risk of sensitive data disclosure.

4. **Working Resiliently with Imperfect Sources:** Developing techniques to evaluate the reliability of information sources and to extract reliable intelligence from biased or incomplete content.

#### Proposal Structure and Requirements

Proposals must be structured to address two phases:

- **Phase A (Base Period):** A 12-month Proof of Concept phase, focusing on demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.
- **Phase B (Option Period):** A subsequent 12-month phase that builds on the results of Phase A to deliver a demonstration capability.

Proposals should include:

- A clear technical overview and objectives.
- A detailed Statement of Work (SOW) outlining tasks and deliverables.
- A comprehensive budget and cost proposal.
- A testing and evaluation protocol to measure progress and success.

#### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:

1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit:** Novelty, feasibility, and completeness of the proposed approach.
2. **Potential Contribution to IARPA's Mission:** Alignment with national security technology goals and the potential for significant impact.
3. **Funding Availability:** Consideration of budget constraints and program balance.

#### Eligibility and Award Information

The BAA is open to all responsible sources capable of meeting the Government's needs. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, small businesses, and minority institutions are encouraged to participate. Multiple awards are anticipated, with a total funding limit of less than $4,000,000 for combined Phase A and Phase B efforts.

#### Submission Process

Submissions must be made electronically through the IARPA Distribution and Evaluation System (IDEAS). Offerors are responsible for ensuring timely and compliant submissions. Late submissions may not be reviewed.

#### Conclusion

The BENGAL initiative represents a significant opportunity for researchers to contribute to the safe and effective use of generative AI technologies within the Intelligence Community. By addressing the outlined technical challenges, participants can help mitigate biases and vulnerabilities associated with LLMs, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of the U.S. intelligence apparatus.
