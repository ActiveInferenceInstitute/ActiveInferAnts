# Summary of Grant Application: Broad Agency Announcement HR001123S0045 - Biological Technologies

## Overview

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), through its Biological Technologies Office (BTO), has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (HR001123S0045) on June 22, 2023, inviting innovative research proposals in biological technologies. This announcement aims to support revolutionary research ideas that are not currently being addressed by ongoing BTO programs or other solicitations. The application process is open until June 20, 2024, with proposals accepted on a rolling basis.

## Funding Opportunity Description

The BTO's mission is to leverage biological properties—adaptation, replication, resilience, and complexity—to enhance national security and support warfighters. The BAA seeks proposals in various topic areas, including:

1. **General Biological Technologies**: Research that aligns with BTO’s national security mission.
2. **Human Performance**: Focus on neurological health, cognitive performance, and physiological resilience, particularly in extreme conditions.
3. **Materials, Sensors, and Processing**: Development of novel materials and sensors inspired by biological systems.
4. **Ecosystem and Environmental Technologies**: Innovations that support operations in extreme environments and enhance ecosystem resilience.
5. **Biosecurity and Biosafety**: Technologies ensuring the safety and security of biological data and hardware.
6. **Biomedical and Biodefense**: Rapid manufacturing and delivery of therapeutics and diagnostics for warfighter health.

## Award Information

### General Award Information

- Multiple awards are anticipated, with the total funding dependent on the quality of proposals and available resources.
- Award types may include procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for prototypes or research.
- The government reserves the right to negotiate all, some, or none of the proposals received.

### Fundamental Research

The BAA emphasizes the importance of fundamental research, defined as basic and applied research in science and engineering, with results typically published and shared broadly. Proposals may involve both fundamental and non-fundamental research, and the government will assess the nature of the research during the evaluation process.

## Eligibility Information

### Eligible Applicants

All responsible sources capable of fulfilling the government's needs may submit proposals. Special encouragement is given to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), small businesses, and minority institutions. However, no portion of the announcement is reserved for these entities.

### Organizational Conflicts of Interest

Proposers must disclose any potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) and provide a mitigation plan to prevent bias or unfair competitive advantage.

### Cost Sharing/Matching

Cost sharing is not required but may be considered favorably if there is potential for commercial application.

## Application and Submission Information

### Proposal Submission

Proposals must be submitted in English, formatted for 8.5 x 11-inch paper, with 1-inch margins and 12-point font. The submission includes two volumes: Volume I (Technical and Management Proposal) and Volume II (Cost Proposal). 

#### Volume I must include:
- Cover Sheet
- Executive Summary
- Goals and Impact
- Technical Plan
- Management Plan
- Capabilities
- Statement of Work (SOW)
- Schedule and Milestones

#### Volume II must include:
- Cover Sheet
- Detailed cost breakdown by phase and task
- Itemized costs for direct labor, materials, equipment, travel, and other direct costs.

### Submission Process

Proposals can be submitted electronically via DARPA’s BAA website or through Grants.gov for grants and cooperative agreements. All submissions must be received by the specified deadlines.

## Application Review Information

### Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be evaluated based on:
1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**: Innovation, feasibility, and completeness of the technical approach.
2. **Potential Contribution and Relevance**: Alignment with DARPA’s mission and potential impact on national security.
3. **Cost Realism**: Realistic cost estimates that reflect the proposed technical approach.

### Review Process

DARPA will conduct a scientific and technical review of each conforming proposal. Proposals that do not meet the requirements may be deemed non-conforming and removed from consideration.

## Award Administration Information

### Reporting Requirements

Awardees will be required to submit various reports, including monthly financial status reports and technical status reports. A final report summarizing the project will also be required at the conclusion of the performance period.

### Compliance and Security

Proposers must comply with all applicable federal regulations, including those related to controlled unclassified information (CUI) and safeguarding covered defense information.

## Agency Contacts

For administrative, technical, or contractual questions, proposers can contact the BAA Coordinator via email at BTOBAA2023@darpa.mil.

## Conclusion

The BAA HR001123S0045 represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of biological technologies that support national security objectives. With a focus on innovative and impactful research, DARPA encourages a wide range of proposals that align with its mission to protect and prepare U.S. warfighters.
