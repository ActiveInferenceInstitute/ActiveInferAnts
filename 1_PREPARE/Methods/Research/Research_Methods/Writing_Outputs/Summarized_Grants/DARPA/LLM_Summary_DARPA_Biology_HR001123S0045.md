### Summary of Grant Application: Broad Agency Announcement for Biological Technologies (HR001123S0045)

#### Overview
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) to solicit innovative research proposals that address gaps in ongoing BTO programs or other solicitations. The announcement, numbered HR001123S0045, was posted on June 22, 2023, and will remain open for submissions until June 20, 2024. The BAA aims to leverage biological technologies to enhance national security and improve the capabilities of U.S. Warfighters.

#### Funding Opportunity Description
The BTO's mission is to harness the unique properties of biology—such as adaptation, replication, resilience, and complexity—to develop capabilities that can revolutionize defense strategies. The BAA invites proposals in several key areas, including:

1. **Human Performance**: Research focused on neurological health, cognitive performance, and physiological resilience in extreme conditions.
2. **Materials, Sensors, and Processing**: Development of novel materials and sensors inspired by biological systems, and technologies for the integration of biological systems into built environments.
3. **Ecosystem and Environmental Technologies**: Innovations that leverage synthetic biology and ecological diversity to support operations in extreme environments and restore ecosystems.
4. **Biosecurity and Biosafety**: Technologies ensuring the safety and security of biological data and hardware, as well as the detection and prevention of infectious diseases.
5. **Biomedical and Biodefense**: Development of rapid manufacturing and delivery systems for therapeutics, diagnostics, and countermeasures against biological threats.

#### Award Information
DARPA anticipates multiple awards under this BAA, with the funding amount dependent on the quality of proposals and available resources. The agency reserves the right to negotiate all, some, or none of the proposals received. Award instruments may include procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for prototypes or research.

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible applicants include all responsible sources capable of meeting the government's needs. Special encouragement is given to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), small businesses, and minority institutions. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and government entities may also apply, provided they demonstrate that the proposed work is not available from the private sector.

#### Application and Submission Information
Proposals must be submitted in English, formatted for 8.5 x 11-inch paper, with a minimum 12-point font size. The submission process includes an abstract phase, where proposers are encouraged to submit a concise summary of their proposal for preliminary feedback. Full proposals will be evaluated based on scientific and technical merit, relevance to DARPA's mission, and cost realism.

#### Application Review Information
Proposals will be evaluated based on three primary criteria:
1. **Overall Scientific and Technical Merit**: The innovation, feasibility, and completeness of the proposed technical approach.
2. **Potential Contribution and Relevance**: The relevance of the proposed effort to DARPA's mission and its potential impact on national security.
3. **Cost Realism**: The realism of proposed costs in relation to the technical approach and objectives.

#### Award Administration Information
Awardees will be required to submit regular progress reports, including monthly financial status updates and technical status reports. DARPA will also conduct periodic evaluations to ensure compliance with the terms of the award.

#### Agency Contacts
For inquiries related to the BAA, proposers can contact DARPA via email at BTOBAA2023@darpa.mil or through the mailing address provided in the announcement.

#### Conclusion
The BAA HR001123S0045 represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of biological technologies that can enhance U.S. national security and improve the capabilities of Warfighters. The emphasis on innovative approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration aligns with DARPA's mission to foster groundbreaking advancements in defense technologies.
