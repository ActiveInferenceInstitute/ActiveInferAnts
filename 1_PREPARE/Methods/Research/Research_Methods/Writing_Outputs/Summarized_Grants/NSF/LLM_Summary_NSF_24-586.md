### Summary of NSF 24-586: NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds (NQVL) Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD): II. Design & Implementation Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has initiated the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) program to enhance the United States' leadership in quantum information science and technology. This solicitation outlines the proposal submission and review process for the Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD) component, specifically focusing on the Design and Implementation phases. The NQVL aims to facilitate the transition from fundamental research to practical applications in quantum technologies, fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders, including academia, industry, and government agencies.

#### Program Description
The NQVL program is structured to support the development of quantum technologies through a systematic approach that integrates end-users and potential customers into research cycles. The program emphasizes the importance of education and workforce development in quantum science and engineering (QISE) and aims to lower barriers to participation in the field.

The QSTD projects are the core of the NQVL initiative, progressing through three phases: Pilot, Design, and Implementation. Proposals for the Design phase must be based on a successful Pilot project, while Implementation proposals require a completed Design project. Each project must define a quantum advantage goal and a pathway for achieving it, incorporating user feedback and collaboration.

#### Award Information
The NSF anticipates making approximately 14 awards under this solicitation, with an estimated funding amount of $32 million. QSTD:Design awards may receive up to $2 million per year for two years, while QSTD:Implementation awards may receive up to $10 million per year for six years. The number of awards will depend on the quality of proposals and available funding.

#### Eligibility Information
Proposals may be submitted by any organization, but only one proposal per organization is allowed for either the Design or Implementation phase. Each proposal must have a designated Principal Investigator (PI) and may include co-PIs. The transition from the Pilot to Design phase requires a positive recommendation from a site visit panel, while the transition from Design to Implementation requires a similar recommendation.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Full proposals are required, and preliminary proposals or letters of intent are not necessary. Each proposal must include a detailed Project Execution Plan (PEP), a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and a comprehensive budget.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process based on two primary criteria: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts. Reviewers will assess the scientific goals, feasibility, project management plans, and the potential for societal benefits. The review process may involve site visits and will consider the overall programmatic balance across the NQVL initiative.

#### Award Administration Information
Awards will be made as cooperative agreements, which include specific terms and conditions related to project risks. Awardees must submit annual project reports and adhere to standard NSF reporting requirements. The NSF will conduct periodic reviews to monitor progress and ensure compliance with project milestones.

#### Key Components of the NQVL Program
1. **NQVL:QSTD Projects**: These projects focus on demonstrating quantum advantage through collaborative efforts that integrate user needs and scientific research.
2. **NQVL:TAQS**: This component supports the development of enabling technologies identified by QSTD projects.
3. **NQVL:Central Hub**: This hub promotes collaboration, engagement with the QISE community, and oversight of project success metrics.

#### Conclusion
The NSF's NQVL program represents a significant investment in the future of quantum technologies, aiming to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications. By fostering collaboration across various sectors and promoting education and workforce development, the program seeks to enhance the United States' position in the global quantum landscape. Proposals submitted under this solicitation will play a crucial role in advancing the goals of the NQVL initiative, ultimately leading to transformative advancements in quantum science and technology.
