### Summary of NSF 24-584: Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has issued the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program Solicitation (NSF 24-584), aimed at enhancing the education of technicians in high-technology fields critical to the U.S. economy. This program particularly emphasizes partnerships among two-year institutions of higher education (IHEs), industry, and economic development agencies to improve technician education. The solicitation outlines the program's goals, eligibility criteria, proposal submission guidelines, and funding opportunities.

#### Program Description
The ATE program is designed to support the education of skilled technical workers who utilize advanced science and engineering skills but do not possess a baccalaureate degree. The program encourages projects that focus on curriculum development, professional development for educators, career pathways for students and incumbent workers, and applied research to enhance technician education.

Key areas of focus include:
- **Curriculum Development**: Projects should aim to create or improve credit-bearing courses that align with industry needs.
- **Professional Development**: Programs for educators to enhance their teaching skills and knowledge of current technologies.
- **Career Pathways**: Initiatives that facilitate transitions from secondary education to two-year and four-year degree programs.
- **Research**: Applied research projects that contribute to the knowledge base of technician education.

The program also prioritizes partnerships with organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Manufacturing USA Institutes, and encourages proposals from Minority Serving Institutions and those that aim to broaden participation in STEM fields.

#### Award Information
The ATE program anticipates approximately $74 million in funding for FY2025, with an expected 45 to 80 new awards. The funding structure is categorized into several tracks:
- **Track 1: Small Scale Projects**: Up to $475,000 over three years.
- **Track 2: ATE Projects**: Up to $1,000,000 over three years.
- **Track 3: Consortia for Innovations in Technician Education**: Ranging from $1,200,000 to $3,000,000 over 3-4 years.
- **Track 4: ATE Centers**: Up to $7,500,000 over five years, with potential for renewal.

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible applicants include:
- Two- and four-year IHEs accredited in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- For-profit organizations with capabilities in scientific or engineering research.
- State and local governments and Tribal Nations.

Proposals must be led by faculty from two-year IHEs, with significant roles for these institutions in all projects.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Key components of the proposal include:
- **Project Summary**: Overview of the projectâ€™s focus, activities, and target audience.
- **Project Description**: Limited to 15 pages, detailing goals, objectives, deliverables, management plans, sustainability, evaluation, and dissemination strategies.
- **Evaluation Plan**: Must align with project goals and include metrics for assessing success.
- **Budget**: Must justify all expenses, including any requests for equipment or instrumentation.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process based on two primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge in technician education.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Reviewers will assess the project's alignment with workforce needs, institutional support, and the potential for broad dissemination of results.

#### Reporting Requirements
Awardees must submit annual project reports and a final project outcomes report. These reports will detail accomplishments, participant demographics, and the project's impact on technician education.

#### Conclusion
The NSF ATE program represents a significant investment in the education of skilled technical workers, emphasizing the importance of partnerships and innovative educational practices. By supporting a diverse range of projects, the program aims to enhance the technical workforce's capabilities and ensure alignment with industry needs. Proposals are encouraged to leverage existing resources and build upon successful educational materials to maximize impact and sustainability.
