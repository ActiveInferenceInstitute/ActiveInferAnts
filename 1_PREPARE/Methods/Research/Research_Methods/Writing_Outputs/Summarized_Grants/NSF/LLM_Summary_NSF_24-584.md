### Summary of NSF 24-584: Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has released the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program solicitation (NSF 24-584), aimed at enhancing the education of technicians in high-technology fields crucial to the U.S. economy. This program emphasizes partnerships among two-year institutions of higher education (IHEs), industry, and economic development agencies to improve technician education. The solicitation outlines the program's goals, eligibility requirements, proposal submission guidelines, and funding tracks.

#### Program Description
The ATE program is designed to support the education of skilled technical workers at both the undergraduate and secondary school levels. It focuses on producing qualified science and engineering technicians who do not hold baccalaureate degrees. Key activities supported by the program include:

- Curriculum development and professional development for educators.
- Career pathway development for students and incumbent workers.
- Applied research projects that enhance the knowledge base related to technician education.

The program encourages partnerships with various entities, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Manufacturing USA Institutes, to address workforce development issues. Proposals from Minority Serving Institutions and those that promote diversity in STEM technician education are particularly encouraged.

#### Award Information
The ATE program anticipates approximately $74 million in funding for new and continuing awards in FY2025, with an expected 45 to 80 new awards. The program offers several tracks for funding:

1. **Track 1: Small Scale Projects** - Maximum budget of $475,000 over three years.
2. **Track 2: ATE Projects** - Maximum budget of $1,000,000 over three years.
3. **Track 3: Consortia for Innovations in Technician Education** - Maximum budget of $3,000,000 for collaborations among multiple IHEs.
4. **Track 4: ATE Centers** - Maximum budget of $7,500,000 over five years, focusing on systemic reform and broad outreach.

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible applicants include:

- Two- and four-year IHEs accredited in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- For-profit organizations with capabilities in scientific or engineering research.
- State and local governments and Tribal Nations.

Proposals must be led by faculty from two-year IHEs, with significant leadership roles required for these institutions.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov, adhering to the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG). Key components of the proposal include:

- **Project Summary**: Overview of the project, including disciplinary focus and target audience.
- **Project Description**: Limited to 15 pages, detailing project goals, objectives, activities, management plans, sustainability, evaluation, and dissemination strategies.
- **Evaluation Plan**: Must align with project goals and include metrics for assessing success.
- **Budget**: Must justify all requested funds, including those for equipment, personnel, and travel.

#### Proposal Review Information
Proposals will undergo a merit review process, evaluating both Intellectual Merit (potential to advance knowledge) and Broader Impacts (potential societal benefits). Reviewers will assess the project's rationale, implementation plan, and the qualifications of the project team.

#### Award Administration Information
Award conditions will follow standard NSF guidelines, with specific reporting requirements for project outcomes and impacts. Projects must demonstrate sustainability beyond NSF funding, including institutional commitments to maintain project activities.

#### Conclusion
The ATE program represents a significant investment in the education of the skilled technical workforce, aiming to align educational practices with industry needs. By fostering partnerships and supporting innovative educational practices, the program seeks to enhance the quality and accessibility of technician education across the United States. Proposals are encouraged to build on previous ATE projects and to address the evolving demands of the workforce, particularly in emerging technology fields. 

For further details, potential applicants are encouraged to consult the full solicitation and reach out to program officers for guidance. The deadline for full proposals is October 3, 2024, with subsequent deadlines on the first Thursday in October annually thereafter.
