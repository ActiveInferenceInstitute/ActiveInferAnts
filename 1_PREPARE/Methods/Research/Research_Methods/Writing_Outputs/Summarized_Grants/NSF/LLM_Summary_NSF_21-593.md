#### Overview
The National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of Physics (PHY) invites proposals for investigator-initiated research projects across a broad spectrum of physics disciplines. This solicitation emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within the physics community and encourages proposals that aim to broaden participation among underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

#### Key Dates
- **Full Proposal Deadlines:**
  - **Plasma Physics:** November 20, 2023
  - **AMO, Gravitational Physics, LIGO Research Support, Integrative Activities:** November 22, 2023
  - **Elementary Particle Physics, Particle Astrophysics:** December 5, 2023
  - **Nuclear Physics, Quantum Information Science, Physics of Living Systems:** December 12, 2023

#### Program Requirements
The PHY division supports both experimental and theoretical research in various subfields, including:
- Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics
- Elementary Particle Physics
- Gravitational Physics
- Nuclear Physics
- Particle Astrophysics
- Quantum Information Science
- Physics of Living Systems
- Plasma Physics

The solicitation encourages single proposal submissions for potential co-review rather than multiple related proposals. Proposals that require Antarctic or Arctic logistics support must adhere to additional guidelines.

#### Award Information
- **Anticipated Type of Award:** Standard Grant, Continuing Grant, or Cooperative Agreement
- **Estimated Number of Awards:** 300
- **Anticipated Funding Amount:** $120 million annually, subject to availability.

#### Eligibility
Proposals may be submitted by:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)
- Non-profit organizations
- For-profit organizations
- State and local governments
- Tribal governments
- Foreign organizations (for U.S. portions only)
- Other federal agencies and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs)

There are no restrictions on the number of proposals per organization or PI, but consultation with program officers is encouraged for those with existing awards or multiple submissions.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
- **Full Proposals:** Must be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov, adhering to the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG).
- **Budgetary Information:** Cost sharing is prohibited, and indirect cost limitations do not apply.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process based on two primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit:** Potential to advance knowledge.
2. **Broader Impacts:** Potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Additional criteria may apply for proposals involving large investments or long-duration efforts, which may require special panels for review.

#### Award Administration
- **Notification of Award:** Successful applicants will be notified by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer.
- **Reporting Requirements:** Annual project reports are required, along with a final project report upon completion.

#### Additional Information
The solicitation includes specific provisions for proposals requiring Antarctic or Arctic logistics support, mid-scale research infrastructure, and long-duration efforts. Proposers are encouraged to contact program directors for guidance on proposal development and submission.

#### Conclusion
The NSF 23-615 solicitation provides a comprehensive framework for submitting research proposals in physics, emphasizing the importance of diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration. It outlines the eligibility criteria, proposal preparation guidelines, review processes, and funding opportunities available to researchers in the field.
