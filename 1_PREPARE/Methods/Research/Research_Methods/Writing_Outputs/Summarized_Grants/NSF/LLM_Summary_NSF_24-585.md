### Summary of NSF 24-585: Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Practice (PDaSP) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has launched the Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Practice (PDaSP) program to address the critical need for privacy-preserving data sharing technologies in an increasingly data-driven world. This initiative is in response to the growing importance of data in scientific discovery and innovation, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for responsible data usage. The program aligns with the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, emphasizing the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and the development of testing environments to support these technologies.

#### Program Goals
The PDaSP program aims to:
1. Foster innovative, use-inspired research that transitions theoretical models into practical applications.
2. Address recommendations from the National Strategy to Advance Privacy Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics, particularly the need to accelerate the transition to practice.
3. Develop tools, measurement methods, and testbeds to enhance the usability and inclusiveness of privacy-preserving data sharing solutions.

#### Funding Tracks
The program invites proposals across three distinct tracks, each with specific funding ranges and project durations:

- **Track 1**: Focused on advancing key technologies for practical privacy-preserving data sharing solutions. Funding is expected to range from $500K to $1M for projects lasting up to 2 years.
  
- **Track 2**: Aimed at developing integrated and comprehensive solutions for trustworthy data sharing in application settings. Proposals can receive between $1M and $1.5M for up to 3 years.
  
- **Track 3**: Concentrated on creating usable tools and testbeds for the trustworthy sharing of private data. Funding ranges from $500K to $1.5M for projects lasting up to 3 years.

#### Eligibility
Eligible proposers include:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) accredited in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- U.S.-based small businesses with a strong focus on scientific or engineering research.

Principal Investigators (PIs) must hold appointments at eligible organizations, and there are limits on the number of proposals an individual can submit (maximum of two).

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Full proposals are due by September 27, 2024. No letters of intent or preliminary proposals are required.

Key components of the proposal include:
- **Project Justification**: Articulate the alignment with use-inspired research and address solicitation-specific criteria.
- **Overall Project Management**: Describe the project teamâ€™s expertise and collaboration strategies.
- **Broader Impacts**: Detail how the project will benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

#### Review Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process, evaluated based on two primary criteria: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts. Each track has additional specific review criteria tailored to its focus area. Proposals will be reviewed by NSF Program Officers and external experts, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation.

#### Award Information
The anticipated funding amount for the PDaSP program is $23 million, with an estimated number of awards being 26. This includes up to 12 Track 1 awards, 7 Track 2 awards, and 7 Track 3 awards, contingent on the quality of submissions and available funds.

#### Partnerships and Collaboration
The PDaSP program is a collaborative effort involving industry partners such as Intel Corporation and VMware LLC, as well as federal agencies like the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These partnerships aim to enhance the program's impact and facilitate the development of practical solutions.

#### Reporting and Award Conditions
Award recipients must comply with NSF's reporting requirements, including annual project reports and a final project outcomes report. Additionally, recipients are required to acknowledge NSF and partner support in publications and reports. Intellectual property resulting from the research must be dedicated to the public, with software offered under open-source licenses.

#### Conclusion
The PDaSP program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the development of privacy-preserving data sharing technologies. By fostering innovative research and collaboration across sectors, the program aims to enhance the responsible use of data in a manner that protects individual privacy and promotes societal benefits. Proposals that align with the program's goals and demonstrate practical applications of privacy-preserving technologies are encouraged to apply by the specified deadline.
