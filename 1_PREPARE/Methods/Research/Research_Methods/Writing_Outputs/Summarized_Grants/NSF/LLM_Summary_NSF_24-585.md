### Summary of NSF 24-585: Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Practice (PDaSP) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has launched the Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in Practice (PDaSP) program to address the growing need for privacy-preserving technologies (PETs) in data sharing and analytics. This initiative aligns with the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI EO) and the National Strategy to Advance Privacy Preserving Data Sharing and Analytics (PPDSA). The program aims to foster the development of practical, scalable, and deployable solutions that enable responsible data sharing while minimizing privacy risks.

#### Program Goals
The PDaSP program seeks to:
1. Accelerate the transition of privacy-preserving data sharing technologies from research to practice.
2. Promote applied and translational research that enhances usability and inclusiveness of PPDSA solutions.
3. Develop tool repositories, measurement methods, benchmarking, and testbeds to support the deployment of PETs.

#### Funding Tracks
Proposals are invited in three distinct tracks, each with specific objectives and funding ranges:
- **Track 1**: Focuses on advancing key technologies for practical PPDSA solutions, with budgets ranging from $500K to $1M for up to 2 years.
- **Track 2**: Aims for integrated solutions for trustworthy data sharing in application settings, with budgets from $1M to $1.5M for up to 3 years.
- **Track 3**: Emphasizes the development of usable tools and testbeds for trustworthy sharing of confidential data, with budgets from $500K to $1.5M for up to 3 years.

#### Eligibility
Eligible proposers include:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- U.S.-based small businesses with capabilities in scientific or engineering research.

Principal Investigators (PIs) must hold appointments at eligible organizations, and there are limits on the number of proposals an individual can submit (maximum of two).

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Key components of the proposal include:
- A project justification that aligns with the program's focus on translational research.
- A detailed project management and collaboration plan.
- Letters of collaboration, excluding those from listed partners in the solicitation.

#### Review Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process based on two main criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Each track has additional specific review criteria that focus on the significance of the proposed work, its scalability, and the integration of various technologies.

#### Award Information
The anticipated funding amount for the PDaSP program is $23 million, with an estimated number of awards as follows:
- Up to 12 Track 1 awards.
- Up to 7 Track 2 awards.
- Up to 7 Track 3 awards.

Awards may be in the form of standard or continuing grants, and proposals will be evaluated based on the quality of submissions and availability of funds.

#### Partnerships and Collaboration
The PDaSP program encourages partnerships with industry and federal agencies. Current partners include Intel Corporation, VMware LLC, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These partners may provide co-funding and resources, particularly for projects that align with their interests.

#### Reporting and Award Conditions
Award recipients must comply with NSF's reporting requirements, including annual project reports and a final project outcomes report. Recipients are also required to acknowledge NSF and partner support in publications and reports.

#### Conclusion
The PDaSP program represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the development of privacy-preserving data sharing technologies. By fostering innovative research and collaboration, the program aims to enhance the responsible use of data in various sectors, ultimately benefiting society while safeguarding individual privacy. Proposals are due by September 27, 2024, and interested parties are encouraged to review the full solicitation for detailed guidelines and requirements.
