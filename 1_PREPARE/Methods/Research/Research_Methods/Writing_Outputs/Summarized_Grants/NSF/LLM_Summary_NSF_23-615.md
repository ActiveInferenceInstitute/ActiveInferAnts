### Summary of NSF 23-615: Division of Physics: Investigator-Initiated Research Projects (PHY) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has released the program solicitation NSF 23-615, which invites proposals for investigator-initiated research projects in the field of physics. This solicitation, effective from August 11, 2023, supersedes the previous version (NSF 21-593) and outlines the requirements, deadlines, and guidelines for submitting proposals. The Division of Physics (PHY) aims to support a wide range of physics research and the training of future scientists across various disciplines.

#### Program Description
The PHY supports both experimental and theoretical research across several major subfields, including:
- Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (AMO)
- Elementary Particle Physics
- Gravitational Physics
- Nuclear Physics
- Particle Astrophysics
- Quantum Information Science
- Physics of Living Systems
- Plasma Physics
- Integrative Activities in Physics

The solicitation emphasizes the importance of diversity and encourages Principal Investigators (PIs) to include efforts to broaden participation from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

#### Award Information
- **Type of Award**: Standard Grant, Continuing Grant, or Cooperative Agreement.
- **Estimated Number of Awards**: Approximately 300.
- **Anticipated Funding Amount**: $120 million annually, subject to availability.

#### Eligibility Information
Proposals may be submitted by:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) accredited in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- For-profit organizations with capabilities in scientific research.
- State and local governments, tribal governments, and foreign organizations (limited to U.S. portions of cooperative projects).

There are no restrictions on the number of proposals per organization or PI, although single proposal submissions are encouraged for potential co-review.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
- **Full Proposals**: Must be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov, following the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG).
- **Budgetary Information**: Cost sharing is prohibited, and indirect cost limitations do not apply.
- **Due Dates**: Proposals must be submitted by 5 p.m. local time on specified deadlines, including:
  - November 20, 2023 (Plasma Physics)
  - November 22, 2023 (AMO, Gravitational Physics, LIGO Research Support)
  - December 5, 2023 (Elementary Particle Physics, Particle Astrophysics)
  - December 12, 2023 (Nuclear Physics, Quantum Information Science)

#### Proposal Review Information
Proposals will be evaluated based on two primary merit review criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge within the field.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Additional criteria apply for proposals involving large investments, mid-scale research infrastructure, or long-duration efforts, which may require special reviews and oversight.

#### Award Administration Information
- **Notification of Award**: Successful proposals will receive notification from an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer.
- **Award Conditions**: Awards will include specific provisions and conditions as outlined in the NSF guidelines.
- **Reporting Requirements**: PIs must submit annual project reports and a final project report, detailing accomplishments and outcomes.

#### Important Considerations
- Proposals that deviate from the solicitation requirements may be returned without review.
- PIs are encouraged to consult with program officers prior to submission, especially for large investments or complex proposals.
- The solicitation emphasizes the integration of research and education, as well as the importance of broadening participation in STEM.

#### Agency Contacts
For inquiries, PIs can contact specific program officers listed in the solicitation, who can provide guidance on proposal preparation and submission.

#### Conclusion
The NSF 23-615 solicitation represents a significant opportunity for researchers in the field of physics to secure funding for innovative projects. By adhering to the outlined guidelines and emphasizing diversity and broader impacts, PIs can contribute to the advancement of physics research and the development of a more inclusive scientific community.
