### Summary of NSF 23-615: Division of Physics: Investigator-Initiated Research Projects (PHY) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has released the program solicitation NSF 23-615, which outlines the guidelines for submitting proposals for Investigator-Initiated Research Projects in the Division of Physics (PHY). This solicitation, effective from August 11, 2023, replaces NSF 21-593 and introduces additional requirements for proposal submissions and review criteria. The solicitation emphasizes the importance of diversity in the physics community and encourages proposals that broaden participation from underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

#### Program Description
The Division of Physics supports a wide range of experimental and theoretical research across various subfields, including:
- Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (AMO)
- Elementary Particle Physics
- Gravitational Physics
- Nuclear Physics
- Particle Astrophysics
- Quantum Information Science
- Plasma Physics
- Physics of Living Systems
- Integrative Activities in Physics

The mission of the PHY is to advance fundamental research in physics, enhance workforce preparation, and promote public engagement with science. The solicitation encourages proposals that address significant scientific questions and contribute to the development of new technologies and methodologies.

#### Award Information
- **Type of Award**: Standard Grant, Continuing Grant, or Cooperative Agreement.
- **Estimated Number of Awards**: Approximately 300.
- **Anticipated Funding Amount**: $120 million annually, subject to availability.

#### Eligibility Information
Proposals may be submitted by:
- Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) in the U.S.
- Non-profit organizations associated with educational or research activities.
- For-profit organizations with capabilities in scientific research.
- State and local governments, tribal governments, and foreign organizations (for U.S. portions only).
- There are no restrictions on the number of proposals per organization or Principal Investigator (PI).

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Key points include:
- **Full Proposals**: No letters of intent or preliminary proposals are required.
- **Budgetary Information**: Voluntary committed cost sharing is prohibited. Indirect cost limitations do not apply.
- **Due Dates**: Proposals are due by 5 p.m. local time on specified dates, including November 20, November 22, December 5, and December 12, 2023, depending on the specific program area.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a merit review process, evaluating them based on two primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge in the field.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Additional criteria may apply for proposals involving large investments or long-duration efforts. Proposals may be reviewed through ad hoc reviews, panel reviews, or site visits, with feedback provided to PIs post-review.

#### Special Considerations
- **Diversity**: Proposals should include efforts to enhance diversity within the physics community.
- **Large Investments**: Proposals that require significant funding or span multiple award cycles will undergo additional scrutiny and may involve cooperative agreements with specific oversight conditions.
- **Mid-scale Research Infrastructure**: Proposals requesting funding between $4 million and $30 million must follow a phased development approach and include detailed project planning.

#### Reporting Requirements
PIs must submit annual project reports and a final project report upon completion of the grant. Failure to comply with reporting requirements may affect future funding opportunities.

#### Agency Contacts
The solicitation provides contact information for program officers specializing in various subfields of physics, encouraging PIs to reach out for guidance on proposal suitability and funding opportunities.

#### Conclusion
The NSF 23-615 solicitation outlines a comprehensive framework for submitting proposals for physics research projects, emphasizing the importance of scientific merit, broader impacts, and diversity in the research community. PIs are encouraged to carefully follow the guidelines and deadlines to ensure successful submission and consideration of their proposals.
