### Summary of NSF 24-582: NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer Fast-Track Pilot Programs (SBIR-STTR Fast-Track)

#### Introduction
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs, also known as Americaâ€™s Seed Fund powered by NSF, aim to foster the development of innovative technologies derived from scientific and engineering discoveries that have significant societal and economic potential. This program provides non-dilutive, fixed-amount cooperative agreements to small businesses, facilitating the transition of research from the lab to the market. The Fast-Track initiative allows eligible companies to submit a single proposal encompassing both Phase I and Phase II funding, expediting the funding process.

#### Program Description
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track programs are designed to support small businesses that have a lineage of NSF research funding. To qualify, applicants must demonstrate that their proposed technology stems from prior NSF awards, have at least one Senior/Key Personnel trained in customer discovery, and possess a complete project team at the time of submission. The maximum funding available is $1,555,000, with $400,000 allocated for Phase I and $1,155,000 for Phase II, typically spanning 24 to 36 months.

The program emphasizes the development of technologies that are innovative and have not yet been realized in practice. Innovations must demonstrate a competitive advantage and potential to disrupt existing markets or create new ones. The NSF encourages participation from diverse populations and geographic locations, particularly from socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.

#### Award Information
The anticipated funding amount for the program is approximately $56 million, with around 36 awards expected to be made. The funding is contingent on the availability of resources and the merit of the proposals submitted. 

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible applicants must meet specific criteria:
1. **Project Pitch**: Submit a Project Pitch and receive an official invitation from an NSF Program Officer.
2. **Research Lineage**: The proposed technology must be derived from an active NSF research award or one that was active within the last five years.
3. **Customer Discovery Training**: At least one Senior/Key Personnel must have undergone formal customer discovery training within the last two years.
4. **Complete Team**: All team members must be confirmed and in place at the time of proposal submission.

The program prohibits proposals from entities involved in the production or distribution of Schedule I controlled substances and requires that all R&D be conducted within the United States.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must be submitted through Research.gov, and late submissions will not be accepted. The proposal must include a comprehensive project description, budget, and justification, along with required documentation such as biographical sketches and letters of support. Specific sections of the proposal must address the intellectual merit, broader impacts, and commercialization potential of the proposed technology.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a rigorous merit review process, evaluating both the technical aspects and the potential societal benefits. Reviewers will assess the proposals based on NSF's merit review criteria, which include Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and Commercialization Potential. The review process may involve additional due diligence to clarify any concerns raised during the initial review.

#### Award Administration Information
Award notifications will be made by NSF Grants and Agreements Officers, and recipients must comply with specific reporting requirements, including annual project reports and a final project outcomes report. The funding is contingent upon successful completion of both Phase I and Phase II components, with specific performance targets established at the outset.

#### Important Dates
The full proposal deadlines are as follows:
- September 18, 2024
- November 06, 2024
- March 05, 2025
- July 02, 2025
- November 05, 2025

#### Conclusion
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs represent a significant opportunity for small businesses to secure funding for innovative technologies with the potential for broad societal impact. By streamlining the funding process and emphasizing the importance of customer discovery and team readiness, the NSF aims to enhance the commercialization of groundbreaking scientific and engineering advancements.
