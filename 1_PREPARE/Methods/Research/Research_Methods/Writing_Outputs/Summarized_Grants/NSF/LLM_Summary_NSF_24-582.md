### Summary of NSF 24-582: NSF Small Business Innovation Research / Small Business Technology Transfer Fast-Track Pilot Programs (SBIR-STTR Fast-Track)

#### Introduction
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs, part of America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF, aim to facilitate the transition of scientific and technological innovations from research to market. These programs provide non-dilutive funding to small businesses for the development of technologies with significant societal and economic impacts. This solicitation outlines the eligibility, proposal requirements, and review processes for applicants.

#### Program Description
The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track programs support small businesses in developing technologies derived from prior NSF research awards. The Fast-Track approach allows applicants to submit a single proposal that encompasses both Phase I and Phase II funding, streamlining the transition process. The maximum award amount is $1,555,000, with $400,000 allocated for Phase I and $1,155,000 for Phase II. The expected project duration ranges from 24 to 36 months.

#### Eligibility Information
To be eligible for the Fast-Track programs, small businesses must:
1. Have a lineage of NSF research funding.
2. Include at least one Senior/Key Personnel who has undergone formal customer discovery training.
3. Have a complete team in place at the time of proposal submission.

The lineage requirement stipulates that the proposed innovation must be derived from an active or recently completed NSF award. Customer discovery training must be completed within two years prior to the proposal submission.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must be submitted through Research.gov, and all components must adhere to specific guidelines outlined in the solicitation. Key documents required include:
- Project Summary
- Project Description (10-15 pages)
- Budget and Budget Justification
- Letters of Support (3 required, up to 5 allowed)
- Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (required for STTR proposals)

The proposal must clearly articulate the innovation's technical objectives, commercialization potential, and broader societal impacts.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will be evaluated based on three primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge and overcome technical risks.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential societal benefits and contributions to addressing major challenges.
3. **Commercialization Potential**: The likelihood of successfully bringing the innovation to market.

The review process includes both external merit reviews and internal evaluations by NSF program officers. Proposals that meet the criteria will undergo a due diligence process to assess the company’s structure, personnel, and financial viability.

#### Award Administration Information
Successful applicants will receive fixed amount cooperative agreements, with specific terms and conditions outlined in the award notice. Awardees are required to attend NSF workshops and submit regular progress reports. The funding is contingent upon passing two stage gates during the Phase II transition review.
