### Summary of NIST Suborder 6106.01: Open Source Code Directive

#### Purpose
The directive outlined in NIST Suborder 6106.01 aims to establish requirements that promote the reuse of software code within the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). By making custom-developed Federal source code widely available, the directive supports various NIST programs and enhances efficiency, transparency, and innovation through reusable and open-source software.

#### Applicability
This directive is applicable to all NIST projects that involve the development of custom software intended for production use, which means it is designed to serve users beyond the immediate organization of the developers. However, it excludes software that falls under Section 6 of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-16-21. Importantly, the directive does not impose retroactive requirements on existing custom-developed code, meaning that previously developed software is not mandated to be made available for government-wide reuse or as open-source software.

#### References
The directive is grounded in several legislative and policy frameworks, including:
- National Defense Authorization Act 2015 (FITARA)
- Clinger Cohen Act 1996
- OMB Memorandum 15-14 on Federal Information Technology Management
- OMB Memorandum 16-21 on Federal Source Code Policy

Additionally, it complements a suite of security controls and policies from the Department of Commerce and NIST, ensuring that software development aligns with established security and privacy standards.

#### Definitions
Key definitions provided in the directive include:

- **Custom-Developed Code**: This refers to software produced under a Federal contract or fully funded by the Federal Government, which includes various forms of code such as modules, plugins, and APIs. It excludes exploratory or disposable code.
  
- **Open Source Software (OSS)**: Software that is accessible for use, modification, and sharing by anyone, typically distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation definitions.

- **Source Code**: The human-readable commands written in a programming language that must be compiled or interpreted for execution by a computer.

#### Requirements
The directive outlines several key requirements for projects involving custom-developed code:

1. **Alternatives Analysis**: An appropriate alternatives analysis must be conducted, utilizing the Three-Step Software Solutions Analysis as defined in OMB M-16-21.
   
2. **OSS Release**: At least 20% of newly commissioned custom-developed code must be released as open-source software.

3. **Registration**: All newly commissioned OSS must be registered in the Department of Commerce (DOC) Software Code Inventory.

4. **Documentation**: Newly commissioned custom-developed code must include comprehensive documentation detailing its function, inputs, outputs, and any other relevant information to facilitate reuse.

5. **Rights Acquisition**: Sufficient rights to the newly commissioned custom-developed code must be obtained to meet both government-wide reuse and open-source release objectives.

6. **Noncommercial Treatment**: OSS will not automatically be classified as noncommercial software.

7. **Exemptions**: Exceptions to the requirements can be granted under specific conditions, such as legal restrictions, risks to national security, or other identifiable risks to NISTâ€™s operations. Requests for exemptions must be justified and approved in writing by the NIST Chief Information Officer (CIO).

#### Roles and Responsibilities
The directive delineates specific roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance:

- **Office of the Director**: Responsible for ensuring adherence to the directive across NIST.
  
- **NIST Chief Information Officer**: Tasked with collecting compliance statistics annually and reviewing exemption requests.

- **Office of Information Systems Management**: Assists in identifying reusable code, ensures registration of OSS in the DOC Software Code Inventory, and manages the directive in alignment with Federal and DOC policies.

#### Directive Ownership
The directive is owned by the Office of Information Systems Management, which is responsible for its implementation and oversight.

#### Appendices
The directive includes an appendix detailing the revision history, noting that the initial version was established on November 20, 2018, by Islelly Castillo from the Office of Information Systems Management.

### Conclusion
NIST Suborder 6106.01 serves as a foundational policy for promoting the development and reuse of open-source software within the NIST framework. By establishing clear requirements and responsibilities, the directive aims to enhance the efficiency and transparency of software development while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The emphasis on documentation, rights acquisition, and the potential for exemptions reflects a balanced approach to fostering innovation while safeguarding national interests.
