### Summary of NIST Suborder 6106.01: Open Source Code Directive

#### Purpose
The directive outlined in NIST Suborder 6106.01 aims to establish requirements that promote the reuse of software code by ensuring that custom-developed Federal source code is made widely available across the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This initiative supports various NIST programs and enhances the efficiency and transparency of software development within the federal government.

#### Applicability
This directive is applicable to all NIST projects that involve the development of custom software intended for production use, meaning it will support users beyond the immediate organization of the developers. However, it excludes software that falls under Section 6 of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-16-21. Importantly, the directive does not apply retroactively, meaning existing custom-developed code is not required to be made available for government-wide reuse or as open-source software.

#### References
The directive is grounded in several legislative and policy frameworks, including:
- National Defense Authorization Act 2015 (FITARA)
- Clinger Cohen Act 1996
- OMB Memorandum 15-14 on Federal IT Management
- OMB Memorandum 16-21 on Federal Source Code Policy

Additionally, it complements a suite of security controls from the Department of Commerce and NIST publications, ensuring that software development aligns with established security and privacy standards.

#### Definitions
Key terms defined in the directive include:

- **Custom-Developed Code**: Code produced under a Federal contract or fully funded by the Federal Government, which includes software projects, modules, plugins, scripts, middleware, and APIs. It excludes exploratory or disposable code.
  
- **Open Source Software (OSS)**: Software that is accessible, modifiable, and shareable by anyone, typically distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation definitions.

- **Source Code**: The human-readable commands written in a programming language that must be compiled or interpreted for execution by a computer.

#### Requirements
The directive sets forth several key requirements for the development and release of custom software:

1. **Alternatives Analysis**: An appropriate alternatives analysis must be conducted, incorporating the Three-Step Software Solutions Analysis as defined in OMB M-16-21.

2. **OSS Release**: At least 20% of newly commissioned custom-developed code must be released as OSS.

3. **Registration**: All newly commissioned OSS must be registered in the Department of Commerce (DOC) Software Code Inventory.

4. **Documentation**: Newly commissioned custom-developed code must include comprehensive documentation detailing its function, input/output, and other relevant information for reuse.

5. **Rights Acquisition**: Sufficient rights to the newly commissioned custom-developed code must be obtained to meet both government-wide reuse and open-source release objectives.

6. **OSS Classification**: OSS will not automatically be classified as noncommercial software.

7. **Exemptions**: Exceptions to the requirements can be granted under specific conditions, including legal restrictions, risks to national security or confidentiality, and other identifiable risks to NISTâ€™s operations or mission. Requests for exemptions must be justified and approved in writing by the NIST Chief Information Officer (CIO).

#### Roles and Responsibilities
The directive delineates specific roles and responsibilities to ensure compliance:

- **Office of the Director**: Responsible for ensuring adherence to the directive across NIST.

- **NIST Chief Information Officer (CIO)**: Tasked with collecting annual compliance statistics and reviewing exemption requests.

- **Office of Information Systems Management**: Assists in identifying reusable code, ensures OSS registration in the DOC Software Code Inventory, and manages the directive in alignment with federal policies.

#### Directive Owner
The directive is owned by the Office of Information Systems Management, which is responsible for its implementation and oversight.

#### Appendices
The directive includes an appendix that documents the revision history, noting that the initial version was created on November 20, 2018, by Islelly Castillo from the Office of Information Systems Management.

### Conclusion
NIST Suborder 6106.01 establishes a structured framework for the development and dissemination of custom software within the federal government, emphasizing the importance of software reuse and open-source principles. By mandating the release of a portion of custom-developed code as OSS and ensuring thorough documentation and compliance with federal policies, the directive aims to foster innovation, transparency, and efficiency in government software development practices.
