### Summary of the CHIPS for America Grant Application

#### Introduction

The CHIPS for America program, established under the CHIPS and Science Act signed into law by President Biden on August 9, 2022, aims to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry and enhance the nationâ€™s economic and national security. The program is administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the Department of Commerce, which oversees a total of $50 billion allocated for semiconductor initiatives. Of this amount, $11 billion is designated for research and development (R&D) programs, which are structured into four key areas: the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), the National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP), the Metrology Program, and the Manufacturing USA Program.

#### Funding Opportunities and Notices

The CHIPS for America program has released several Notices of Intent (NOI) and Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFO) to solicit proposals for various R&D activities:

1. **National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP)**:
   - **NOI Date**: July 9, 2024

   - **Prototype Development**: Opportunities for prototype development will also be included.

2. **CHIPS Manufacturing USA Institute**:
   - **NOFO Date**: May 5, 2024
   - **Funding**: Approximately $285 million
   - **Objective**: Establish and operate an institute focused on digital twins for semiconductor manufacturing, aiming to improve manufacturing processes and reduce costs.

3. **Metrology Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)**:
   - **NOFO Date**: April 16, 2024
   - **Funding**: Approximately $54 million
   - **Goal**: Support small businesses in developing innovative measurement services and tools for the semiconductor industry.

4. **Materials and Substrates Research and Development**:
   - **NOFO Date**: February 28, 2024
   - **Funding**: Approximately $300 million
   - **Purpose**: Establish domestic capacity for advanced packaging substrates and materials.

#### Legislative Context and Research Security

The CHIPS and Science Act emphasizes the importance of safeguarding federally funded research and intellectual property (IP) from foreign interference. The National Security Presidential Memorandum-33 (NSPM-33) mandates disclosure requirements for federal funding recipients and the establishment of research security programs. As part of the CHIPS R&D funding applications, applicants must implement research security measures, including:

- Establishing a research security team.
- Assessing at-risk technologies and IP.
- Training personnel on research security.
- Reviewing foreign travel and collaboration requests.
- Implementing cybersecurity and export controls.

#### Objectives of the CHIPS R&D Program

The overarching goals of the CHIPS R&D program include:

1. **Strengthening Supply Chain Resilience**: Reducing risks associated with geographic concentration of suppliers and improving transparency in demand and supply.
2. **Advancing U.S. Technology Leadership**: Encouraging both U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers to increase their presence in the U.S. and fostering innovation within the domestic semiconductor ecosystem.
3. **Supporting Vibrant U.S. Fab Clusters**: Creating ecosystems of suppliers around CHIPS-funded fabrication facilities.
4. **Enhancing National Security**: Ensuring a secure and resilient semiconductor supply chain for critical sectors.

#### Implementation Strategies

To achieve these objectives, the CHIPS for America program will:

- Catalyze private investment in the semiconductor industry.
- Engage with U.S. partners and allies to strengthen the global semiconductor supply chain.
- Build a skilled and diverse workforce through education and training programs.
- Promote operational security through cybersecurity and supply chain security measures.
- Spur regional economic development by fostering inclusive growth across different U.S. regions.

#### Notable Initiatives

1. **National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC)**: A public-private consortium aimed at innovating and solving problems in the semiconductor industry.
2. **Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program (NAPMP)**: Focused on developing advanced packaging technologies that enhance the performance and efficiency of semiconductor devices.
3. **Digital Twins Initiative**: Aiming to leverage digital twin technology to improve semiconductor manufacturing processes and reduce costs.

#### Challenges and Considerations

The CHIPS for America program faces several challenges, including:

- The potential for a subsidy race with other regions, such as the EU's European Chips Act.
- Concerns about protectionist provisions that may impact global trade.
- Balancing the need for domestic production with maintaining global partnerships and supply chains.

#### Conclusion

The CHIPS for America program represents a significant effort to reinvigorate the U.S. semiconductor industry, addressing both immediate manufacturing needs and long-term R&D goals. By focusing on manufacturing incentives, advanced research, workforce development, and national security considerations, the program aims to position the United States as a leader in semiconductor technology and production for years to come. The comprehensive approach taken by the CHIPS for America program is designed to ensure that the U.S. remains competitive in the global semiconductor landscape while safeguarding its economic and national security interests.
