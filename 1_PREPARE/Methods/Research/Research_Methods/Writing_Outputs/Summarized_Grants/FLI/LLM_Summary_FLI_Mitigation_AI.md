# Summary of Grant Application: FLI's New Grants to Oppose and Mitigate AI-Driven Power Concentration

## I. Introduction

The Future of Life Institute (FLI) has initiated a new grants program aimed at addressing the imminent threat posed by the concentration of power due to artificial intelligence (AI) development. With a total funding pool of up to $4 million, the program seeks to support innovative projects that mitigate the risks associated with AI-driven power concentration, which could lead to significant societal and individual disempowerment. The program emphasizes the importance of maintaining meaningful human agency in the face of advancing AI technologies.

## II. Context and Rationale

FLI's concern centers on the unregulated acceleration of AI technologies, which threatens to consolidate power among a select few organizations and individuals. This concentration of power can manifest in various forms, including:

- **Economic Control**: Ownership of significant financial, labor, or material resources.
- **Media Influence**: Control over public attention and media narratives, potentially leading to misinformation and manipulation.
- **Political Authority**: A firm grip on political power that could undermine democratic processes.

The potential consequences of unchecked AI development include the emergence of authoritarian governments utilizing surveillance technologies, monopolistic corporations overshadowing democratic institutions, and the risk of AI systems operating autonomously, leading to human disempowerment or extinction.

## III. Vision for a Better Future

FLI advocates for a reimagining of institutions and technology development to ensure that AI serves humanity positively. The organization envisions a future where AI enhances human agency, fosters innovation, and addresses pressing global challenges. To combat power concentration, FLI calls for the exploration of alternative pathways, including:

- **Public AI**: Development of AI systems with public oversight and accountability.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Strategies to decentralize AI governance while preventing the proliferation of high-risk systems.
- **Open Source Initiatives**: Evaluating the effectiveness of open-source models in mitigating power concentration.

## IV. Focus Areas for Grant Proposals

Proposals submitted under this grant program should address the theme of power concentration and align with FLI's vision. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:

1. **Public AI Development**: Exploring models for AI systems that prioritize public control.
2. **AI Assistants**: Designing AI tools that prioritize individual needs over corporate interests.
3. **Safe Decentralization**: Strategies for decentralized governance of AI systems.
4. **Open Source Effectiveness**: Analyzing the impact of open-source initiatives on power dynamics.
5. **Income Redistribution**: Innovative approaches to address economic disparities exacerbated by AI.
6. **Incentive Structures**: Designing systems that promote equitable benefit distribution.
7. **Infrastructure Development**: Equipping societies to translate AI insights into products that meet human needs.
8. **Legal Frameworks**: Establishing legal mechanisms to address abuses of power in the AI sector.

Proposals that fail to engage with the realities of AI's rapid growth, merely replicate existing mechanisms without innovation, or transfer power to AI systems rather than people will not be considered compelling.

## V. Evaluation Criteria and Eligibility

FLI will award grants ranging from $1 million to $4 million to non-profit institutions, civil society organizations, and academic entities for projects lasting up to three years. The number of grants awarded will depend on the quality of applications received, which will undergo a competitive peer review process. Proposals will be evaluated based on their relevance, expected impact, and innovative approaches to addressing AI-driven power concentration.

Eligible applicants must submit a detailed project proposal, including:

- Contact information and evidence of tax-exempt status.
- A concise project summary and impact statement.
- A statement of the applicant's track record.
- A comprehensive project description (maximum of 8 pages).
- A detailed budget, including justifications.
- Curricula Vitae for senior project personnel.

## VI. Application Process

Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, with two review rounds scheduled for July 30, 2024, and September 15, 2024. The application process requires all proposals to be submitted in English, and international applicants are encouraged to apply. The maximum allowable overhead rate for grant administration is set at 15%.

## VII. Background on FLI

Founded in 2014, the Future of Life Institute is an independent non-profit organization dedicated to steering transformative technology towards beneficial outcomes while mitigating large-scale risks. FLI's focus areas include advanced AI, militarized AI, nuclear risks, bio-risk, and biodiversity preservation. The current grant initiative is part of FLI's broader Futures Program, which aims to realize aspirational futures through sustainable development goals (SDGs) and effective AI governance.

## VIII. Conclusion

FLI's new grants program represents a proactive approach to countering the potential dangers of AI-driven power concentration. By supporting innovative projects that prioritize human agency and equitable power distribution, FLI aims to foster a future where AI technologies serve the broader interests of society rather than a select few. The program invites diverse stakeholders to contribute to this critical dialogue and work towards a more equitable and just technological landscape.
