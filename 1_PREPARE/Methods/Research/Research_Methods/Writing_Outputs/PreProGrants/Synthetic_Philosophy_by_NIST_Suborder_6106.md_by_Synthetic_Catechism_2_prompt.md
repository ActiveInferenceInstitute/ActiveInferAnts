Open Source Code
NIST S 6106.01
Issue Date: 12/06/2018
Effective Date: 12/06/2018
PURPOSE
The purpose of this directive is to define requirements for promoting software code reuse by
making custom-developed Federal source code broadly available across the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in support of NIST programs.
APPLICABILITY
This directive applies to all projects within NIST that commission development of custom
software that will be used in a production capacity (i.e., intended to support a collection of users
outside the developer’s immediate organization), except for software covered under Section 6 of
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-16-21. The requirements outlined
herein do not apply retroactively (i.e., they do not require that existing custom-developed code
be retroactively made available for Government-wide reuse or as open source software.

DEFINITIONS
Custom-Developed Code1
– Custom-developed code is code that is first produced in the
performance of a Federal contract or is otherwise fully funded by the Federal Government,
including code, or segregable portions of code, for which the Government could obtain unlimited
rights under Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Pt. 27 and relevant agency FAR
Supplements. Custom-developed code also includes code developed by agency employees as
part of their official duties. For the purposes of this policy, custom-developed code may include,
but is not limited to, code written for software projects, modules, plugins, scripts, middleware,
and APIs; it does not, however, include code that is truly exploratory or disposable in nature,
such as that written by a developer experimenting with a new language or library.
Open Source Software (OSS) – Software that can be accessed, used, modified, and shared by
anyone. OSS is often distributed under licenses that comply with the definition of "Open Source"
provided by the Open Source Initiative and/or that meet the definition of "Free Software"
provided by the Free Software Foundation.
Source Code – Computer commands written in a computer programming language that is meant
to be read by people. Generally, source code is a higher-level representation of computer
commands as they are written by people and, therefore, must be assembled, interpreted, or
compiled before a computer can execute the code as a program.
REQUIREMENTS
1. An appropriate alternatives analysis will be conducted, incorporating the Three-Step
Software Solutions Analysis in the alternatives analysis process, as defined in section 3 of
OMB M-16-21.
2. At least 20 percent of newly commissioned custom-developed code will be released as
OSS.
3. Newly commissioned custom-developed code which is OSS must be registered in the
Department of Commerce (DOC) Software Code Inventory.
4. Newly commissioned custom-developed code must include documentation that describes
the function, input and output of the module, and any other information relevant to its
reuse.
5. Sufficient rights to newly commissioned custom-developed code to fulfill both the
Government-wide reuse objectives and the open source release objectives will be
obtained.
6. OSS will not automatically be treated as noncommercial software.

1 As defined in Department of Commerce Source Code Policy.
NIST Suborder 6106.01 Ver 1.0 (Uncontrolled Copy in Print) Page 3
7. Exceptions to the requirement defined in this directive may be granted if the following
exemption criteria are met:
a. The sharing of the source code is restricted by law or regulation, including but not
limited to patent or intellectual property law, the Export Asset Regulations, the
International Traffic in Arms Regulation, and the Federal laws and regulations
governing classified information; or
b. The sharing of the source code would create identifiable risk to the detriment of
national security, confidentiality of Government information, or individual privacy;
or
c. The sharing of the source code would create an identifiable risk to the stability,
security, or integrity of NIST’s systems or personnel; or
d. The sharing of the source code would create an identifiable risk to NIST’s mission,
programs, or operations; or
e. The NIST Chief Information Officer (CIO) believes it is in the national interest to
exempt sharing the source code.
8. Exception requests must explain why compliance is unachievable and must be approved
in writing by the NIST CIO.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITES
Office of the Director
• Ensure compliance with the directive across the entire organization.
NIST Chief Information Officer
• Collect statistics on compliance with this directive annually.
• Review and approve exemptions from this directive.
Office of Information Systems Management
• Assist in the determination of what code is reusable.
• Ensure all custom OSS is registered in the DOC Software Code Inventory.
• Manage this directive to ensure alignment with Federal and DOC policies.
