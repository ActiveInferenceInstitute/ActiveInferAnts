- **Visitor Management Systems:** Implementing systems to track and manage visitor access to healthcare facilities, ensuring patient safety and confidentiality.

**Surveillance for Patient Monitoring:**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Utilizing surveillance systems not only for security but also for monitoring patient activities and ensuring safety in high-risk areas, such as intensive care units.
- **AI-Powered Analytics:** Employing AI to analyze patient behavior and detect anomalies that could indicate safety risks.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**Hypothesis 1:**
Integrating physical security measures into healthcare environments will lead to improved patient safety outcomes and higher patient satisfaction.

**Experimental Design:**
Conduct a longitudinal study comparing patient safety metrics and satisfaction scores in hospitals that have implemented enhanced physical security measures versus those that have not.

**Hypothesis 2:**
The application of environmental design principles from physical security will reduce patient anxiety and improve the overall healthcare experience.

**Experimental Design:**
Implement design changes in a clinical setting based on CPTED principles and measure patient anxiety levels and satisfaction before and after the changes.

### 6. New Language and Lexicon

**Glossary of Terms:**
- **Patient Security Measures:** Strategies implemented to protect patients from physical and psychological harm within healthcare environments.
