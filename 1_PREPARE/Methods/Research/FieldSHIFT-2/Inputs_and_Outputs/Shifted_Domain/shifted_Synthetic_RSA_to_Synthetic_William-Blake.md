### Comprehensive Domain Shift from RSA Cryptography to William Blake's Life and Work

#### 1. Deep Analysis of Domain A: RSA Cryptography

**Core Principles and Methodologies:**
- **Public-Key Infrastructure:** RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that relies on a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This duality allows secure communication and digital signatures.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** The security of RSA is based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, specifically the product of two large prime numbers.
- **Key Generation and Management:** The RSA algorithm involves generating a public and private key pair through a series of mathematical operations, including modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** RSA uses modular exponentiation for both encryption (c = m^e mod n) and decryption (m = c^d mod n), where m is the plaintext, c is the ciphertext, e is the public exponent, and d is the private exponent.
- **Hybrid Cryptosystems:** RSA is often used in conjunction with symmetric key algorithms, allowing it to encrypt symmetric keys for bulk data encryption.

**Historical Development and Current Trends:**
- RSA was introduced in 1977 and has undergone various adaptations to enhance security, including increased key sizes and improved padding schemes to defend against attacks.
- The rise of quantum computing poses a potential threat to RSA, prompting research into quantum-resistant algorithms.

#### 2. Thorough Examination of Domain B: William Blake's Life and Work

**Current Paradigms and Challenges:**
- Blake's work is characterized by the interplay of poetry and visual art, emphasizing the importance of imagination and spirituality over rationalism and materialism.
- His philosophy centers around the concept of "contraries," which highlights the coexistence of opposing forces in human experience.
- Blake's critique of societal norms, organized religion, and the dehumanizing effects of industrialization reflects his radical political views and deep spiritual beliefs.

**Gaps and Areas for Innovation:**
- The modern interpretation of Blake often overlooks the mathematical and structural aspects of his art and poetry, which can benefit from a more systematic analysis akin to cryptographic methodologies.
- There is a need to explore Blake’s works through the lens of duality and oppositional forces, similar to the dual keys in RSA cryptography.

#### 3. Isomorphisms Between Domain A and Domain B

**Underlining Structures:**
- **Duality:** The public and private keys in RSA can be compared to Blake's dual themes of innocence and experience, where both aspects are essential for a complete understanding of human nature.
- **Security and Integrity:** Just as RSA ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data through cryptographic methods, Blake's works explore the integrity of the human spirit and the quest for spiritual enlightenment.
- **Complex Systems:** RSA relies on complex mathematical systems, while Blake's art and poetry can be viewed as complex systems of thought that interweave various themes and philosophies.

#### 4. Transposing RSA Elements onto Blake’s Context

**Reimagining Concepts:**
- **Public and Private Vision:** Just as RSA uses a public key for communication, Blake's public works (poetry and art) serve as a means for sharing his visionary experiences, while his private thoughts (letters and unpublished works) reflect his inner struggles and beliefs.
- **Encryption of Meaning:** Blake’s poetry can be seen as an encrypted message that requires interpretation (decryption) to uncover its deeper spiritual truths. Each poem acts as a key that unlocks layers of meaning based on the reader's perspective.
- **Contraries as Cryptographic Keys:** The interplay of contraries in Blake's philosophy mirrors the dual-key system in RSA, where both keys are necessary to unlock the full potential of understanding human experience.

#### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**Emerging Theories:**
- **Blakean Cryptography:** A theoretical framework could be developed that interprets Blake’s work as a form of cryptographic expression, where his imagery and language serve as encoded messages reflecting spiritual truths.
- **Duality in Artistic Expression:** The concept of duality in Blake's work can be formally analyzed using mathematical models derived from RSA, exploring how opposing forces in his poetry and art contribute to a unified vision.

**Experimental Designs:**
- **Comparative Analysis:** A study comparing the interpretation of Blake's poetry through traditional literary analysis versus a cryptographic lens could yield new insights into his work.
- **Visual Encryption:** Creating visual art inspired by Blake’s themes using cryptographic techniques, such as encoding messages within the imagery, could enhance the understanding of both fields.

#### 6. New Language and Lexicon

**Glossary of Terms:**
- **Visionary Encryption:** The process of encoding spiritual truths in artistic forms, akin to encrypting data in RSA.
- **Contrary Keys:** The dual themes in Blake’s work that must be understood together to unlock deeper meanings.
