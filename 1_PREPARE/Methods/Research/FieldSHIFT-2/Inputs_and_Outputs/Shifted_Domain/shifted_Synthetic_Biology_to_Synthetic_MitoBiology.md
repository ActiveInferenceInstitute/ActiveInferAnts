- **Biodiversity:** The variety of life forms contributes to ecosystem resilience and functionality.
- **Keystone Species:** Certain species disproportionately affect ecosystem health and stability.
- **Resilience:** Ecosystems can absorb disturbances and maintain functions.
- **Trophic Cascades:** Changes in one species can ripple through the ecosystem, affecting others.

**2. Examination of Domain B: Mitochondrion**

**Current Paradigms:**
- Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, primarily known for ATP production through cellular respiration.
- Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.
