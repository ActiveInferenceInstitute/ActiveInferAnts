2. **Community-Centric Care:** Shift towards community-based healthcare models that prioritize local knowledge and practices, similar to traditional communal decision-making.
3. **Culturally Competent Care:** Develop frameworks for healthcare providers to respect and integrate traditional healing practices alongside biomedical treatments.

**Challenging Core Assumptions:**
- Move away from a purely biomedical model to one that recognizes the value of traditional healing practices, particularly in chronic disease management and mental health care.
- Redefine patient engagement to include cultural and traditional practices, ensuring that care is relevant and respectful of patients' backgrounds.

### Step 5: Generating Novel Hypotheses and Theories

1. **Hypothesis:** Integrating traditional healing practices into chronic disease management will improve patient outcomes and satisfaction.
   - **Experimental Design:** Conduct a comparative study between patients receiving traditional healing interventions alongside standard care versus those receiving standard care alone.

2. **Theory:** A model of "Culturally Informed Patient-Centered Care" that incorporates traditional knowledge can enhance patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans.
   - **Experimental Design:** Implement a pilot program in diverse communities to evaluate the impact of culturally informed practices on patient experiences and health outcomes.

### Step 6: Developing a New Language and Lexicon

**New Terminology:**
- **Cultural Health Integration (CHI):** The process of incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into healthcare delivery.
- **Holistic Patient Engagement (HPE):** An approach that considers the emotional, spiritual, and cultural dimensions of patient care.
- **Community-Centric Health Systems (CCHS):** Healthcare models that prioritize community involvement and local knowledge.

**Glossary:**
- **Cultural Competence:** The ability of healthcare providers to understand, respect, and integrate diverse cultural practices into care.
- **Traditional Healing Practices:** Non-biomedical health practices rooted in local customs and beliefs, often involving herbal remedies, rituals, and community support.

### Step 7: Comprehensive Research Agenda

**Immediate Research Opportunities:**
- Investigate the effectiveness of integrating traditional healing practices in specific health conditions (e.g., diabetes, mental health).
