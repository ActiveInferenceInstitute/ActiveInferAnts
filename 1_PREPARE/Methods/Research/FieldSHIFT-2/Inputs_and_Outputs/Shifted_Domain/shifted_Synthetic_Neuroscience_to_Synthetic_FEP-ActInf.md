## Domain Shift: Transposing Neuroscience into the Context of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

### 1. Analysis of Domain A: Neuroscience

Neuroscience is a multifaceted field that investigates the structure and function of the nervous system. It encompasses various sub-disciplines, including neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and neurobiology. The core principles of neuroscience include:

- **Neural Networks**: The brain consists of interconnected networks of neurons that process and transmit information. These networks are dynamic and can exhibit plasticity, allowing for learning and adaptation.
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: This refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, which is crucial for learning and memory. Mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are key processes in synaptic plasticity.
- **Neurotransmission**: Neurons communicate through neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers that transmit signals across synapses. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is essential for proper neural function.
- **Neurogenesis**: The formation of new neurons occurs in specific brain regions, contributing to learning and memory.
- **Neural Oscillations**: Rhythmic patterns of neural activity play a role in various cognitive processes, including attention, perception, and consciousness.
- **Glial Cells**: These non-neuronal cells provide support, protection, and nourishment to neurons, playing critical roles in maintaining brain homeostasis.

### 2. Examination of Domain B: Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that all adaptive systems minimize their variational free energy to maintain structural and functional integrity. Key components include:

- **Predictive Processing**: The brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on prediction errors.
- **Active Inference**: Organisms act to confirm their predictions, minimizing surprise and uncertainty in their environment.
- **Markov Blankets**: These define boundaries between an organism and its environment, allowing for selective interaction while maintaining internal states.
- **Variational Free Energy**: This measure reflects the difference between an organism's internal model and the actual state of the world, serving as a proxy for surprise.

### 3. Isomorphisms Between Neuroscience and the Free Energy Principle

Several isomorphisms exist between the principles of neuroscience and the FEP:

- **Neural Plasticity and Model Updating**: Just as synaptic plasticity allows for the strengthening or weakening of connections based on experience, the updating of generative models in the FEP reflects a similar adaptability in response to new information.
  
- **Neurotransmission and Prediction Errors**: The role of neurotransmitters in modulating neuronal excitability parallels how prediction errors drive updates in generative models, influencing behavior and perception.

- **Neural Oscillations and Hierarchical Processing**: The organization of neural oscillations can be viewed as a form of hierarchical processing, similar to how the FEP describes the brain's predictive coding structure.

- **Glial Support and Homeostatic Regulation**: Glial cells maintain neuronal health and function, akin to how the FEP emphasizes the importance of homeostatic processes in minimizing free energy.

### 4. Transposing Neuroscience into the Free Energy Principle

The transposition of neuroscience into the context of the FEP involves reimagining how neural mechanisms can inform and enhance our understanding of predictive processing and active inference:

- **Neural Networks as Generative Models**: The intricate networks of neurons can be viewed as generative models that predict sensory input and guide actions. Each neural network can be seen as a localized model that contributes to the broader predictive framework of the brain.

- **Synaptic Plasticity as Model Adaptation**: The mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (LTP and LTD) can be reinterpreted as processes that refine and update generative models in response to prediction errors, enhancing learning and adaptation.

- **Neurotransmitters as Modulators of Prediction Errors**: The role of neurotransmitters in facilitating or inhibiting neural activity can be seen as influencing the magnitude of prediction errors, thus affecting the efficiency of model updating.

- **Neural Oscillations as Temporal Coding**: Oscillatory activity in neural circuits can be conceptualized as a temporal coding mechanism that enhances the precision of predictions and the timing of updates in response to sensory input.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

From this transposition, several novel hypotheses emerge:

- **Hypothesis 1**: Neural circuits that exhibit greater synaptic plasticity will demonstrate enhanced predictive accuracy in generative models, leading to more effective active inference strategies.

- **Hypothesis 2**: Variability in neurotransmitter levels will correlate with the efficiency of prediction error resolution, influencing the speed and accuracy of model updates.

- **Hypothesis 3**: The presence of specific neural oscillation patterns will facilitate the integration of multisensory information, improving the coherence of generative models and enhancing perceptual accuracy.

### 6. New Language and Lexicon

To effectively communicate the transposed concepts, a new lexicon is proposed:

- **Generative Neural Network (GNN)**: A neural network that functions as a generative model, continuously predicting and updating based on sensory input.
- **Plasticity-Driven Prediction (PDP)**: The process by which synaptic plasticity enhances the accuracy of predictions in a generative model.
- **Neurotransmitter Modulation of Prediction Errors (NMPE)**: The influence of neurotransmitter levels on the resolution of prediction errors and model updating.
- **Oscillatory Temporal Coding (OTC)**: The role of neural oscillations in synchronizing the timing of predictions and updates in response to sensory input.

### 7. Comprehensive Research Agenda

A long-term research agenda could include:

- **Immediate Research Opportunities**: Investigate the relationship between synaptic plasticity and predictive accuracy in animal models, focusing on the role of neurotransmitters in this process.
