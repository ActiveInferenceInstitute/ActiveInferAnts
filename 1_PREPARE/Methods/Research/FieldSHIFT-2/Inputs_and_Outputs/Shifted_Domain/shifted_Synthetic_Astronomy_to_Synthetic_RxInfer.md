- **Data Analysis:** Employing statistical methods to interpret vast amounts of data collected from observations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Cosmic Phenomena:** Understanding the lifecycle of stars, formation of galaxies, and the nature of black holes.
- **Cosmology:** Studying the universe's origin, evolution, and structure.
- **Astrobiology:** Exploring the potential for life beyond Earth, including the study of exoplanets.

**Historical Development:**
Astronomy has evolved from early naked-eye observations to sophisticated space-based telescopes and advanced computational models. Key milestones include the invention of the telescope, the formulation of Kepler's laws, and the development of the Big Bang theory.
