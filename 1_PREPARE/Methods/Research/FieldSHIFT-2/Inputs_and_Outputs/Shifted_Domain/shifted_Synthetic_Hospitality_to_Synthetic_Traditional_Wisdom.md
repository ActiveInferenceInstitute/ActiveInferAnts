### Comprehensive Domain Shift: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Traditional Knowledge

#### 1. Deep Analysis of Domain A: Guest Experience
The guest experience in hospitality is centered around creating memorable interactions and impressions throughout a guest's journey. Key principles include:
- **Personalization**: Tailoring experiences to individual preferences.
