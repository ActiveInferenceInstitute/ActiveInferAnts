### 3. Isomorphisms Between Domains A and B

**Underlying Structures:**
- **Surveillance and Observation:** Just as physical security uses surveillance systems to monitor for threats, astronomy uses telescopes and sensors to observe celestial phenomena.
- **Access Control and Data Access:** In physical security, access control systems regulate who can enter sensitive areas; in astronomy, data access controls manage who can analyze and interpret astronomical data.
- **Risk Assessment and Threat Detection:** Both domains require assessing risks—physical security assesses vulnerabilities to threats, while astronomy assesses risks related to cosmic events (e.g., potential asteroid impacts).

**Conceptual Models:**
- **Defense in Depth:** In physical security, multiple layers of protection are used; similarly, astronomical research employs multiple observational techniques (e.g., optical, radio, and gravitational wave observations) to obtain a comprehensive understanding of cosmic phenomena.

### 4. Transposing Elements of Domain A onto Domain B

**Reimagined Framework:**
- **Celestial Security Systems:** Implementing a "security" framework for celestial bodies, where monitoring systems (analogous to surveillance) are used to track asteroids, comets, and other potentially hazardous objects.
  
- **Access Control for Space Data:** Developing robust access control systems for astronomical databases, ensuring that only authorized researchers can access sensitive data related to exoplanets or cosmic events.

- **Environmental Design in Astronomy:** Applying CPTED principles to the design of observatories and research facilities, ensuring that they are situated in locations that minimize light pollution and maximize observational capabilities.

- **Risk Assessment for Cosmic Events:** Establishing protocols to assess risks associated with cosmic phenomena, including supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and developing contingency plans for potential impacts on Earth.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**Hypothesis 1: "Celestial Intrusion Detection"**

- **Experimental Design:** Deploy a network of telescopes equipped with advanced analytics to monitor NEOs and assess their potential impact on Earth.

**Hypothesis 2: "Astro-Access Control"**
- **Theory:** The principles of access control can be applied to data management in astronomy, leading to enhanced security protocols for sensitive astronomical data.
- **Experimental Design:** Implement a multi-factor authentication system for accessing large astronomical databases, testing its effectiveness in protecting against data breaches.

**Hypothesis 3: "Cosmic Environmental Design"**
