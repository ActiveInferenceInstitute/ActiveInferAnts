## Domain Shift: Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Applied to Neuroscience

### 1. Deep Analysis of Domain A: Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems strive to minimize their variational free energy, which can be understood as a measure of surprise or prediction error. This principle is grounded in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, suggesting that living organisms maintain their integrity and functionality by reducing the discrepancy between their internal models of the world and actual environmental conditions. 

**Core Principles:**
- **Variational Free Energy:** A mathematical representation of the difference between an organism's predictions and the actual state of the world.
- **Active Inference:** The process by which organisms act to confirm their predictions and minimize surprise, thus reducing free energy.
- **Predictive Coding:** A framework where the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs, updating these predictions based on incoming data.

**Methodologies:**
- Bayesian inference is a central methodology, allowing systems to update their beliefs based on new evidence.
- Hierarchical modeling, where higher levels of a model encapsulate more abstract concepts, plays a critical role in understanding perception and cognition.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Markov Blankets:** These define the boundaries between an organism and its environment, allowing selective interaction while maintaining internal states.
- **Generative Models:** Internal representations that predict sensory inputs and guide actions.

**Historical Development and Current Trends:**
The FEP has evolved from early thermodynamic theories to encompass cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with applications in understanding perception, action, and learning.

### 2. Examination of Domain B: Neuroscience

Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, encompassing its structure, function, development, and pathology. It involves various methodologies, including electrophysiological recordings, neuroimaging, and molecular biology techniques.

**Current Paradigms:**
- Neural networks and synaptic plasticity as fundamental mechanisms of learning and memory.
- The role of neurotransmitters in modulating behavior and cognition.
- Understanding neurodegenerative diseases and their impact on neural circuits.

**Challenges:**
- Integrating findings across multiple scales, from molecular to behavioral.
- Addressing the complexity of neural circuits and their dynamic interactions.
- Bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications.

### 3. Isomorphisms Between Domain A and Domain B

- **Minimization of Variational Free Energy and Neural Plasticity:** Just as organisms minimize free energy to adapt to their environment, neural circuits exhibit plasticity to optimize their responses to stimuli.
- **Active Inference and Decision-Making:** The process of making predictions and acting on them parallels how neurons integrate sensory information and modulate responses.
- **Generative Models and Neural Representations:** Both domains utilize internal models to predict and interpret external inputs, whether in the brain or in broader biological systems.

### 4. Transposition of Fundamental Elements

By applying the FEP to neuroscience, we can reframe our understanding of neural processes:

- **Neural Networks as Predictive Models:** Neural networks can be viewed as generative models that predict sensory input and adapt through synaptic plasticity to minimize prediction errors.
- **Synaptic Plasticity as Free Energy Minimization:** Learning in the brain can be conceptualized as a process of minimizing variational free energy through the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections based on experience.
- **Decision-Making as Active Inference:** The brain's decision-making processes can be seen as active inference, where actions are taken to confirm predictions and reduce uncertainty.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

- **Neural Free Energy Models:** Develop models that quantify the variational free energy in neural circuits, allowing for predictions about synaptic changes during learning.
