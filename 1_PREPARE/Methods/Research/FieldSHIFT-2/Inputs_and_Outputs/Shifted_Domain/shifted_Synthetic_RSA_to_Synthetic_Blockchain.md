### Domain Shift from RSA Cryptography to Blockchain

#### 1. Deep Analysis of Domain A: RSA Cryptography

**Core Principles:**
- **Public-Key Infrastructure:** RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that relies on a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, particularly the product of two large prime numbers.
- **Modular Arithmetic:** RSA employs modular exponentiation for both encryption and decryption processes.
- **Digital Signatures:** RSA can be used for creating and verifying digital signatures, ensuring data integrity and authenticity.

**Methodologies:**
- **Key Generation:** Involves selecting two large prime numbers, computing their product (modulus), and determining the public and private exponents.
- **Encryption/Decryption Operations:** The encryption operation is defined as \( c = m^e \mod n \) and decryption as \( m = c^d \mod n \).

**Historical Development:**
- Introduced in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA was one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and has influenced subsequent cryptographic protocols.

**Current Trends:**
- Increasing key sizes for enhanced security, the development of hybrid cryptographic systems, and the exploration of post-quantum cryptography to counter potential vulnerabilities posed by quantum computers.

**Unique Perspectives:**
