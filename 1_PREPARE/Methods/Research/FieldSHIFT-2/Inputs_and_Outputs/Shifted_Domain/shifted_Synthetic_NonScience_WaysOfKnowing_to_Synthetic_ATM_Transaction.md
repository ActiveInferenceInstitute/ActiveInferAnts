**Experimental Designs:**
- **User Testing:** Conduct A/B testing comparing traditional ATM interfaces with narrative-driven designs to measure user satisfaction and transaction completion rates.
- **Cultural Studies:** Analyze user engagement metrics for ATMs with culturally tailored interfaces versus generic ones across different demographic groups.
- **Emotional Response Tracking:** Use biometric sensors to measure user stress levels during transactions with standard versus emotionally intelligent interfaces.

### 6. Developing a New Language and Lexicon

**New Terms:**
- **Narrative Interface:** An ATM interface that incorporates storytelling elements to guide users through transactions.
- **Cultural Adaptability:** The ability of an ATM to adjust its interface and interactions based on the cultural context of the user.
- **Emotional Responsiveness:** The capacity of an ATM to respond to user emotions, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Glossary:**
- **Narrative Interface:** A design approach that incorporates storytelling elements into user interactions.
- **Cultural Adaptability:** The feature of an ATM that allows it to resonate with users from diverse cultural backgrounds through tailored language and symbols.
- **Emotional Responsiveness:** The ability of an ATM to adapt its responses based on user emotional cues.
