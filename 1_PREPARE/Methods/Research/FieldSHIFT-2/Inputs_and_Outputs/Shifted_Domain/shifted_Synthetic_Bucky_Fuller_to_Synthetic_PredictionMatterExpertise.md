### Comprehensive Domain Shift: From Buckminster Fuller to Prediction Matter Expertise

---

### 1. Analysis of Domain A: Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller was a visionary whose work spanned architecture, design, systems theory, and futurism. His core principles include:

- **Holistic Thinking**: Fuller emphasized the interconnectedness of systems, advocating for a comprehensive approach to problem-solving that considers the entire ecosystem rather than isolated components.
- **Ephemeralization**: The idea of doing more with less through technological advancement. Fuller believed that innovations could lead to sustainable abundance.
- **Synergetics**: This concept explores how complex systems behave in ways that cannot be predicted by analyzing their parts in isolation. It focuses on emergent properties and the geometry of relationships within systems.
- **Tensegrity**: A structural principle that combines isolated components under compression with a continuous network of tension, allowing for lightweight, strong, and flexible structures.
- **Spaceship Earth**: Fuller coined this term to describe the planet as a finite resource requiring careful management and sustainable practices.
- **World Game**: A concept aimed at optimizing global resource distribution for the benefit of all humanity, emphasizing collective problem-solving.

Fuller's influence extends into sustainable design, systems thinking, and the promotion of a design science revolution aimed at addressing global challenges.

### 2. Examination of Domain B: Prediction Matter Expertise

Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) focuses on the ability to synthesize knowledge from various fields to make informed predictions and decisions. Key aspects include:
