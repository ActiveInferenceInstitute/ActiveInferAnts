To transpose concepts from neuroscience (Domain A) into the context of negotiation (Domain B), we will create a transformative framework that integrates neural principles into negotiation strategies, enhancing understanding and practice in negotiation. This will be achieved through a structured approach that highlights isomorphisms, reimagines negotiation concepts, and generates innovative hypotheses.

### 1. Deep Analysis of Domain A (Neuroscience)

**Core Principles and Concepts:**
- **Neural Networks:** Complex interconnected systems that process and transmit information.
- **Synaptic Plasticity:** The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time based on activity.
- **Neurotransmitters:** Chemical messengers that transmit signals and influence behavior.
- **Neurogenesis:** The formation of new neurons, which can enhance cognitive functions.
- **Glial Cells:** Supportive cells that regulate neuronal function and maintain homeostasis.
- **Neural Oscillations:** Rhythmic patterns of neural activity associated with cognitive processes.

### 2. Examination of Domain B (Negotiation)

**Current Paradigms:**
- Negotiation is a dialogue aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
- Effective negotiation relies on skills such as active listening, preparation, and emotional management.
- Strategies include win-win, compromise, and integrative approaches.

**Challenges:**
- Power imbalances can skew negotiations.
- Cultural differences may lead to misunderstandings.
- Emotional dynamics can escalate conflicts.

### 3. Identify Isomorphisms

- **Neural Networks ↔ Negotiation Networks:** Just as neurons form networks to process information, negotiators form networks of relationships and communication pathways to navigate discussions.
- **Synaptic Plasticity ↔ Negotiation Adaptability:** The ability to adapt strategies and approaches in negotiation mirrors synaptic plasticity, where responses are adjusted based on interactions.
- **Neurotransmitters ↔ Communication Signals:** Just as neurotransmitters influence behavior, communication signals (verbal and non-verbal) in negotiation can shape outcomes.
- **Neurogenesis ↔ Skill Development:** The formation of new neurons parallels the development of new negotiation skills through practice and experience.

### 4. Systematic Transposition of Elements

- **Neural Networks in Negotiation:** Understanding negotiation as a dynamic network of interactions can help negotiators visualize their roles and the influence of relationships. For example, using network analysis to identify key stakeholders can enhance strategy formulation.
  
- **Synaptic Plasticity in Negotiation:** Negotiators can employ adaptive strategies that allow them to adjust their approaches based on the responses of the other party, akin to how synapses strengthen or weaken. Techniques such as active listening and feedback loops can facilitate this adaptability.

- **Neurotransmitter Influence:** Just as neurotransmitters affect mood and behavior, negotiators can be trained to recognize and modulate their emotional responses and those of others, using techniques like emotional intelligence and empathy to enhance rapport and cooperation.

- **Neurogenesis and Skill Acquisition:** Encouraging continuous learning and skill development in negotiation parallels neurogenesis. Workshops and role-playing can be seen as 'exercises' that promote the growth of new negotiation strategies and competencies.

### 5. Generate Novel Hypotheses

- **Hypothesis 1:** Negotiators who actively engage in adaptive strategies (akin to synaptic plasticity) will achieve better outcomes than those who rely on fixed tactics.
  
- **Hypothesis 2:** The ability to recognize and manage emotional signals (analogous to neurotransmitter effects) will correlate with higher success rates in negotiations.

- **Hypothesis 3:** Continuous training and practice in negotiation skills (reflective of neurogenesis) will lead to enhanced performance over time, particularly in complex or high-stakes negotiations.

### 6. Develop a New Lexicon

- **Negotiation Networks:** The interconnected relationships and communication channels among negotiators.
  
- **Adaptive Negotiation:** The ability to adjust strategies dynamically based on feedback and interactions.

- **Emotional Modulation:** The process of managing one’s own emotions and recognizing the emotional states of others to facilitate negotiation.

- **Skill Neurogenesis:** The ongoing development of negotiation skills through practice and experience.

### 7. Outline a Research Agenda

- Investigate the impact of adaptive negotiation strategies on outcomes across different contexts (business, diplomacy, etc.).
  
- Explore the role of emotional intelligence in negotiation effectiveness, comparing negotiators with varying levels of emotional awareness.

- Study the effects of continuous training on negotiation performance, particularly in high-pressure situations.

### 8. Revolutionizing Education in Negotiation

- **Interdisciplinary Curriculum:** Integrate neuroscience principles into negotiation training programs, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, emotional intelligence, and network dynamics.

- **New Pedagogical Approaches:** Utilize simulation exercises that mimic neural processes, allowing students to practice adaptive negotiation techniques in real-time.

- **Essential Skills:** Focus on developing skills related to emotional modulation, active listening, and network analysis.

### 9. Identify Technological Innovations

- **AI-Powered Negotiation Tools:** Develop software that analyzes negotiation styles and emotional cues using neural network algorithms, providing real-time feedback to negotiators.

- **Virtual Reality Training:** Create immersive training environments that simulate negotiation scenarios, allowing practitioners to practice adaptive strategies and emotional management.

### 10. Address Resistance and Limitations

- **Potential Resistance:** Traditional negotiators may resist new approaches that challenge established practices. To counter this, provide empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of adaptive strategies.

- **Limitations:** Some may argue that negotiation is too context-dependent for a one-size-fits-all model. Address this by advocating for flexibility within the proposed framework, allowing negotiators to tailor strategies to specific situations.

### 11. Propose Interdisciplinary Collaborations

- Collaborate with neuroscientists to conduct empirical studies on negotiation dynamics, exploring the neural correlates of effective negotiation strategies.

- Partner with psychologists to develop training programs that incorporate emotional intelligence and adaptability into negotiation practice.

### 12. Construct a Compelling Narrative

This transformative framework reimagines negotiation through the lens of neuroscience, offering a fresh perspective on how negotiators can enhance their effectiveness. By understanding negotiation as a dynamic network influenced by emotional and cognitive processes, practitioners can develop adaptive strategies that lead to more successful outcomes. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the field of negotiation but also opens avenues for innovative research, training, and technology, ultimately revolutionizing how we engage in dialogue and conflict resolution. 

In conclusion, the integration of neuroscience principles into negotiation practices can lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities of human interaction, fostering more effective, empathetic, and successful negotiators.
