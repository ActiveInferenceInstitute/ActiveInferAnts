- **Emergent Narrative Structures:** Design games that allow for emergent storytelling, where player choices and interactions dynamically shape the narrative, reflecting Fuller's vision of collaborative problem-solving.
- **Tensegrity Mechanics:** Develop game mechanics that emphasize flexibility and adaptability, allowing players to approach challenges in multiple ways while maintaining a balanced gameplay experience.

#### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

- **Hypothesis 1:** Games designed with a holistic framework will yield higher player engagement and satisfaction compared to traditional linear designs.
  - **Experimental Design:** Create two versions of a game—one with a holistic design approach and one with a traditional design. Measure player engagement, satisfaction, and retention rates.
  
- **Hypothesis 2:** Implementing sustainable practices in game development will enhance brand loyalty and player community engagement.
  - **Experimental Design:** Survey players on their perceptions of brands that prioritize sustainability versus those that do not, measuring loyalty and community involvement.
  
- **Hypothesis 3:** Emergent narratives will lead to greater player investment in game worlds compared to pre-scripted narratives.
  - **Experimental Design:** Compare player immersion and emotional responses in games with emergent versus linear narratives through qualitative interviews and gameplay analytics.

#### 6. New Language and Lexicon
