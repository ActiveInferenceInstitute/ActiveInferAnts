- **Healing Environment Design Model:** Guidelines for designing healthcare facilities that prioritize patient comfort, emotional well-being, and recovery, inspired by successful hospitality environments.

### 6. Developing a New Lexicon

- **Patient Experience Personalization (PEP):** Similar to guest experience personalization, focusing on tailoring healthcare services to individual patient needs.
- **Care Quality Assurance (CQA):** A term denoting the continuous improvement of service quality in healthcare, akin to service quality in hospitality.
- **Healing Environment Servicescape (HES):** The physical and emotional atmosphere of healthcare facilities that influences patient perceptions.
- **Sustainable Healthcare Practices (SHP):** Initiatives that reflect a commitment to environmental stewardship within healthcare settings.

### 7. Research Agenda

- **Exploring Personalization in Patient Care:** Investigate how personalized care plans impact patient satisfaction and health outcomes.

- **Evidence-Based Justification:** Present data and case studies demonstrating the positive impact of enhanced patient experiences on health outcomes and satisfaction.
- **Gradual Implementation:** Propose a phased approach to integrating hospitality principles, allowing time for adaptation and training.

### 11. Interdisciplinary Collaborations

- **Partnerships with Hospitality Experts:** Collaborate with hospitality professionals to develop training programs and service quality standards for healthcare.
- **Joint Research Initiatives:** Establish research projects that explore the intersection of patient experience and hospitality practices.
- **Community Engagement Programs:** Work with local organizations to promote health and wellness initiatives that reflect sustainable practices.

### 12. Compelling Narrative

By transposing the principles of guest experience from hospitality into the realm of healthcare, we can fundamentally alter the patient experience landscape. This innovative framework emphasizes personalization, service quality, and the physical environment, resulting in a holistic approach to patient care. As healthcare evolves, integrating these transformative ideas will not only enhance patient satisfaction but also promote better health outcomes, ultimately revolutionizing the way we perceive and deliver healthcare services. The time has come for healthcare to embrace the best practices of hospitality, creating a new paradigm where patient experiences are prioritized alongside clinical excellence.
