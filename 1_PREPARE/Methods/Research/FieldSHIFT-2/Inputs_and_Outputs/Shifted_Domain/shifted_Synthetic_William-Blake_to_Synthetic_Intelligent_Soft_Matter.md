Both domains challenge traditional boundaries—Blake between art and literature, and intelligent soft matter between material science and engineering.

#### 4. Systematic Transposition of Domain A onto Domain B

**Reimagining Intelligent Soft Matter:**
By applying Blake's principles, intelligent soft matter can be envisioned as a material that not only responds to stimuli but also embodies a narrative or poetic quality. For instance, materials could be designed to reflect the dualities of human experience, such as materials that change color or shape based on emotional or environmental cues, creating a dialogue between the material and its context.

**Challenging Core Assumptions:**
Traditional views of materials as passive entities can be transformed to see them as active participants in their environment, akin to Blake’s characters that embody complex human emotions and experiences.

#### 5. Generating Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**New Hypotheses:**
- Intelligent soft materials can be designed to express emotional states, responding to human interaction in ways that reflect Blake's exploration of the human condition.
- The integration of narrative elements into the design of intelligent materials can enhance user engagement and emotional connection.

**Experimental Designs:**
- Develop soft materials that change properties based on user interactions, such as color-changing textiles that respond to touch or temperature, creating a sensory experience that embodies Blake’s dualities.

#### 6. Developing a New Lexicon

**Glossary of Terms:**
- **Imaginative Materiality:** Materials designed to express emotional or narrative qualities.
- **Responsive Poetics:** The study of how materials can narrate human experiences through their responsive behaviors.
- **Dual Functionality:** The ability of a material to embody and express opposing properties (e.g., flexible yet strong).

#### 7. Comprehensive Research Agenda

**Immediate Research Opportunities:**
- Investigate the emotional responses elicited by intelligent soft materials in various contexts (e.g., art installations, therapeutic environments).
- Explore the integration of narrative elements into the design process of intelligent materials.
