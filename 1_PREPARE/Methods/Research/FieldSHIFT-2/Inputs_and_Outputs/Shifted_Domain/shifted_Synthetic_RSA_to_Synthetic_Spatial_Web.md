### Comprehensive Domain Shift: Transposing RSA Cryptography into the Context of the Spatial Web

#### 1. Deep Analysis of RSA Cryptography

**Core Principles and Methodologies:**
- **Public-Key Infrastructure:** RSA operates on the principle of asymmetric cryptography, where two keys (public and private) are used for secure communication. The public key can be shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** The security of RSA is based on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, specifically the product of two large prime numbers.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** RSA employs modular exponentiation for both encryption and decryption processes, ensuring that only someone with the private key can access the original message.
- **Digital Signatures:** RSA also provides a mechanism for digital signatures, allowing for authentication and integrity verification of messages.

**Historical Development:**
- Introduced in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA was one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems. Over the years, it has evolved to incorporate larger key sizes and advanced padding schemes to enhance security.

**Current Trends:**
- RSA remains widely used in various applications, including secure web browsing (SSL/TLS), email encryption (PGP), and secure remote access (SSH). However, it faces challenges from quantum computing and the need for efficient key management.
