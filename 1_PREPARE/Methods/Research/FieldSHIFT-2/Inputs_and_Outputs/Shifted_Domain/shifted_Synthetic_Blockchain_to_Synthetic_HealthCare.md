- **Patient Identity Management:** A blockchain solution for secure identity verification that allows patients to control access to their health information, reducing identity theft risks.
- **Interoperable Health Data Ecosystem:** Creating a network of interoperable blockchains that facilitate data sharing between different healthcare providers, ensuring seamless care coordination.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

- **Hypothesis 1:** Implementing blockchain for patient record management will significantly reduce administrative costs and improve care coordination.
  - **Experimental Design:** Pilot a blockchain-based EHR system in a hospital and measure outcomes against traditional systems in terms of cost, time, and patient satisfaction.

- **Hypothesis 2:** Smart contracts can enhance patient adherence to treatment plans by automating reminders and follow-ups based on patient-specific conditions.
  - **Experimental Design:** Develop a smart contract system for chronic disease management and measure adherence rates compared to standard follow-up methods.

### 6. New Language and Lexicon

- **HealthChain:** A blockchain-based system for managing health records.
- **PatientToken:** A digital representation of patient consent and identity on the blockchain.
- **CareSmart Contract:** A self-executing contract that automates healthcare processes such as consent and billing.
- **Interoperable Health Network (IHN):** A network of blockchain systems that allows seamless data sharing across healthcare providers.

### 7. Comprehensive Research Agenda

- **Immediate Research Opportunities:**
  - Investigate the feasibility of blockchain-based EHR systems in various healthcare settings.
  - Assess patient perspectives on data ownership and privacy in blockchain implementations.

- **Long-Term Directions:**
