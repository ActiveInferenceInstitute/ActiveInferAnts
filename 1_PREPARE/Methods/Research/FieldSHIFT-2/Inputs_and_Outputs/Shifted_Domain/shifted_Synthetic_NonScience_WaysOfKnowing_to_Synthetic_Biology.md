### 2. Examination of Biology and Ecosystems (Domain B)

**Current Paradigms**:
- Biology and ecosystem studies traditionally rely on empirical data and the scientific method to understand life processes, interactions, and environmental dynamics.
- Key challenges include biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, and the need for sustainable practices in resource management.

**Gaps and Limitations**:
- Often, biological studies overlook the subjective human experience and cultural context, which can limit the effectiveness of conservation strategies.
- There is a need for innovative approaches to address complex ecological challenges that are not solely data-driven.

### 3. Identifying Isomorphisms Between Domains A and B

**Underlying Structures**:
- Both domains recognize the importance of interconnectedness: ecosystems are complex networks where species interact with one another and their environment, similar to how non-science ways of knowing emphasize the interconnectedness of life experiences and cultural narratives.

**Processes and Theoretical Frameworks**:
- The concept of resilience in ecosystems can be paralleled with the resilience found in non-science ways of knowing, such as community healing practices that draw on cultural wisdom.
- The role of narratives in shaping understanding in both domains, where storytelling can be a powerful tool for both biological education and ecological conservation.

### 4. Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing onto Biology and Ecosystems

**Reimagining Biological Frameworks**:
- Integrate holistic approaches from non-science ways of knowing to redefine ecological research. This could involve viewing ecosystems not just as collections of species but as living entities with their own narratives and histories.
- Emphasize experiential learning in biology education, where students engage in hands-on, community-based projects that incorporate local ecological knowledge.

**Challenging Core Assumptions**:
- The assumption that empirical data is the sole basis for understanding ecological dynamics can be challenged by incorporating indigenous knowledge and local narratives, which provide valuable insights into ecosystem functioning.

### 5. Generating Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**Hypotheses**:
- **Hypothesis 1**: Incorporating indigenous ecological knowledge into biodiversity conservation strategies will enhance ecosystem resilience and recovery.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Artistic expression and storytelling can improve public engagement with ecological issues, leading to more effective conservation efforts.

**Experimental Designs**:
