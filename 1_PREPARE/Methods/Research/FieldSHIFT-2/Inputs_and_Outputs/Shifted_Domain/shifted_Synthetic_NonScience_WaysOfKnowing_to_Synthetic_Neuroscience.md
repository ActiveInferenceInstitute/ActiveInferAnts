### 3. Identifying Isomorphisms Between Domains A and B

Several isomorphisms can be identified between non-science ways of knowing and neuroscience:

- **Holistic Understanding**:
  - Both domains recognize the interconnectedness of various systems. Non-science ways of knowing emphasize holistic perspectives, while neuroscience increasingly acknowledges the importance of neural networks and their interactions.

- **Role of Experience**:
  - Non-science ways of knowing value personal experience and intuition, akin to how experiential learning and neuroplasticity are recognized in neuroscience.

- **Narrative and Meaning**:
  - Both domains utilize narratives to convey complex ideas. Neuroscience can benefit from storytelling to communicate findings and engage broader audiences.

### 4. Transposing Elements of Domain A onto Domain B

Transposing non-science ways of knowing into neuroscience can fundamentally reshape how we approach the field:

- **Integrative Framework**:
  - Develop a framework that incorporates intuitive and experiential knowledge alongside empirical research, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of neural processes.

- **Emphasis on Subjective Experience**:
  - Investigate the neural correlates of subjective experiences and emotions, integrating methodologies such as qualitative research and narrative inquiry alongside quantitative approaches.

- **Holistic Approaches to Mental Health**:
  - Incorporate traditional healing practices and mindfulness into neuroscience research and therapeutic practices, promoting a more holistic approach to mental health.

### 5. Generating Novel Hypotheses and Theories

From this transposition, several novel hypotheses emerge:

- **Hypothesis 1**: Intuitive Decision-Making and Neural Activity
  - **Theory**: Intuitive decision-making processes are linked to specific neural circuits, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 
  - **Experimental Design**: Use fMRI to investigate brain activity during intuitive vs. analytical decision-making tasks.

- **Hypothesis 2**: Impact of Artistic Expression on Neuroplasticity
  - **Theory**: Engagement in artistic practices enhances neuroplasticity and cognitive flexibility, leading to improved emotional regulation.
  - **Experimental Design**: Conduct longitudinal studies comparing neuroplastic changes in individuals engaged in artistic activities versus control groups.

- **Hypothesis 3**: Integration of Indigenous Knowledge Systems
  - **Theory**: Indigenous ecological knowledge enhances cognitive and emotional understanding of environmental issues, reflected in neural activity patterns.
  - **Experimental Design**: Collaborate with Indigenous communities to study the effects of traditional ecological practices on brain function and community well-being.

### 6. Developing a New Lexicon

To facilitate communication between the domains, a new lexicon is needed:

- **Neuro-intuition**: The integration of intuitive decision-making processes with neural mechanisms.
- **Holistic neuroplasticity**: The concept that neuroplastic changes occur not only through experience but also through holistic practices like mindfulness and traditional healing.
- **Narrative neuroscience**: The study of how narratives and storytelling influence neural processes and emotional responses.

### 7. Comprehensive Research Agenda

A long-term research agenda should focus on the following areas:

- **Interdisciplinary Studies**: Investigate the interplay between neuroscience and non-science ways of knowing, particularly in mental health and well-being.
- **Cultural Neuroscience**: Explore how diverse cultural beliefs and practices influence neural processes and cognitive functioning.
