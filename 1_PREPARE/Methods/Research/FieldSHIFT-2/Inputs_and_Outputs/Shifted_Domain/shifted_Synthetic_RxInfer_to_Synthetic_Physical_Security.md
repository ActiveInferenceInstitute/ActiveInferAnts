The message passing algorithms from RxInfer.jl could be adapted to create a dynamic threat detection system that processes inputs from various surveillance sources (CCTV, motion sensors, etc.) and outputs real-time alerts about potential breaches.

**Active Inference for Security Protocols**
Active inference, as implemented in RxInfer.jl, can be used to model decision-making processes in security personnel. This would allow for the design of systems that not only react to threats but also proactively adjust security measures based on perceived risks.

### 5. Novel Hypotheses and Theories

**Hypothesis 1: Probabilistic Risk Assessment Framework**
A framework that utilizes Bayesian inference to continuously update risk assessments based on incoming data from surveillance and access control systems. This could lead to more adaptive security measures that evolve with changing threat landscapes.
