## Push and Pull: A Priming Sequence

Definition: The document explores the decoupling of cognitive (covert, attentional) and bodily (overt) behaviors.
Example: It provides a sequence of hands-on computer exercises to understand how attention interacts with computer use movements.

Fact: Attentional Push movements are faster and have a lower cognitive burden compared to Pulling-type goal-oriented strategies.
Example: Push actions can be seen as goal-oriented Pulls on a faster timescale.
Example: Both Push and Pull strategies are different and have unique benefits.

Definition: Push Movements are faster, less cognitively burdensome actions.
Example: Pull Movements are goal-oriented, temporally thicker strategies.
Example: Semantic Chunking/Buffering are techniques to enhance cognitive efficiency.
Example: Embodied and Mental Coordination involves the integration of physical and cognitive actions.

## Push and Pull attention Exercise Sequence

Example: Baseline Movement: Move the computer mouse or attention between two points (A and B).
Example: Moving with Awareness: Intentionally move between points A and B, noticing the difference between Push and Pull.
Example: Moving with Bodily Awareness: Move the mouse while pursing lips to engage motor behavior and repress speech preparation.
Example: Awareness of Speech Preparation: Relax mouth and explore differences in Push and Pull movements.
Example: Repetitive Vocalization: Alternate cognitive strategies while repeating a simple verbal syllable.
Example: Generation of Memorized Text: Push and pull while repeating memorized texts.
Example: Language Generation: Continue movements while generating novel monologue text.
Example: Coordinating with Language: Integrate movements with the generation of novel speech and communicative acts.

Fact: The exercises aim to develop new kinds of action, perception, multi-tasking, collaboration, and note-taking.
Example: Participants are encouraged to report back with personal variants and skills developed through these exercises.
Definition: Known Territory is a "clean, well-lighted place" for reading words and facts.
Example: Gray Zone is the ever-receding situational periphery.
Example: Dark Imaginarium is the unknown territory beyond the Gray Zone.
Definition: Linguistic Development involves the evolution of speech production and language comprehension.
Example: Babies babble "Ba, ba, ba," each phoneme is like an upright domino.
Example: Development stabilizes semiotic coincidences (e.g., "Are you hungry?" → "Yes").
Example: Speech production and language comprehension evolve through these processes.
Definition: Verbal Expression involves structured speech acts.
Example: Sentences are structured speech acts.
Example: Formatting and grammatical cues convey additional information about the speaker's cognitive model.
Definition: Gap-filling involves measurement-brick-dominos laid like an asphalt road, converting Imaginarium into the Known.
Example: Facts are classical and consensual.
Definition: Gap-respecting involves Quantum Active Inference mode, building up rather than out.
Definition: Questions as Jenga Towers involve intelligence flicking the top of the Jenga stack.
Example: Questions can lead to vast epistemic leaps or fine dissection.
Definition: Trailhead to Departure is near the edge of known facts, a point of departure.
Example: Abductive travel includes Gap-filling and Gap-respecting modes.
Example: Wayfinders prepare to go out and measure when they return.
Definition: Cognitive Engagement involves asking and answering questions with meta-cognitive awareness.
Example: Alice asks Bob a Quantum Question about a Geometry book.
Example: Bob uses meta-cognitive awareness to provide a factual response or look up the title.
Definition: Epistemic Imperative involves two archetypal response modes: resolving the question or canal jumping.
Example: First mode: Scaffolding towards known knowns.
Example: Second mode: Canal jumping to higher epistemic optionality.
Definition: Development of Knowledge occurs through conversations with different patterns and media.
Definition: Language is gap-respecting in its essence.
Example: May your reading illuminate the lights and darks of language.
