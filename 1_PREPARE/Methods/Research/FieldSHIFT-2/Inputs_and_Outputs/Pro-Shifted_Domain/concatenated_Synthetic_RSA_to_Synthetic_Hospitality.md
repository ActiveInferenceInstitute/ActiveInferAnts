10. Anticipate and address potential resistance or limitations to this domain shift, providing robust arguments, evidence, and counterarguments for its validity and potential impact. Consider philosophical, practical, and ethical implications of the shift, and propose strategies for overcoming potential obstacles to its acceptance and implementation.

11. Propose specific, detailed interdisciplinary collaborations or research initiatives that would be crucial for developing and validating this transposed domain. Outline the roles of different disciplines, potential methodologies, and expected outcomes of these collaborations. Consider both traditional academic partnerships and innovative cross-sector collaborations.
