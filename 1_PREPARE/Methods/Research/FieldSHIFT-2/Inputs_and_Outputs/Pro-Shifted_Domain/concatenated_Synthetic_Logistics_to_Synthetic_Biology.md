Example: Macrophages engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens through phagocytosis, a form of endocytosis.

# Organelle
Definition: Organelles are specialized structures within eukaryotic cells that perform specific functions essential for cellular processes.
Example: Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes for breaking down cellular debris and foreign materials.
Definition: Membrane-bound organelles create distinct compartments within the cell, allowing for the spatial organization of cellular functions.
Example: The nuclear envelope separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm, controlling the flow of genetic information.
Fact: Mitochondria contain their own DNA and ribosomes, evidence of their endosymbiotic origin.
Example: Human mitochondrial DNA is circular and encodes 37 genes, similar to bacterial genomes.
Fact: The nuclear pore complex regulates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
Example: mRNA molecules are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes for protein synthesis.
Fact: Peroxisomes play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species.
Example: In liver cells, peroxisomes break down fatty acids and detoxify alcohol, protecting the cell from oxidative damage.
Explanation: The endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from ancient prokaryotic organisms engulfed by early eukaryotic cells.
Example: The presence of a double membrane in mitochondria and chloroplasts supports their endosymbiotic origin from ancient bacteria.
Explanation: Vesicle trafficking between organelles is mediated by coat proteins, such as clathrin and COPI/COPII, ensuring proper cargo sorting and delivery.
Example: COPII-coated vesicles transport newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for further processing.
Question: How do cells regulate organelle number, size, and distribution in response to changing metabolic demands?
Example: Muscle cells increase mitochondrial number and size during endurance training to meet increased energy demands.
Question: What are the mechanisms of organelle inheritance during cell division, and how do they impact cellular function?
Example: During mitosis, the Golgi apparatus fragments and is distributed equally between daughter cells, ensuring proper protein processing in new cells.
Example: In neurons, the rough ER produces membrane proteins that are transported to the cell surface via the Golgi apparatus.
Example: Melanosomes in melanocytes synthesize and store melanin pigments, which are then transferred to keratinocytes in the skin.
Example: The contractile vacuole in freshwater protists expels excess water, maintaining osmotic balance in hypotonic environments.
Example: In plant cells, plasmodesmata allow for direct communication and transport between adjacent cells, forming the symplast.
