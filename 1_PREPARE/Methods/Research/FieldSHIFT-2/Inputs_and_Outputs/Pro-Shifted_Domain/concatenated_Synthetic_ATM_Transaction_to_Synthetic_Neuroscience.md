# Synapse
Definition: A synapse is the specialized junction between two neurons where information is transmitted from one neuron to another.
Example: The neuromuscular junction is a specialized synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber, mediating muscle contraction.
Example: Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to transmit signals, while electrical synapses allow for direct ion flow between cells.

Example: Synapses in the hippocampus are involved in learning and memory.
Example: Synapses in the visual cortex process visual information.
Example: Synapses in the auditory cortex process sound information.

Definition: Synaptic transmission is the process by which a signal is passed from one neuron to another across a synapse.
Example: At excitatory glutamatergic synapses, the release of glutamate activates AMPA receptors, causing postsynaptic depolarization.
Example: GABAergic inhibitory synapses hyperpolarize or shunt the postsynaptic neuron through activation of GABA receptors.
Example: Neuromodulatory synapses, such as dopaminergic synapses, can alter the excitability and responsiveness of target neurons.

Fact: Postsynaptic density (PSD) is a protein-rich specialization that organizes receptors and signaling molecules at excitatory synapses.
Example: PSD-95 is a scaffolding protein that clusters glutamate receptors and associated signaling molecules at excitatory synapses.
Example: The PSD contains various kinases and phosphatases that regulate receptor function and synaptic plasticity.
Example: Adhesion molecules in the synaptic cleft, such as neurexins and neuroligins, help align pre- and postsynaptic specializations.
Example: The PSD undergoes dynamic changes in response to synaptic activity, contributing to synaptic plasticity.

Fact: Short-term synaptic plasticity allows for dynamic regulation of synaptic strength on timescales of milliseconds to minutes.
Example: Paired-pulse facilitation occurs when two stimuli in close succession lead to enhanced neurotransmitter release on the second pulse.

Explanation: Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory.
Example: NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the hippocampus involves the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.
Example: Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD in the cerebellum involves internalization of AMPA receptors.
Example: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) adjusts synaptic strength based on the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials.
Example: LTP and LTD can occur at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, contributing to the fine-tuning of neural circuits.

Explanation: Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that maintains neuronal excitability within a functional range.
Example: Chronic blockade of neural activity leads to a compensatory increase in synaptic strength through the upregulation of postsynaptic receptors.
Example: Prolonged increases in network activity can result in the downscaling of excitatory synapses to prevent hyperexcitability.
Example: Synaptic scaling can occur globally across all synapses on a neuron or locally in specific dendritic branches.
Example: Synaptic scaling helps stabilize neural circuits during development and learning.

Question: How do synapses maintain their molecular organization and function over long periods, given the rapid turnover of synaptic proteins?
Example: The PSD undergoes continuous remodeling through the exchange of scaffolding proteins and receptors with extrasynaptic pools.

Question: What are the mechanisms underlying silent synapses, and how do they contribute to synaptic plasticity and circuit development?
Example: Silent synapses contain only NMDA receptors and become functional through the activity-dependent insertion of AMPA receptors.
Example: During development, the conversion of silent synapses to functional synapses plays a role in the refinement of neural circuits.
Example: The unsilencing of synapses through the insertion of AMPA receptors is a key mechanism in certain forms of LTP.
