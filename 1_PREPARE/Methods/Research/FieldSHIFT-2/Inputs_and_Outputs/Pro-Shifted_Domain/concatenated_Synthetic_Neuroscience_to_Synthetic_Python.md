Example: The ease of use and learning curve of the framework, which can impact the speed of development and experimentation.
Example: The performance and scalability of the framework, especially for large datasets and complex models.
Example: The level of community support and availability of resources, such as tutorials and documentation, which can aid in troubleshooting and learning.
Example: The compatibility of the framework with other tools and libraries in the Python ecosystem, facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
Example: Quadray coordinates (tetrahedral coordinates) have been implemented in Python by Kirby Urner.
