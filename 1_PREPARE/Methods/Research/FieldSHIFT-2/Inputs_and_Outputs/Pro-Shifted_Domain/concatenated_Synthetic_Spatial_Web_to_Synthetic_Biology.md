Example: The presence of a double membrane in mitochondria and chloroplasts supports their endosymbiotic origin from ancient bacteria.
Explanation: Vesicle trafficking between organelles is mediated by coat proteins, such as clathrin and COPI/COPII, ensuring proper cargo sorting and delivery.
Example: COPII-coated vesicles transport newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for further processing.
Question: How do cells regulate organelle number, size, and distribution in response to changing metabolic demands?
Example: Muscle cells increase mitochondrial number and size during endurance training to meet increased energy demands.
Question: What are the mechanisms of organelle inheritance during cell division, and how do they impact cellular function?
Example: During mitosis, the Golgi apparatus fragments and is distributed equally between daughter cells, ensuring proper protein processing in new cells.
Example: In neurons, the rough ER produces membrane proteins that are transported to the cell surface via the Golgi apparatus.
Example: Melanosomes in melanocytes synthesize and store melanin pigments, which are then transferred to keratinocytes in the skin.
Example: The contractile vacuole in freshwater protists expels excess water, maintaining osmotic balance in hypotonic environments.
Example: In plant cells, plasmodesmata allow for direct communication and transport between adjacent cells, forming the symplast.
