Example: The synthesis of element 118 (oganesson) pushes the limits of our understanding of nuclear stability.
Example: Studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements may reveal deviations from periodic trends.
Example: The search for the "island of stability" in superheavy elements could lead to the discovery of new, relatively stable isotopes.

Example: The lanthanide elements exhibit similar chemical properties due to the shielding effect of f-orbitals.
Example: Carbon's ability to form diverse covalent compounds underlies the vast field of organic chemistry.
Example: The discovery of fullerenes expanded our understanding of carbon's allotropic forms beyond graphite and diamond.
Example: Helium's low boiling point and inertness make it valuable for cryogenic applications and as a lifting gas.
Example: The reactivity of fluorine as the most electronegative element leads to its use in the synthesis of strong oxidizing agents.
Example: The unique nuclear properties of californium enable its use as a portable neutron source in various applications.

# Chemical Bond
Definition: A chemical bond is an attractive force that holds atoms or ions together in a chemical compound, resulting from the sharing or transfer of electrons.
Example: The covalent bond in a hydrogen molecule (H2) involves the sharing of two electrons between hydrogen atoms.
Example: The ionic bond in sodium chloride (NaCl) results from the transfer of an electron from sodium to chlorine.
Example: The metallic bond in copper allows for the delocalization of electrons, contributing to its electrical conductivity.

Definition: Bond order refers to the number of electron pairs shared between two bonded atoms in a molecule.
Example: The triple bond in nitrogen (N≡N) has a bond order of 3, contributing to its high stability.
Example: The resonance structures of benzene result in a bond order of 1.5 for each carbon-carbon bond.
Example: The partial double bond character in peptide bonds influences the planarity of protein backbones.

Fact: Bond length is inversely related to bond strength, with shorter bonds generally being stronger.
Example: The carbon-carbon triple bond in acetylene (HC≡CH) is shorter and stronger than the double bond in ethylene (H2C=CH2).
Example: The O-H bond in water is shorter than the O-H bond in methanol due to increased s-character.
Example: The varying bond lengths in ozone (O3) reflect its resonance structures and partial double bond character.

Fact: Electronegativity differences between bonded atoms determine the polarity of chemical bonds.
Example: The H-F bond is highly polar due to the large electronegativity difference between hydrogen and fluorine.
Example: The C-C bonds in alkanes are nonpolar due to the equal sharing of electrons between carbon atoms.
Example: The polarity of the C-O bond in alcohols contributes to their solubility in water.

Fact: Hybridization of atomic orbitals explains the geometry and bonding patterns in molecules.
Example: The sp3 hybridization in methane (CH4) results in its tetrahedral structure with 109.5° bond angles.
Example: The sp2 hybridization in ethylene (C2H4) leads to its planar structure with a 120° H-C-H bond angle.
Example: The sp hybridization in acetylene (C2H2) produces its linear structure with 180° bond angles.
