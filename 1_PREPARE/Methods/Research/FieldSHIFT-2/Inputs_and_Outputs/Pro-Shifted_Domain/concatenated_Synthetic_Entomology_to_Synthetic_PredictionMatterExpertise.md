# Push and Pull: A Priming Sequence
Definition: The document explores the decoupling of cognitive (covert, attentional) and bodily (overt) behaviors.
Example: It provides a sequence of hands-on computer exercises to understand how attention interacts with computer use movements.

Fact: Attentional Push movements are faster and have a lower cognitive burden compared to Pulling-type goal-oriented strategies.
Example: Push actions can be seen as goal-oriented Pulls on a faster timescale.
Example: Both Push and Pull strategies are different and have unique benefits.

Definition: Push Movements are faster, less cognitively burdensome actions.
Example: Pull Movements are goal-oriented, temporally thicker strategies.
Example: Semantic Chunking/Buffering are techniques to enhance cognitive efficiency.
Example: Embodied and Mental Coordination involves the integration of physical and cognitive actions.

# Exercise Sequence
Example: Baseline Movement: Move the computer mouse or attention between two points (A and B).
Example: Moving with Awareness: Intentionally move between points A and B, noticing the difference between Push and Pull.
Example: Moving with Bodily Awareness: Move the mouse while pursing lips to engage motor behavior and repress speech preparation.
Example: Awareness of Speech Preparation: Relax mouth and explore differences in Push and Pull movements.
Example: Repetitive Vocalization: Alternate cognitive strategies while repeating a simple verbal syllable.
Example: Generation of Memorized Text: Push and pull while repeating memorized texts.
