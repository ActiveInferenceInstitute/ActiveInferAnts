Example: In motor control, the cerebellum generates predictions about the sensory consequences of movements, with discrepancies driving motor learning.

Definition: Prediction errors in predictive coding represent the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs, driving both perception and learning.
Example: The "oddball" effect in auditory perception, where an unexpected sound in a sequence generates a larger neural response, reflects a prediction error.
Example: The gradual improvement in a skill, like playing a musical instrument, involves the reduction of prediction errors over time through practice.
Example: In social interactions, prediction errors about others' behavior drive updates to our models of their intentions and mental states.
