Example: The Drosophila neuromuscular junction serves as a model system for studying synaptic development and plasticity.
Example: Mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus exhibit unique forms of presynaptic plasticity.
Example: Dendritic spines, the primary sites of excitatory synapses, can rapidly change shape and size in response to synaptic activity.
Example: Synapses in the autonomic nervous system regulate involuntary functions such as heart rate and digestion.

# Brain Region
Definition: A brain region is an anatomically or functionally distinct area of the brain with specialized roles in information processing and behavior.
Example: The hippocampus is crucial for spatial navigation and the formation of episodic memories.
Example: The amygdala plays a central role in emotional processing, particularly in fear and anxiety responses.
Example: The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions, including decision-making, planning, and working memory.
Example: The occipital lobe processes visual information, including color, shape, and motion.

Definition: Cortical layers are distinct horizontal organizations of neurons within the cerebral cortex, each with specific connectivity and functions.
Example: Layer 4 of the primary visual cortex receives thalamic input and is the primary site of sensory information processing.
Example: Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex project to the spinal cord, controlling voluntary movement.
Example: Layer 2/3 neurons in the cortex form extensive horizontal connections, integrating information across cortical columns.
Example: Layer 6 neurons provide feedback to the thalamus, modulating sensory input.

Fact: The cerebellum contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined and is crucial for motor coordination and learning.
Example: Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex integrate inputs from climbing fibers and parallel fibers to modulate motor output.
Example: The cerebellar nuclei receive inhibitory input from Purkinje cells and provide the primary output of the cerebellum.
Example: The cerebellum is involved in timing and prediction of sensory and motor events, beyond its classical role in motor control.
Example: The cerebellum also plays a role in cognitive functions such as language and attention.

Fact: The basal ganglia form a network of subcortical nuclei involved in action selection, motor control, and reward-based learning.
Example: The striatum receives input from the cortex and acts as the primary input structure of the basal ganglia.
Example: The substantia nigra pars compacta provides dopaminergic input to the striatum, crucial for reinforcement learning.
