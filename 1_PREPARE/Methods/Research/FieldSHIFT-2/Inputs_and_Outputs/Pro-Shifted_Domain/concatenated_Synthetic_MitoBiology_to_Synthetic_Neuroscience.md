Fact: Postsynaptic density (PSD) is a protein-rich specialization that organizes receptors and signaling molecules at excitatory synapses.
Example: PSD-95 is a scaffolding protein that clusters glutamate receptors and associated signaling molecules at excitatory synapses.
Example: The PSD contains various kinases and phosphatases that regulate receptor function and synaptic plasticity.
Example: Adhesion molecules in the synaptic cleft, such as neurexins and neuroligins, help align pre- and postsynaptic specializations.
Example: The PSD undergoes dynamic changes in response to synaptic activity, contributing to synaptic plasticity.

Fact: Short-term synaptic plasticity allows for dynamic regulation of synaptic strength on timescales of milliseconds to minutes.
Example: Paired-pulse facilitation occurs when two stimuli in close succession lead to enhanced neurotransmitter release on the second pulse.
Example: Synaptic depression can result from depletion of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles during high-frequency stimulation.
Example: Posttetanic potentiation is a form of short-term plasticity lasting minutes after a tetanic stimulation.
Example: Short-term synaptic plasticity can influence information processing and network dynamics.

Explanation: Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory.
Example: NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the hippocampus involves the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.
Example: Metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD in the cerebellum involves internalization of AMPA receptors.
Example: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) adjusts synaptic strength based on the precise timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials.
Example: LTP and LTD can occur at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, contributing to the fine-tuning of neural circuits.

Explanation: Synaptic scaling is a form of homeostatic plasticity that maintains neuronal excitability within a functional range.
Example: Chronic blockade of neural activity leads to a compensatory increase in synaptic strength through the upregulation of postsynaptic receptors.
Example: Prolonged increases in network activity can result in the downscaling of excitatory synapses to prevent hyperexcitability.
Example: Synaptic scaling can occur globally across all synapses on a neuron or locally in specific dendritic branches.
Example: Synaptic scaling helps stabilize neural circuits during development and learning.

Question: How do synapses maintain their molecular organization and function over long periods, given the rapid turnover of synaptic proteins?
Example: The PSD undergoes continuous remodeling through the exchange of scaffolding proteins and receptors with extrasynaptic pools.
Example: Local protein synthesis in dendrites allows for rapid, input-specific changes in synaptic composition.
Example: Retrograde signaling from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic terminal helps coordinate pre- and postsynaptic function.
Example: Synaptic adhesion molecules play a role in maintaining synaptic structure and function.

Question: What are the mechanisms underlying silent synapses, and how do they contribute to synaptic plasticity and circuit development?
Example: Silent synapses contain only NMDA receptors and become functional through the activity-dependent insertion of AMPA receptors.
Example: During development, the conversion of silent synapses to functional synapses plays a role in the refinement of neural circuits.
Example: The unsilencing of synapses through the insertion of AMPA receptors is a key mechanism in certain forms of LTP.
Example: Silent synapses may serve as a reserve pool for synaptic plasticity and learning.

Example: The calyx of Held is a large synapse in the auditory brainstem that allows for precise timing of signal transmission.
Example: Ribbon synapses in sensory neurons of the retina and inner ear are specialized for sustained neurotransmitter release.
Example: Tripartite synapses involve astrocytic processes that modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity.
Example: The Drosophila neuromuscular junction serves as a model system for studying synaptic development and plasticity.
Example: Mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus exhibit unique forms of presynaptic plasticity.
Example: Dendritic spines, the primary sites of excitatory synapses, can rapidly change shape and size in response to synaptic activity.
Example: Synapses in the autonomic nervous system regulate involuntary functions such as heart rate and digestion.

# Brain Region
Definition: A brain region is an anatomically or functionally distinct area of the brain with specialized roles in information processing and behavior.
Example: The hippocampus is crucial for spatial navigation and the formation of episodic memories.
Example: The amygdala plays a central role in emotional processing, particularly in fear and anxiety responses.
Example: The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functions, including decision-making, planning, and working memory.
Example: The occipital lobe processes visual information, including color, shape, and motion.

Definition: Cortical layers are distinct horizontal organizations of neurons within the cerebral cortex, each with specific connectivity and functions.
Example: Layer 4 of the primary visual cortex receives thalamic input and is the primary site of sensory information processing.
Example: Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the motor cortex project to the spinal cord, controlling voluntary movement.
Example: Layer 2/3 neurons in the cortex form extensive horizontal connections, integrating information across cortical columns.
Example: Layer 6 neurons provide feedback to the thalamus, modulating sensory input.

Fact: The cerebellum contains more neurons than the rest of the brain combined and is crucial for motor coordination and learning.
Example: Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex integrate inputs from climbing fibers and parallel fibers to modulate motor output.
Example: The cerebellar nuclei receive inhibitory input from Purkinje cells and provide the primary output of the cerebellum.
Example: The cerebellum is involved in timing and prediction of sensory and motor events, beyond its classical role in motor control.
Example: The cerebellum also plays a role in cognitive functions such as language and attention.

Fact: The basal ganglia form a network of subcortical nuclei involved in action selection, motor control, and reward-based learning.
Example: The striatum receives input from the cortex and acts as the primary input structure of the basal ganglia.
Example: The substantia nigra pars compacta provides dopaminergic input to the striatum, crucial for reinforcement learning.
