# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks" investigates the potential benefits of incorporating biological neural mechanisms—such as synaptic plasticity, neuron diversity, and glial support—into artificial neural networks (ANNs). The research questions focus on how these biological principles can enhance the performance, interpretability, and adaptability of ANNs. Overall, the work presents a compelling alignment with the National Science Foundation's (NSF) mission to advance scientific research and education, particularly within the Biological Sciences (BIO) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) directorates. The NSF aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, which this dissertation exemplifies by bridging neuroscience and artificial intelligence. 

The dissertation's emphasis on improving ANNs through biological insights aligns well with the NSF's objectives, particularly in enhancing understanding of biological systems and advancing computing technologies.
