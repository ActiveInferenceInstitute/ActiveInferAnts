# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## 1. Introduction

- **Summary of the Dissertation's Main Topic and Research Questions**:
  This dissertation presents an innovative exploration of the intersection between neural networks and the life and works of William Blake. It proposes a theoretical framework that interprets Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements, leveraging concepts from neuroscience such as synaptic plasticity and cognitive resonance. The overarching research questions focus on modeling Blake's themes as neural networks, understanding the dynamics of neural communication to enhance comprehension of Blake's expression, and exploring the interdisciplinary implications of this approach across neuroscience, literary studies, and education.

- **Overall Impression**:
  The dissertation is a compelling and novel contribution to both literary analysis and cognitive science. However, its relevance to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) grant objectives, which primarily focus on measurement science, standards development, technology advancement, and cybersecurity, appears limited. While the interdisciplinary nature of the research is commendable, it does not directly align with NIST's core mission.

- **Mission of NIST**:
  NIST's mission is to advance measurement science and technology to enhance industrial competitiveness and improve quality of life. The dissertation, while innovative, does not directly address measurement science or technological advancement in a manner that aligns with NIST's objectives. Therefore, it is concluded that the dissertation does not significantly align with the grant's focus areas.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**:
  The dissertation's exploration of neural networks and literary analysis does not align with NIST's focus areas such as measurement science, standards development, or technology advancement. The work primarily contributes to literary studies and cognitive science rather than addressing the practical applications of measurement and technology that NIST promotes.

- **Specific Examples from the Dissertation**:
  - The dissertation discusses "thematic neurons" and "synaptic connections," which are innovative concepts within literary analysis but do not contribute to NIST's objectives of developing precise measurement techniques or technological innovations.
  - The research emphasizes cognitive processes in artistic engagement rather than advancing measurement science or technology, which is central to NIST's mission.

- **Quantitative Measures**:
  Given the focus of the dissertation, it would likely fall outside the top 25% in relevance to NIST's funding criteria. The work does not contribute to the development of standards or measurement techniques, which are critical for grant consideration.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

1. **Strongly Positive**:
   - The interdisciplinary approach is innovative and could inspire future research collaborations.
   - "This research bridges the gap between neuroscience and literature," showcasing a unique perspective.

2. **Positive**:
   - The theoretical framework is well-developed and could provide valuable insights into cognitive engagement.
   - "Thematic neurons allow for a dynamic understanding of Blake's themes," which is a commendable approach.

3. **Neutral**:
   - While the dissertation presents interesting concepts, its application to real-world technology and measurement is limited.
   - The relevance to NIST's objectives is not clearly established.

4. **Negative**:
   - The focus on literary analysis may detract from the practical applications necessary for grant funding.
   - "The research primarily enriches literary criticism," which does not align with NIST's mission.

5. **Strongly Negative**:
   - The lack of direct relevance to measurement science and technology is a significant drawback.
   - "The work does not contribute to the advancement of measurement techniques," which is essential for NIST's goals.

6. **Critical**:
   - The dissertation could benefit from a clearer connection to technological applications or measurement standards.
   - "The interdisciplinary nature is intriguing, but without practical applications, it lacks alignment with NIST's objectives."

## 4. Contribution to the Field

- **Overall Contribution**:
  The dissertation significantly contributes to the fields of literary studies and cognitive science but does not address the objectives of measurement science or technology advancement as outlined in the NIST grant. The innovative integration of neural network principles offers fresh interpretations of Blake's work.

- **Comparison with Grant Focus Areas**:
  - The dissertation emphasizes cognitive engagement and thematic exploration, while NIST focuses on the development of standards and measurement techniques.
  - For example, the dissertation states, "This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism," which is commendable but does not address the technological advancements NIST seeks to promote.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

- **Evaluation of Methodology**:
  The mixed-methods approach combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling is appropriate for the research questions. However, it does not align with NIST's requirements for rigorous measurement methodologies.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**:
  The use of neural network modeling to explore thematic connections is innovative, but the applicability to NIST's objectives is minimal. The dissertation states, "This combination of methodologies will provide a robust framework," which is true for literary analysis but not for measurement science.

## 6. Writing and Structure

- **Quality of Writing**:
  The dissertation is well-written, clear, and organized, with a logical flow of ideas. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables enhance the understanding of complex concepts.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

- **Specific Recommendations**:
  - To enhance alignment with NIST's objectives, the dissertation could incorporate practical applications of neural network principles in measurement science or technology development.
  - Exploring how cognitive processes could inform the development of standards or measurement techniques would strengthen the relevance.

## 8. Conclusion

- **Summary of Evaluation**:
  The dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that significantly contributes to literary studies and cognitive science. However, its relevance to the NIST grant is limited due to the lack of focus on measurement science and technology advancement.

- **Final Assessment**:
  While the dissertation is a commendable scholarly effort, it does not align with the core objectives of the NIST grant. Enhancing the connection to practical applications in measurement and technology would improve its relevance to NIST's mission. 15.659993410110474
