# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## 1. Introduction

- **Summary of the Dissertation**: The dissertation explores the intersection of neural networks and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a theoretical framework that interprets Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements. The research questions focus on modeling Blake's themes as neural networks, understanding the dynamics of neural communication in relation to his artistic expression, and exploring the implications for cognitive science, literary studies, and education.

- **Overall Impression**: The dissertation presents a unique interdisciplinary approach that combines neuroscience with literary analysis, offering fresh insights into Blake's work. However, its relevance to the objectives of the NIST Suborder 6106.01 grant is limited, as the grant primarily focuses on software development and reuse rather than literary or cognitive studies.

- **Organizational Mission and Alignment**: The mission of our organization is to enhance the efficiency and transparency of software development through the promotion of open-source code. While the dissertation demonstrates innovative thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration, it does not align with the grant's objectives related to software development, open-source release, or the reuse of custom-developed code.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**: The dissertation's focus on neural networks and literary analysis does not directly address the objectives of the NIST Suborder 6106.01, which emphasizes the reuse of software code, documentation, and compliance with open-source policies. The grant's focus areas include:
  - **Open Source Software (OSS) Release**: The dissertation does not propose any software or tools that could be released as OSS, nor does it engage with software development practices.
  - **Documentation Requirements**: While the dissertation includes a theoretical framework, it lacks practical documentation that aligns with the grant's requirement for comprehensive documentation of custom-developed code.
  - **Alternatives Analysis**: The dissertation does not conduct an analysis of software alternatives, which is a key requirement of the grant.

- **Specific Examples**: The dissertation states, "By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, this dissertation not only offers fresh interpretations of his themes but also contributes to the broader discourse on the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation and appreciation." This statement reflects the research's focus on cognitive processes rather than software development or open-source practices.

- **Quantitative Measures**: The dissertation does not provide quantitative measures or data that align with the grant's objectives. The focus on literary and cognitive analysis does not lend itself to the quantitative evaluation of software development projects.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

- **Strongly Positive Perspective**: The interdisciplinary nature of the dissertation is commendable. The integration of neuroscience and literature could inspire innovative approaches in educational settings. For example, the concept of "thematic neurons" is a creative way to visualize literary themes.

- **Positive Perspective**: The research contributes to the discourse on cognitive processes in artistic creation, which could have implications for understanding creativity in various fields. However, this contribution is more relevant to academic literature than to the grant's objectives.

- **Neutral Perspective**: The dissertation's theoretical framework is well-constructed and offers a unique perspective on Blake's work. However, it does not address the practical applications or implications for software development, which is a key focus of the grant.

- **Negative Perspective**: The lack of practical software development or open-source components significantly limits the dissertation's relevance to the grant. The absence of a clear connection to the reuse of software code is a major drawback.

- **Strongly Negative Perspective**: The dissertation's focus on literary analysis and cognitive science is entirely misaligned with the grant's objectives. The research does not engage with the requirements for OSS release, documentation, or compliance with software development standards.

- **Final Perspective**: Overall, while the dissertation is innovative and well-researched, it fails to meet the criteria set forth by the grant. The lack of relevant applications to software development and open-source practices makes it unsuitable for funding consideration.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

- **Overall Contribution**: The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the fields of literary studies and cognitive science by proposing an innovative framework for understanding Blake's work. It challenges traditional literary analysis by incorporating neural network principles, thereby enriching the discourse on creativity and artistic expression.

- **Comparison with Grant Focus Areas**: The grant emphasizes the importance of open-source software and the reuse of code, while the dissertation focuses on cognitive processes and literary themes. For example, the dissertation states, "The convergence of neural networks and literary analysis represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding creativity and artistic expression." This statement highlights the dissertation's focus on creative processes rather than software development.

- **Juxtaposition of Quotes**: The grant's objective of "promoting the reuse of software code" contrasts sharply with the dissertation's assertion that "this research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism." The two domains are fundamentally different, and the dissertation does not align with the grant's goals.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

- **Evaluation of Methodology**: The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. While this methodology is appropriate for the research questions, it does not align with the grant's requirements for software development.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The analysis includes thematic exploration and neural network modeling. However, there is no discussion of data analysis techniques relevant to software development or open-source practices. The dissertation states, "This dual approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes and their cognitive implications," but it lacks practical applications for software development.

- **Limitations**: The primary limitation of the methodology is its focus on literary analysis rather than software development. The dissertation does not address the requirements for documentation or alternatives analysis, which are critical components of the grant.

## 6. Writing and Structure

- **Quality of Writing**: The dissertation is well-written, with clear and organized sections that effectively convey the research's findings. However, the writing does not engage with the practical implications of software development, which is a key focus of the grant.

- **Use of Citations and Figures**: The dissertation includes appropriate citations and figures to support its arguments. However, these elements do not relate to the grant's standards for software documentation or open-source practices.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - **Incorporate Software Development Elements**: To align more closely with the grant's objectives, the dissertation could explore the development of a software tool that models Blake's themes as a neural network. This would provide a concrete application of the research.
  - **Focus on Open Source Release**: The dissertation should consider how the findings could be translated into open-source software, including documentation and compliance with OSS standards.
  - **Conduct Alternatives Analysis**: An analysis of existing software tools that could model literary themes would enhance the relevance of the research to the grant's requirements.

- **Potential Impact of Improvements**: By incorporating these recommendations, the dissertation could significantly enhance its relevance to the grant, demonstrating practical applications of the research in the field of software development and open-source practices.

## 8. Conclusion

- **Summary of Evaluation**: The dissertation presents a unique interdisciplinary approach that contributes to literary studies and cognitive science. However, its relevance to the NIST Suborder 6106.01 grant is limited due to a lack of focus on software development, open-source practices, and compliance with grant requirements.

- **Final Assessment**: While the dissertation is innovative and well-researched, it does not align with the grant's objectives. To enhance its relevance and potential impact, the dissertation should incorporate elements related to software development and open-source release. 22.123957872390747
