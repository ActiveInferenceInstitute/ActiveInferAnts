# Evaluation of Dissertation Relevance to NIST Suborder 6106.01: Open Source Code Directive

## 1. Introduction

This dissertation, titled **"Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Mitochondrial Function,"** explores the intersection of neural network principles and mitochondrial biology, proposing a novel theoretical framework termed the **Shifted Domain**. The research questions focus on how mitochondrial networks adapt to energy demands, the mechanisms of mitochondrial plasticity, and the influence of mitochondrial dynamics on cellular signaling. Overall, the work is innovative and interdisciplinary, aiming to bridge two distinct fields to uncover new insights into cellular metabolism.

In the context of the NIST Suborder 6106.01 grant objectives, which advocate for the reuse of software code and the promotion of open-source software (OSS) in federal projects, the dissertation appears to be tangentially relevant. While the dissertation does not directly address software development or open-source practices, the interdisciplinary nature of the research could lead to new software tools and models for simulating mitochondrial functions, potentially benefiting the scientific community. However, it is essential to note that the primary focus of the dissertation does not align closely with the grant's objectives around software code reuse and open-source development.

The mission of NIST is to enhance innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology. Although this dissertation does not directly contribute to these objectives, the potential implications of its findings may foster interdisciplinary collaborations that could lead to innovations in software tools for biological research.
