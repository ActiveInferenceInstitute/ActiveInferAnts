# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Blockchain Technology"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Blockchain Technology" explores the innovative intersection between chemical principles and blockchain systems. The primary research questions focus on how concepts from chemistry, such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics, can be applied to enhance blockchain transaction validation, scalability, and efficiency. The work proposes novel consensus mechanisms and dynamic load balancing strategies, aiming to create a framework that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration.

Overall, the dissertation presents a compelling case for the potential benefits of applying chemical principles to blockchain technology. However, the relevance to the NIST Suborder 6106.01: Open Source Code Directive is limited. While the dissertation addresses innovative technological solutions, it does not directly engage with the directive's focus on custom-developed software and open-source code requirements. The mission of our organization is to promote the reuse of software code within NIST, and while this dissertation introduces valuable interdisciplinary insights, it does not align closely with the specific objectives of the grant.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The NIST Suborder 6106.01 directive emphasizes the need for the reuse of software code and the promotion of open-source software (OSS) within NIST projects. The dissertation, while innovative, primarily focuses on the theoretical application of chemical principles to blockchain technology, which does not directly address the grant's core objectives. 

### Key Areas of Misalignment:
- **Focus on Open Source**: The directive requires that at least 20% of newly commissioned code be released as OSS. The dissertation does not discuss the development of software or code that could be made open source, nor does it provide mechanisms for OSS release.
- **Custom-Developed Code**: The grant focuses on custom-developed software for production use. The dissertation does not present a framework for developing software that meets this criterion, as it is largely theoretical and lacks a concrete software implementation or case study.

### Quantitative Measures:
- **Funding/Relevance Percentiles**: Based on the objectives of the grant, the dissertation can be rated at a low relevance percentile (10-15%), as it does not fulfill the specific requirements set forth in the directive.

### Supporting Examples:
- The dissertation states, "The transformative potential of this Shifted Domain... ultimately contributing to a more efficient and sustainable blockchain ecosystem." While this is a valuable contribution, it does not relate to the NIST directive's focus on software reuse and OSS.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive
- **Interdisciplinary Innovation**: The dissertation introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach by applying chemical principles to blockchain technology. This could inspire future research collaborations.
  
### Positive
- **Theoretical Framework**: The theoretical constructs presented, such as "Catalytic Consensus Mechanisms," are innovative and could spark interest in new methodologies within blockchain research.

### Neutral
- **Experimental Design**: While the mixed-methods approach is commendable, the lack of concrete software development limits its applicability to the grant's objectives.

### Negative
- **Lack of Practical Application**: The research does not provide practical applications or case studies that demonstrate how the proposed models could be implemented in real-world blockchain systems.

### Strongly Negative
- **Limited Relevance to Grant**: The dissertation does not engage with the requirements of the NIST directive, making it less relevant for funding consideration. 

### Overall Rationale:
The dissertation demonstrates creativity and interdisciplinary potential but lacks direct alignment with the specific objectives of the NIST Suborder 6106.01 directive. The focus on theoretical constructs without practical software development limits its applicability to the grant's goals.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a noteworthy contribution to both chemistry and blockchain technology by proposing an innovative framework that applies chemical principles in a novel context. However, its contribution must be viewed through the lens of the grant's objectives.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives:
- **Grant Objective**: Promote the reuse of software code and OSS.
- **Dissertation Contribution**: Introduces catalytic consensus mechanisms, which could enhance blockchain efficiency but does not address software reuse or OSS.

### Juxtaposed Quotes:
- Dissertation: "The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology..."
- Grant Summary: "The directive aims to establish requirements that promote the reuse of software code..."

While the dissertation presents innovative ideas, it fails to align with the grant's focus on practical software development and open-source initiatives.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research. This methodology is appropriate for exploring theoretical constructs but lacks the rigor expected for software development projects outlined in the grant.

### Data Analysis Techniques:
- **Statistical Analysis**: While the dissertation mentions statistical methods for evaluating models, it does not provide sufficient detail on how these analyses will be applied to real-world software development.
  
### Limitations:
- The absence of concrete software applications limits the effectiveness of the methodology. The dissertation states, "Experimental studies will be conducted," but does not detail how these experiments will translate into software development.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written and logically structured, with clear sections outlining the theoretical framework, methodology, and implications. However, it lacks citations and examples that would strengthen its connection to the grant objectives.

### Quality of Writing:
- The writing is clear and engaging, making complex ideas accessible. However, the absence of practical examples or citations relevant to OSS detracts from its overall impact.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's alignment with the grant's objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:
- **Incorporate Software Development**: The dissertation should include a section on how the proposed theories can be implemented in software development, particularly in creating OSS.
- **Case Studies**: Adding real-world case studies demonstrating the application of the proposed models in blockchain systems would strengthen the practical relevance.
- **Engagement with OSS**: Explicitly address how at least 20% of the proposed software could be released as open-source, including documentation and compliance with the grant's requirements.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Blockchain Technology" presents innovative theoretical constructs that explore the intersection of chemistry and blockchain. However, its relevance to the NIST Suborder 6106.01 directive is limited due to a lack of focus on software development and open-source initiatives. While the work is commendable for its interdisciplinary approach, significant improvements are needed to align it with the grant's objectives. Overall, the dissertation has the potential to contribute to the field, but its current form does not meet the specific requirements for funding consideration. 16.666666507720947
