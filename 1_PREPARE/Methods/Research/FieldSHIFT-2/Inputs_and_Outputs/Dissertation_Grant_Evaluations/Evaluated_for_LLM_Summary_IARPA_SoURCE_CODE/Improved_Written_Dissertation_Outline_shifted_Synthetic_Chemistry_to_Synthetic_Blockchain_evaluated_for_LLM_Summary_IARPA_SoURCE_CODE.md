# Evaluation of Dissertation Relevance to IARPA Broad Agency Announcement: IARPA-BAA-24-02

## 1. Introduction
The PhD dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Blockchain Technology" explores the innovative intersection of chemical principles and blockchain technology, proposing novel consensus mechanisms and models to improve transaction throughput and scalability. The research questions focus on how catalytic consensus mechanisms from chemistry can enhance blockchain transaction validation, how equilibrium models can inform adaptive protocols, and how kinetic models can optimize transaction throughput. 

Overall, the dissertation presents a unique interdisciplinary approach, yet it diverges significantly from the core objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE program, which is centered on enhancing cybersecurity through the attribution of cyberattacks based on coding styles. While the dissertation's exploration of blockchain technology is innovative, it does not directly address the grant's focus areas of forensic analysis, feature extraction, or similarity analysis in coding. The mission of IARPA is to advance national security through innovative technologies, particularly in cybersecurity, which is not aligned with the chemical and blockchain synthesis presented in the dissertation. 

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The IARPA SoURCE CODE program emphasizes developing technologies for forensic experts to attribute cyberattacks based on coding styles, focusing on feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability. The dissertation's focus on chemical reactions and blockchain technology does not intersect with these key areas. 

- **Feature Space Generation and Extraction**: The dissertation does not address the extraction of coding features or the development of encoding schemes for source code and binaries. Instead, it proposes frameworks based on chemical principles that do not apply to coding styles.
  
- **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms**: The research lacks any discussion of algorithms for identifying similar binaries or inferring demographic information about authors. The focus is primarily on optimizing blockchain transactions rather than analyzing coding patterns.

- **System Explainability**: The dissertation does not provide mechanisms for interpretable feedback to forensic experts, which is a critical requirement of the grant. 

Quantitatively, if we were to evaluate the relevance of the dissertation to the grant's objectives, it would likely fall below a 10% relevance threshold, as it does not engage with the core themes outlined in the IARPA BAA.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
### Strongly Positive Perspective
- The interdisciplinary approach is innovative and could lead to novel applications in other areas of technology. The synthesis of chemistry and blockchain could inspire future research directions.
  
### Positive Perspective
- The dissertation demonstrates a high level of theoretical understanding of both chemistry and blockchain. The proposed consensus mechanisms could have implications beyond the current research.

### Neutral Perspective
- While the dissertation is well-structured and presents interesting ideas, its relevance to the IARPA grant is minimal. The connection to cybersecurity is tenuous at best.

### Negative Perspective
- The lack of focus on cybersecurity and coding styles is a significant shortcoming. The research does not address any of the specific objectives outlined in the IARPA BAA.

### Strongly Negative Perspective
- The dissertation appears to be a misalignment with the grant's mission. The exploration of chemical reactions in the context of blockchain technology does not contribute to enhancing national security through cybersecurity measures.

### Overall Rationale
The dissertation excels in theoretical innovation but lacks practical relevance to the objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE program, which is focused on cybersecurity and forensic analysis.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation contributes to the fields of chemistry and blockchain technology by proposing a framework that applies chemical principles to optimize blockchain systems. However, when viewed through the lens of the IARPA grant's objectives, the contributions are limited.

- **Comparison with Grant Objectives**: The grant emphasizes the need for technologies that enhance forensic analysis and attribution of cyberattacks. In contrast, the dissertation focuses on transaction validation in blockchain, which does not address the need for improved cybersecurity measures.

- **Quotes from Dissertation**: The assertion that "the transformative potential of this Shifted Domain...paves the way for interdisciplinary collaboration" underscores the innovative nature of the work, but it does not align with the grant's focus on national security.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis
The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, including simulations and expert interviews, which is appropriate for exploring the theoretical constructs proposed. However, the methodology does not align with the grant's requirements for empirical validation in cybersecurity contexts.

- **Effectiveness**: The experimental studies and simulations are well-designed; however, they focus on blockchain transaction scenarios rather than cybersecurity applications.

- **Limitations**: The lack of empirical data related to coding styles or cyberattack attribution limits the applicability of the findings to the IARPA grant context.

## 6. Writing and Structure
The dissertation is well-written, clearly organized, and employs appropriate academic standards. The use of figures and tables enhances comprehension, although they do not relate to the grant's objectives.

- **Citations**: The dissertation includes a comprehensive literature review, but the references do not address the intersection of blockchain and cybersecurity, which is critical for the IARPA grant.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
To better align the dissertation with the IARPA grant objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:

- **Focus on Cybersecurity Applications**: Integrate research that directly addresses the attribution of cyberattacks and coding style analysis.
  
- **Develop Relevant Algorithms**: Propose algorithms that can analyze coding styles similar to how chemical principles were applied to blockchain.

- **Enhance Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Engage with cybersecurity experts to ensure that the proposed models have practical implications for forensic analysis.

These improvements would significantly enhance the dissertation's relevance and potential impact within the context of the IARPA grant.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, while the dissertation presents innovative ideas at the intersection of chemistry and blockchain technology, it does not align with the objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE program. The work contributes to theoretical knowledge but lacks practical relevance to cybersecurity and forensic analysis. To maximize its impact, the dissertation would benefit from a stronger focus on the specific challenges and goals outlined in the IARPA grant. Overall, the dissertation's relevance to the grant is minimal, and substantial revisions would be required to enhance its alignment with IARPA's mission. 24.278459787368774
