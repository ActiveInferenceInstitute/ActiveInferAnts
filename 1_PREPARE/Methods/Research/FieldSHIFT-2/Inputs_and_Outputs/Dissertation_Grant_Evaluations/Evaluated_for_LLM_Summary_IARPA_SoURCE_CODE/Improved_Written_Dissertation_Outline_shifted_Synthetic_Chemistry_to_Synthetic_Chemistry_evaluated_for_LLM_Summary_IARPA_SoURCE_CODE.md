# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation Relevance to IARPA Broad Agency Announcement: IARPA-BAA-24-02

## 1. Introduction
- **Dissertation Summary**: The dissertation titled "Transposing Concepts from Chemical Reactions to Sustainable Chemical Processes" explores the innovative integration of traditional chemical reaction principles with sustainable practices, coining the term **Shifted Domain**. The research investigates how established chemical concepts can enhance sustainability in chemical processes, aiming to reduce waste and promote renewable resources.
  
- **Overall Impression**: While the dissertation is well-articulated and addresses significant environmental concerns, its focus on chemical processes diverges from the core objectives of the IARPA grant, which centers on cybersecurity and the attribution of cyberattacks based on coding styles. Thus, the dissertation's relevance to the grant is limited.

- **Organizational Mission Alignment**: IARPA's mission is to enhance national security through innovative technologies in cybersecurity, particularly in cyberattack attribution. The dissertation's focus on sustainable chemistry does not align with these objectives, indicating a minimal connection to the grant's goals.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
- **Assessment of Relevance**: The dissertation does not directly address the grant's focus areas, which include feature extraction from coding styles, similarity analysis in binary and source code, and system explainability for forensic experts. The grant seeks to develop technologies for cyberattack attribution, while the dissertation focuses on sustainable chemical processes, which are not applicable to cybersecurity.

- **Specific Examples**: The dissertation discusses concepts like **“Sustainable Catalysis”** and the design of **“Closed-loop Chemical Processes.”** However, these topics do not provide insights into coding styles or cyber attribution, which are critical to the IARPA grant. For instance, while the dissertation emphasizes reducing environmental impact through innovative chemistry, it fails to address any technological advancements relevant to cybersecurity.

- **Quantitative Measures**: Given the focus of the dissertation, its relevance percentile to the IARPA grant could be assessed as low (approximately 10-15%), emphasizing a significant misalignment with the grant's objectives.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
1. **Strongly Positive**: The dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach to sustainable chemistry, which could inspire innovative thinking in other fields, including cybersecurity, through the concept of system efficiency.
   
2. **Positive**: The research methodology is sound, employing mixed-methods that could be adapted for data analysis in cybersecurity contexts, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary approaches.

3. **Neutral**: While the dissertation is well-written and structured, the connection to the grant's objectives is tenuous. The theoretical constructs proposed, such as **“Sustainable Catalysis,”** do not resonate with the technical challenges outlined in the grant.

4. **Negative**: The dissertation lacks direct applicability to the IARPA objectives. For example, the extensive focus on **biocatalysis** and **thermodynamic modeling** does not contribute to the field of cybersecurity, which is the primary concern of the grant.

5. **Strongly Negative**: There is a complete absence of any discussion related to coding styles or forensic analysis, which are essential components of the IARPA grant. The research fails to address any of the program's technical challenges.

6. **Critical**: The dissertation could mislead stakeholders regarding its relevance to cybersecurity initiatives. The focus on chemical processes does not align with the pressing need for innovative technologies in cyber forensics.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
- **Overall Contribution**: The dissertation contributes significantly to the field of sustainable chemistry, offering innovative methodologies and insights. However, it does not provide relevant contributions to the field of cybersecurity, which is the focus of the IARPA grant.

- **Comparison with Grant Focus Areas**: The grant emphasizes developing technologies for cyberattack attribution, while the dissertation focuses on sustainable practices in chemistry. For example, the dissertation's discussion on **“Energy Minimization Strategies”** contrasts sharply with the grant's focus on **“Feature Space Generation and Extraction.”**

- **Quotes Comparison**: The dissertation states, "The potential for innovation in traditional chemical industries will be emphasized," which does not align with IARPA's goal of enhancing national security through cyber attribution technologies.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis
- **Evaluation of Methodology**: The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach that is rigorous for its field but does not meet the technical requirements of the IARPA grant, which demands strong theoretical foundations in cybersecurity.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The statistical and thematic analysis methods used in the dissertation are effective for evaluating sustainable chemical processes, yet they lack relevance to the data analysis techniques necessary for cybersecurity applications.

- **Examples**: The dissertation's focus on **“Experimental Laboratory Studies”** and **“Case Studies of Existing Sustainable Processes”** illustrates its commitment to rigorous research, but these methods do not translate to the context of cyber forensic analysis.

## 6. Writing and Structure
- **Quality of Writing**: The dissertation is well-organized and clear, with a logical flow of information. However, the clarity of the writing does not compensate for the lack of relevance to the grant's objectives.

- **Use of Citations and Figures**: The dissertation employs appropriate citations and includes figures that enhance understanding within the field of sustainable chemistry. However, these elements do not align with the standards and practices relevant to cybersecurity research.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
- **Actionable Recommendations**: To align the dissertation more closely with the IARPA grant objectives, the author could consider:
  - Integrating discussions on the implications of sustainable practices in technology development, particularly in cybersecurity.
  - Exploring the potential for chemical analysis techniques to inform data security measures.
  
- **Enhancing Quality and Impact**: These improvements could broaden the dissertation's appeal and relevance, enabling it to contribute to interdisciplinary dialogues between chemistry and cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion
- **Summary of Evaluation**: The dissertation presents a robust exploration of sustainable chemistry but lacks direct relevance to the IARPA grant focused on cybersecurity. While the research is significant within its field, it does not address the pressing needs outlined in the grant.

- **Final Assessment**: The dissertation's relevance to the grant is minimal, and while it offers valuable insights into sustainable practices, it does not contribute to the objectives of enhancing national security through innovative cyber forensic technologies. 25.132712364196777
