# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)" explores the intersection of neural networks and predictive modeling, aiming to enhance decision-making processes across various fields by integrating principles from both domains. The central research questions focus on how neural networks can inform PME, the emergence of new theoretical constructs from this integration, and the development of adaptive prediction models that can be empirically tested.

Overall, the dissertation presents a significant and innovative approach to predictive analytics. However, while it offers valuable insights into decision-making processes, its direct relevance to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant objectives—specifically the attribution of cyberattacks based on coding styles—may be limited. The IARPA's mission emphasizes the need for technologies that assist forensic experts in analyzing and attributing cyber threats, which diverges from the dissertation's focus on broad predictive capabilities and interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis.

The mission of IARPA is to advance national security through innovative research in cybersecurity and forensic analysis. While the dissertation contributes to the understanding of predictive models, it does not align closely with the specific objectives outlined in the SoURCE CODE program, particularly in the context of feature extraction and similarity analysis of coding styles. Therefore, while the dissertation is academically robust, it may not meet the grant's requirements for practical application in cybersecurity.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA SoURCE CODE program aims to develop technologies for analyzing coding styles and enhancing the attribution of cyberattacks. The dissertation's exploration of neural networks and PME does not directly address these specific objectives. 

- **Feature Space Generation and Extraction**: The dissertation does not propose methodologies for feature extraction relevant to coding styles, which is a fundamental focus of the grant. For example, while the dissertation discusses "adaptive prediction models," it lacks a direct application to coding features or binary analysis.

- **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms**: The dissertation emphasizes knowledge synthesis and adaptive prediction but does not provide algorithms or methodologies for identifying similarities in binary or source code files. A quote from the dissertation states, "By leveraging principles from neural networks...this research will develop an integrated approach to PME," but it does not engage with the technical specifics required for analyzing coding styles.

- **System Explainability**: Although the dissertation mentions the importance of "continuous learning frameworks," it does not address the explainability of systems, which is crucial for forensic experts in understanding the attribution of cyberattacks. The grant summary explicitly highlights the need for interpretable feedback, which the dissertation does not adequately cover.

In terms of quantitative measures, the dissertation's focus on interdisciplinary applications and theoretical constructs may fall into a lower relevance percentile for the grant's objectives. While it may be categorized under a broader cybersecurity framework, the lack of specific applications to coding style analysis suggests a misalignment with the grant's focus areas.

  - *Example*: "The focus on cognitive processes in PME diverges from the need for forensic analysis in cybersecurity."

### Conclusion of Perspectives
The dissertation presents a compelling theoretical framework but ultimately lacks the technical specificity and direct relevance required for the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant. It may serve as a foundation for future interdisciplinary work but does not align closely with the grant's objectives.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes to the fields of artificial intelligence and predictive analytics by proposing an integrated approach that combines neural network principles with PME. However, its contribution must be viewed in the context of the IARPA grant's focus on cybersecurity.

- **Comparison with Grant Objectives**: The grant emphasizes the need for practical applications in cyber forensics, while the dissertation focuses on theoretical constructs and adaptive models. A quote from the dissertation states, "The integration of neural networks and PME reveals several gaps in the current literature," but it does not address the specific gaps in cybersecurity that the grant seeks to fill.

- **Contrasting Findings**: The dissertation's findings on cognitive biases and knowledge synthesis do not directly translate into actionable insights for forensic experts. The grant summary highlights the need for systems that provide interpretable feedback, which is not a focus of the dissertation.

Overall, while the dissertation provides a valuable theoretical framework, its contribution to the field of cybersecurity, particularly in the context of the IARPA grant, is limited.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. However, the appropriateness of these methods in the context of the grant's requirements is questionable.

- **Research Design**: The mixed-methods approach is well-explained, but it lacks a clear connection to the technical needs of the SoURCE CODE program. The dissertation states, "Data collection will involve surveys and interviews with PME practitioners," but does not address how these methods would yield insights applicable to forensic analysis of cyberattacks.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The statistical analysis of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative data are sound; however, they do not align with the grant's emphasis on feature extraction and similarity analysis. The dissertation does not provide specific examples of how data analysis techniques could be applied to coding styles or binary representations.

- **Limitations**: While ethical considerations are addressed, the limitations of the research methodology in relation to the grant's objectives are not sufficiently discussed. The lack of empirical validation for the proposed models raises questions about their applicability in real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written and organized, demonstrating clarity and coherence in presenting complex ideas. However, its alignment with grant standards could be improved.

- **Quality of Writing**: The writing is articulate, with a logical flow of ideas. However, the technical depth required for a grant proposal is lacking in sections relevant to cybersecurity.

- **Use of Citations and Figures**: The dissertation includes appropriate citations, but the use of figures and tables could be enhanced to illustrate key concepts more effectively. The lack of visuals depicting the proposed models limits the reader's ability to understand their practical implications.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Focus on Practical Applications**: Incorporate specific methodologies for feature extraction and similarity analysis relevant to coding styles. This could include developing algorithms that directly address the grant's objectives.

- **Enhance Technical Depth**: Provide more detailed discussions on the technical aspects of neural network applications in cybersecurity. This could involve case studies or simulations that demonstrate the applicability of the proposed models in real-world scenarios.

- **Address Explainability**: Include a section on system explainability, focusing on how the proposed models can provide interpretable feedback to forensic experts. This aligns with the grant's emphasis on the importance of understanding the attribution process.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could significantly improve its alignment with the grant's objectives and enhance its overall impact.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation "Transposing Neural Networks to Prediction Matter Expertise" presents an innovative approach to predictive analytics, yet it lacks direct relevance to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant. While it contributes valuable theoretical insights to the fields of artificial intelligence and decision-making, its applicability to the specific objectives of the grant is limited. 

The dissertation's strengths lie in its interdisciplinary approach and the potential for future research. However, to better align with the grant's mission of enhancing cybersecurity through practical applications, the work would benefit from a more focused exploration of methodologies relevant to coding style analysis and forensic attribution. Overall, while the dissertation is academically robust, it may not fulfill the specific requirements set forth in the IARPA SoURCE CODE program. 34.041281938552856
