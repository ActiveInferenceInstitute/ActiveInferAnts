# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems" explores the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and ecosystem dynamics. It seeks to establish a transformative framework that integrates chemical principles into ecological studies, aiming to enhance understanding of biodiversity, resilience, and energy flow in ecosystems. The research questions focus on modeling ecosystems as systems of reactions, the role of keystone species as catalysts, and applying chemical equilibrium principles to biodiversity.

Overall, the work is well-conceived and presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that could enrich ecological theory and practice. However, in the context of the IARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) titled "Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments" (SoURCE CODE), the relevance of this dissertation is limited. The BAA primarily targets the development of technologies for cyberattack attribution through coding style analysis, which does not align with the ecological and chemical focus of this dissertation. 

The mission of IARPA is to enhance national security through innovative technologies, particularly in cybersecurity. Unfortunately, the dissertation does not address the objectives of the SoURCE CODE program, which centers on forensic analysis in cyber environments. Therefore, while the dissertation is a significant contribution to ecological research, it does not align with the grant's objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The SoURCE CODE program emphasizes the development of technologies for forensic analysis in cybersecurity, specifically focusing on coding styles and similarities in binary and source code files. The dissertation, however, centers on ecological dynamics and chemical principles, presenting a fundamental misalignment with the grant's focus areas.

### Key Misalignments:
- **Focus Areas**: The grant's focus areas include feature extraction and similarity analysis of coding styles, whereas the dissertation is rooted in ecological modeling and chemical interactions. For instance, the dissertation states, "By framing ecosystems as dynamic systems of reactions, we can analyze species interactions and energy transformations in a structured manner." This focus diverges significantly from the technical challenges outlined in the BAA.

- **Technical Objectives**: The BAA requires innovative solutions for forensic experts to attribute cyberattacks based on coding styles. In contrast, the dissertation proposes a framework for analyzing species interactions through chemical principles, with objectives such as "How can ecosystems be modeled as systems of reactions?" This question does not pertain to the grant's emphasis on cybersecurity.

- **Quantitative Measures**: A quantitative evaluation of relevance indicates a low alignment percentile, likely below 10%. The dissertation does not present any technology or methodologies applicable to the forensic analysis of cyberattacks, which is the primary objective of the SoURCE CODE program.

### Examples from Dissertation:
- The dissertation's executive summary states, "The integration of chemical reaction principles into ecological studies... has profound implications for our ability to manage and conserve ecosystems." This statement reflects the ecological focus rather than the cybersecurity emphasis of the grant.

- The research questions posed, such as "What role do keystone species play as catalysts in ecosystem dynamics?" are unrelated to the objectives of the SoURCE CODE program, which seeks to understand coding styles in cyber environments.

In conclusion, the dissertation exhibits a significant lack of relevance to the IARPA BAA's objectives, focusing instead on ecological and chemical principles that do not contribute to the development of technologies for cyberattack attribution.
