# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "The Shifted Domain: Fusing Chemical Reaction Principles with ATM Transaction Processes"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "The Shifted Domain: Fusing Chemical Reaction Principles with ATM Transaction Processes" explores the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and ATM transaction processes. It aims to enhance ATM functionalities, improve user experiences, and optimize transaction flows through a novel framework. The overarching research questions focus on applying chemical catalysis to ATM systems, maintaining transaction equilibrium, and leveraging machine learning for cash management.

Overall, the work presents a unique interdisciplinary approach, which, while innovative, does not align closely with the objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant. The grant focuses specifically on developing technologies for cybersecurity and cyberattack attribution, which is distinct from the financial technology domain addressed in the dissertation. The mission of IARPA is to enhance national security through innovative cyber solutions, and this dissertation, while intellectually stimulating, falls outside the scope of the grant’s focus areas.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA SoURCE CODE program emphasizes the development of technologies for forensic experts to attribute cyberattacks based on coding styles, which includes feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability. The dissertation, however, primarily investigates the application of chemical principles to enhance ATM transactions, which does not directly contribute to the goals of cyber threat attribution.

### Specific Examples:
- The dissertation proposes that "principles of chemical catalysis can be applied to enhance ATM user interfaces and transaction speeds." This focus on user interface design and transaction efficiency does not address the grant’s objectives concerning cyber forensic analysis.
- The dissertation's exploration of "transaction equilibrium in high-traffic ATM locations" is unrelated to the requirement for developing systems that provide insights into the origins of cyberattacks.

### Quantitative Measures:
- Given the focus on financial technology rather than cybersecurity, the relevance percentile for the dissertation in relation to IARPA’s objectives may be estimated at less than 10%. The dissertation does not provide insights or methodologies applicable to the field of cybersecurity, making it largely irrelevant for the grant.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive Perspective:
- **Interdisciplinary Innovation:** The dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that merges chemistry and financial technology, which could inspire innovative methodologies in other fields.
  
### Positive Perspective:
- **User-Centric Design:** The emphasis on improving user experience in ATM transactions through chemical principles may offer insights applicable in user interface design across various domains.

### Neutral Perspective:
- **Limited Applicability:** While the research is well-structured, its applicability to the field of cybersecurity is limited, making it less relevant to the grant's focus.

### Negative Perspective:
- **Lack of Cybersecurity Focus:** The dissertation fails to address any aspects of cybersecurity or forensic analysis, which are critical components of the IARPA grant objectives.

### Strongly Negative Perspective:
- **Misalignment with Grant Objectives:** The entire premise of the dissertation does not align with the goals of enhancing forensic capabilities in cybersecurity, rendering it irrelevant to the grant.

### Overall Rationale:
The dissertation's innovative approach to financial technology and user experience does not translate into contributions to the field of cybersecurity, which is the primary focus of the IARPA grant. The research questions and methodologies are misaligned with the objectives of enhancing national security through cyber threat attribution.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the field of financial technology by proposing a framework that applies chemical principles to enhance ATM transaction processes. This interdisciplinary approach challenges existing paradigms and opens avenues for further research in user experience and transaction optimization.

### Comparison with Grant Focus:
- The grant seeks to develop technologies that assist in the attribution of cyberattacks, focusing on coding styles and forensic analysis, while the dissertation focuses on user-centric design in ATM transactions. 
- For example, the dissertation states, “the implications of this research extend beyond ATM systems, potentially influencing various sectors within financial technology,” which contrasts sharply with the grant’s aim to enhance cybersecurity capabilities.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes:
- Dissertation: “This research is significant because it bridges two traditionally distinct fields.”
- Grant: “The program aims to develop technologies that can provide insights into the likely origins of attacks.”

This juxtaposition highlights the distinct focus areas of the dissertation and the grant, reinforcing the conclusion that the dissertation does not contribute to the objectives of the IARPA program.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to analyze ATM transaction processes through the lens of chemical principles. While the methodology is robust for its intended focus, it lacks rigor in addressing cybersecurity concerns, which are central to the IARPA grant.

### Evaluation of Methodology:
- The use of surveys and interviews to gather user feedback on ATM interactions is appropriate for the study's aims. However, it does not incorporate methodologies relevant to cybersecurity analysis or forensic investigation.

### Data Analysis Techniques:
- Statistical analysis of transaction times and user satisfaction metrics is effective for the study but does not align with the data analysis required for cybersecurity applications, such as feature extraction or similarity analysis.

### Limitations:
- The absence of cybersecurity-focused methodologies limits the dissertation’s relevance to the IARPA grant, as it does not address the technical challenges outlined in the grant summary.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written, with clear organization and logical flow. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables effectively illustrate key points.

### Quality of Writing:
- The writing is clear and concise, making complex ideas accessible. However, the focus remains on financial technology rather than cybersecurity, which detracts from its relevance to the grant.

### Use of Figures and Tables:
- The dissertation includes tables that summarize gaps and opportunities, which are helpful for understanding the research context. However, these are not applicable to the IARPA’s objectives.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To better align the dissertation with the IARPA grant objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Incorporate Cybersecurity Elements:** Introduce a section that explores how the proposed frameworks could be applied to enhance cybersecurity measures in financial transactions.
   - Example Quote from Grant: “The goal is to develop technologies that can provide insights into the likely origins of attacks.”

2. **Focus on Forensic Analysis:** Include methodologies for analyzing transaction data in a manner that could contribute to forensic investigations, such as identifying patterns that may correlate with cyber threats.

3. **Expand Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Foster collaborations with cybersecurity experts to explore the intersection of chemical principles and cyber forensic analysis.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could enhance its relevance to the IARPA grant and contribute to the field of cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation "The Shifted Domain: Fusing Chemical Reaction Principles with ATM Transaction Processes" presents an innovative interdisciplinary approach that significantly contributes to financial technology. However, it does not align with the objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, which focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through forensic analysis of coding styles. 

While the strengths of the dissertation lie in its unique methodology and potential applications in financial technology, the lack of relevance to cybersecurity limits its alignment with the grant’s mission. The recommendations provided could help bridge this gap, potentially enhancing the dissertation’s impact in the broader context of national security. 18.244969844818115
