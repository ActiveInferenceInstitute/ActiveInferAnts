# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Ecosystem Dynamics"

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Ecosystem Dynamics" investigates the intersection between neural networks and ecosystem dynamics, proposing a framework called Neuro-Ecological Systems Theory (NEST). The central research questions focus on how neural network principles can be applied to understand ecosystem dynamics, the learning behaviors of ecosystems, and the role of keystone species as neural hubs. The overall impression of this work is that it presents an innovative perspective that bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering potential insights for conservation strategies and ecological management.

In the context of the IARPA grant titled "Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments" (SoURCE CODE), the dissertation's relevance is limited. While both the dissertation and the grant emphasize the importance of complex systems, the dissertation's focus on ecological systems and neural networks does not align with the grant's primary objectives of enhancing cyber threat attribution through coding style analysis. IARPA's mission is to develop technologies for forensic analysis in cyber environments, which diverges from the ecological and theoretical focus of the dissertation. 

### Key Mission Alignment:
- **IARPA Mission**: Develop technologies for cyber threat attribution.
- **Dissertation Focus**: Ecological dynamics through neural network principles.
- **Overall Assessment**: Limited relevance to the grant's objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The IARPA grant aims to develop technologies to assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks based on coding styles, focusing on feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability. The dissertation, however, centers on ecological systems and their dynamics through the lens of neural networks, which diverges significantly from the grant's focus areas.

### Specific Examples of Divergence:
- **Coding Styles vs. Ecosystem Dynamics**: The dissertation's exploration of "how ecosystems can be conceptualized as dynamic networks capable of learning and adapting to disturbances" (p. 5) does not address any aspect of coding styles or cyber environments.
- **Feature Extraction**: The grant emphasizes developing methods for feature extraction from source code and binaries, while the dissertation discusses ecological plasticity and interconnectivity, stating, "Ecosystems demonstrate remarkable adaptability through various mechanisms" (p. 27). This does not contribute to the technological innovations sought by the grant.
- **System Explainability**: The grant requires systems that provide interpretable feedback to forensic experts. In contrast, the dissertation focuses on ecological resilience and adaptability, with no mention of explainability in the context of cyber forensics.

### Quantitative Measures:
- **Funding/Relevance Percentiles**: Given the focus areas, the dissertation would likely score low on relevance percentiles for IARPA's objectives, potentially in the 10-20% range, as it does not contribute to the technological advancements needed for cyber threat attribution.
