# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation for Grant Relevance

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled **"Transposition of Neural Networks to Quantum Computation"** explores the innovative intersection of neural networks and quantum computation, referred to as the "Shifted Domain." The research seeks to transpose principles from neural networks into quantum computing to develop novel quantum neural networks that leverage quantum phenomena for enhanced learning and processing capabilities. The overarching research questions focus on the effective integration of neural network principles into quantum computation, implications for learning algorithms, and performance comparisons between quantum and classical models.

Overall, this dissertation presents a significant theoretical contribution to the fields of machine learning and quantum computation. However, its relevance to the **IARPA Broad Agency Announcement: Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments (SoURCE CODE)** is limited. While the dissertation addresses advanced computational techniques, it does not directly align with the grant’s objectives of enhancing forensic capabilities in cyberattack attribution through coding style analysis. The key mission of IARPA is to develop technologies that assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks, which is not a central focus of this dissertation. Therefore, while the dissertation is innovative, it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the grant.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The SoURCE CODE program aims to develop technologies for automating the attribution of cyberattacks by analyzing coding styles and similarities in binary and source code files. The key focus areas include feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability. 

### Alignment with Grant Objectives
- **Feature Space Generation and Extraction**: The dissertation proposes the development of quantum neural networks that could theoretically enhance feature extraction capabilities. For instance, the section on "Quantum Synaptic Plasticity" suggests that "quantum connections can adapt based on the history of computations," which could be relevant for creating more nuanced feature representations. However, it lacks direct application to coding style analysis.
- **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms**: While the dissertation discusses similarities in data processing, it does not address the specific need for demographic inference or coding style matching which is central to the grant’s objectives. There is no mention of how quantum neural networks could be used to identify similar binaries or infer demographic information about authors.
- **System Explainability**: The dissertation emphasizes the importance of explainability in quantum neural networks but does not connect this to the needs of forensic experts in cyber environments. The grant requires systems to provide interpretable feedback, yet the dissertation focuses on theoretical constructs without practical implementations relevant to cyber forensics.

### Quantitative Measures
Given the focus areas of the grant, the dissertation's relevance can be quantitatively assessed:
- **Funding Relevance Percentile**: Based on the objectives of the SoURCE CODE program, the dissertation's alignment with the grant's focus areas could be rated at approximately **20%** relevance. This low percentile reflects the lack of direct applications to cyber forensics, despite its innovative contributions to quantum computation.

In summary, while the dissertation contributes to the fields of machine learning and quantum computation, its relevance to the specific aims of the IARPA grant is minimal.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

For example, it fails to explore how quantum neural networks could assist forensic experts in analyzing coding styles, which is a critical component of the grant’s mission.

### Critical Perspective
- **Ethical Considerations**: The dissertation discusses ethical implications but does not connect these to the responsible use of advanced AI in cybersecurity. Given the grant's emphasis on national security, this oversight is significant.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a notable contribution to the fields of machine learning and quantum computation. It proposes a new computational paradigm that integrates neural network principles with quantum mechanics. The theoretical constructs, such as quantum synaptic plasticity, could lead to advancements in learning algorithms.

### Comparison with Grant Focus Areas
- The grant emphasizes the need for innovative technologies in cyber forensics, specifically in coding style analysis. In contrast, the dissertation focuses on the theoretical development of quantum neural networks without practical applications to forensic analysis. 
- For instance, the dissertation states, "By identifying synergies between the two fields, we can develop theoretical frameworks and practical applications," yet it fails to provide specific frameworks applicable to the grant’s focus on cyberattack attribution.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes
- Dissertation: "The lack of research on integrating neural network principles into quantum computing presents a unique opportunity to explore the Shifted Domain."
- Grant: "The goal is to develop technologies that can provide insights into the likely origins of attacks."
  
The gap between these statements highlights the dissertation's theoretical focus versus the grant's practical application needs.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical modeling, simulations, and empirical experiments. However, the methodology lacks a direct connection to the practical needs of the SoURCE CODE program.

### Methodological Rigor
- The theoretical modeling of quantum neural networks is well-articulated, but the lack of empirical validation in a cybersecurity context limits its applicability. The methodology section states, "Empirical studies will be conducted to compare the performance of quantum algorithms," yet it does not specify how these algorithms would relate to cyberattack attribution.

### Data Analysis Techniques
- The statistical analysis proposed is robust for theoretical models, but the absence of data collection methods relevant to coding style analysis is a significant limitation. The dissertation does not provide examples of how data from cyber environments would be collected or analyzed.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written, with clear organization and logical flow. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables effectively illustrate key concepts. However, the writing could benefit from a stronger emphasis on practical applications relevant to the grant.

### Clarity and Organization
- The structure is coherent, with clear sections outlining the research framework and methodology. However, the lack of direct relevance to the grant’s objectives may confuse readers about the practical implications of the research.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
