# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the integration of neural network principles with guest experience management in the hospitality sector. The primary research questions focus on how neural network concepts can enhance the understanding of guest experiences, the implications for staff training and service delivery, and how hospitality businesses can leverage guest data to create adaptive service models. 

Overall, the dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that merges neuroscience with hospitality management, which is commendable. However, this work does not align with the objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, which is focused on developing innovative technologies for cyberattack attribution based on coding styles. The key mission of IARPA is to enhance national security through improved forensic analysis of cyber threats, while the dissertation is situated within the context of service delivery and customer experience in hospitality. Thus, the relevance of this dissertation to the grant is minimal.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA SoURCE CODE grant emphasizes developing technologies to assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks by analyzing coding styles. The objectives include feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability in the context of cybersecurity. The dissertation, however, is centered on enhancing guest experiences in hospitality through neural network concepts, which does not directly address the grant's focus areas.

### Specific Examples from the Dissertation:
- The dissertation states, "By leveraging neural network concepts, this research aims to provide a theoretical and practical framework for enhancing guest experiences through adaptive service delivery." This objective does not intersect with any of the grant's goals related to cybersecurity or forensic analysis.
- The proposed "Guest Experience Neural Model" focuses on staff interactions and guest data but does not incorporate any aspects of coding or cyber threat analysis.

### Quantitative Measures:
- **Funding Alignment Percentile:** Given the focused nature of the IARPA grant, the dissertation's relevance can be quantitatively assessed as below 10% in terms of alignment with grant objectives. The methodologies and applications discussed in the dissertation do not apply to the technical challenges outlined in the grant.

In summary, the dissertation lacks direct relevance to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant's objectives, which focus on cyber threat attribution rather than service delivery in hospitality.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive Perspective:
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The integration of neural network concepts with guest experience management is innovative and reflects a strong grasp of interdisciplinary research.
  
### Positive Perspective:
- **Theoretical Framework:** The proposed "Guest Experience Neural Model" is well-structured and could lead to advancements in understanding guest behaviors, although not applicable to the grant's objectives.

### Neutral Perspective:
- **Research Methodology:** The mixed-methods approach is sound for hospitality research but does not employ methodologies relevant to cybersecurity analysis.

### Negative Perspective:
- **Lack of Cybersecurity Focus:** The research does not address any of the technical challenges or objectives outlined in the IARPA grant, limiting its applicability to the grant's mission.

### Strongly Negative Perspective:
- **Misalignment with Grant Goals:** The entire dissertation is misaligned with the IARPA grant's focus on cyberattacks, making it unsuitable for funding consideration.

### Final Perspective:
- **Limited Practical Application:** While the dissertation contributes to hospitality management, its findings and frameworks do not translate to the needs of forensic experts in cybersecurity, which is the primary goal of the IARPA grant.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the fields of hospitality management and neuroscience by proposing a framework that integrates neural network concepts into guest experience management. The findings suggest that applying neural network principles can enhance personalization and service delivery in hospitality.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives:
- The grant aims to develop technologies for cyberattack attribution, while the dissertation focuses on enhancing guest satisfaction through adaptive service models. For example, the dissertation states, "By viewing guest experiences through this lens, hospitality businesses can develop adaptive service strategies that respond to guest needs and preferences." This focus on guest experience does not intersect with the grant's objectives of improving forensic analysis.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes:
- **Dissertation:** "The integration of technology into service delivery has also led to the emergence of new business models."
- **Grant Summary:** "The program aims to ensure that research outcomes are well-characterized and aligned with program objectives." The dissertation's focus on service delivery does not align with the grant's emphasis on cybersecurity innovations.

In conclusion, while the dissertation makes a valuable contribution to its field, it does not address the objectives of the IARPA grant.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods research design, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the integration of neural network principles into guest experience management. 

### Appropriateness and Rigor:
- The use of surveys and interviews is appropriate for understanding guest and staff perspectives. However, these methods do not align with the data analysis techniques required for cybersecurity research, such as feature extraction and similarity analysis.

### Data Analysis Techniques:
- The dissertation utilizes statistical methods for quantitative data analysis and thematic analysis for qualitative data. While effective for hospitality research, these techniques are not relevant to the technical challenges outlined in the IARPA grant.

### Limitations:
- The primary limitation of the methodology is its lack of focus on technical aspects relevant to cybersecurity, which are critical for the objectives of the IARPA grant.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written, with a clear structure that guides the reader through the research process. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables are effectively employed to illustrate key concepts.

### Clarity and Organization:
- The dissertation's organization aids in understanding the complex interplay between neural networks and guest experience management. However, the clarity of the writing does not compensate for the lack of alignment with the grant's objectives.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the IARPA grant objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Incorporate Cybersecurity Themes:** Introduce elements of cybersecurity and forensic analysis to create a cross-disciplinary framework that aligns with the IARPA grant.
  
2. **Focus on Technical Methodologies:** Adapt the research methodology to include techniques relevant to coding style analysis and feature extraction, which are central to the grant's objectives.

3. **Engage with Cybersecurity Experts:** Collaborate with cybersecurity professionals to explore how neural network principles can be applied to enhance forensic analysis and cyber threat attribution.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could better align with the IARPA grant's objectives and contribute to the field of cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation presents a novel exploration of integrating neural network concepts into hospitality management. While it makes valuable contributions to its field, it lacks direct relevance to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, which focuses on cybersecurity and forensic analysis. The dissertation's strengths lie in its interdisciplinary approach and theoretical framework, but the misalignment with the grant's objectives limits its applicability. Overall, while the work is commendable, it does not meet the specific needs of the grant and would require significant revisions to align with IARPA's mission. 24.823433876037598
