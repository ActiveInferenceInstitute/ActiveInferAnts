# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks into the Fabric Industry and Arts"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks into the Fabric Industry and Arts" explores the innovative intersection of artificial intelligence and textile design, aiming to redefine how fabrics are created and interact with users. The central research questions focus on the integration of neural network principles into textile design, the impact of adaptive textiles on consumer satisfaction and sustainability, and the potential for feedback mechanisms to reshape the design process. The overall impression of the work is that it is a compelling interdisciplinary exploration, but it lacks direct relevance to the objectives of the IARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) focused on cybersecurity and forensic analysis.

The mission of IARPA is to enhance national security through innovative technologies that improve the attribution of cyberattacks. This dissertation, while innovative within its domain, does not align with the specific objectives of the SoURCE CODE program, which seeks to develop technologies for analyzing coding styles and enhancing forensic capabilities in cyber environments. Therefore, while the dissertation presents significant contributions to the fields of textile design and artificial intelligence, it is not relevant to the grant's focus areas.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA SoURCE CODE program emphasizes the development of technologies for forensic analysis of cyberattacks, specifically through coding styles and binary analysis. The dissertation, however, centers on the application of neural networks to textiles, which does not intersect with the technical challenges outlined in the grant. 

### Alignment with Grant Goals
- **Feature Space Generation and Extraction:** The dissertation does not explore coding styles or feature extraction relevant to programming or binary files. Instead, it discusses fabric properties and design aesthetics, which are not applicable to the SoURCE CODE objectives.
  
- **Similarity and Demographic Analytic Algorithms:** There is no discussion of algorithms that could identify similarities in coding practices or infer demographic information about authors of code, as required by the grant. The focus on textiles is far removed from the computational analysis of code.

- **System Explainability:** While the dissertation does touch on user interaction and feedback mechanisms, these concepts are not relevant to the explainability of systems in the context of cyber forensics.

### Quantitative Measures
The dissertation could be rated at a low relevance percentile (e.g., <10%) concerning the grant's objectives. There are no quantitative measures or methodologies discussed that would apply to the analysis of coding styles or forensic technologies, which are central to the SoURCE CODE program.

### Specific Examples
The dissertation emphasizes the creation of "adaptive textiles" and their impact on consumer engagement, stating, "the application of neural network principles allows for a paradigm shift where textiles can evolve based on user interaction." This focus on user experience and material interaction diverges significantly from the grantâ€™s focus on cyber threat attribution.
