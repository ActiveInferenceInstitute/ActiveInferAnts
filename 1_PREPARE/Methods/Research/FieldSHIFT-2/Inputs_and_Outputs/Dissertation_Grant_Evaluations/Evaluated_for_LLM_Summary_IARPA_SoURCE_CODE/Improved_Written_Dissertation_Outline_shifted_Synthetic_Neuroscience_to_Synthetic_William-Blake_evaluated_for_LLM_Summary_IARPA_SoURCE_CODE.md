# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation for IARPA Grant Relevance

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and literary analysis, specifically focusing on the works of William Blake. The primary research questions investigate how Blake's themes can be modeled as neural networks, the dynamics of neural communication in understanding his artistic expression, and the interdisciplinary implications for neuroscience, literary studies, and education. 

Overall, the dissertation presents an innovative approach that merges cognitive science with literary analysis. However, in the context of the IARPA grant titled "Securing Our Underlying Resources in Cyber Environments" (SoURCE CODE), which aims to develop technologies for attributing cyberattacks based on coding styles, the dissertation appears to lack direct relevance. The grant's objectives focus on forensic analysis and cybersecurity, while the dissertation explores artistic and cognitive dimensions unrelated to cyber threats or their attribution.

The mission of IARPA is to enhance national security through innovative research in cybersecurity. Given this focus, the dissertation does not align with the grant's objectives, as it does not address any of the technical challenges or areas of interest outlined in the SoURCE CODE program.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The SoURCE CODE program emphasizes the need for innovative technologies that assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks based on coding styles. The focus areas include feature extraction, similarity analysis, and system explainability. The dissertation, however, delves into a theoretical exploration of neural networks in the context of literary analysis, which is fundamentally different from the technical and practical applications sought by the IARPA grant.

### Specific Examples from the Dissertation
- The dissertation proposes a framework for understanding Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements, stating, "By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work..." This focus on literary themes does not address the grant's emphasis on coding styles or cyber forensics.
- The proposed integrated theoretical model visualizes Blake's themes as a neural network, which, while innovative, lacks applicability to the technical challenges posed by the IARPA grant.

### Quantitative Measures
- The dissertation's relevance to the IARPA grant can be quantitatively assessed by examining the focus areas of the grant against the dissertation's objectives. The grant emphasizes forensic analysis and cybersecurity, while the dissertation focuses on cognitive processes in art, yielding a relevance percentile of approximately 10%. This indicates minimal alignment with the grant's objectives.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: The integration of neuroscience and literature is innovative and could inspire future research in cognitive dimensions of artistic engagement.

### Positive
- **Theoretical Framework**: The dissertation presents a solid theoretical framework that could be valuable in interdisciplinary studies, albeit outside the scope of the grant.

### Neutral
- **Literary Analysis**: While the literary analysis is thorough, it does not contribute to the objectives of the IARPA grant, which focuses on technical applications.

### Negative
- **Lack of Technical Relevance**: The dissertation does not address any of the technical challenges outlined in the grant, such as feature extraction or similarity analysis.

### Strongly Negative
- **Absence of Cybersecurity Context**: The work fails to engage with any concepts relevant to cybersecurity or forensic analysis, which are the primary objectives of the IARPA grant.

### Overall Rationale
The dissertation, while academically rigorous and innovative, ultimately does not fulfill the criteria set forth by the IARPA grant. The focus on artistic and cognitive dimensions is too far removed from the technical and practical needs of cybersecurity and forensic analysis.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the fields of cognitive science and literary studies by proposing a novel interdisciplinary framework. It challenges conventional boundaries and invites scholars to consider cognitive processes in artistic creation. However, when viewed through the lens of the IARPA grant's objectives, the contribution appears limited.

### Comparison with Grant's Focus Areas
- The grant emphasizes the development of technologies for forensic analysis, while the dissertation focuses on cognitive engagement with literature. For example, the dissertation states, "This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two traditionally distinct fields," which does not align with the grant's emphasis on technical solutions for cyber attribution.
- The grant seeks innovations in feature extraction and similarity analysis, whereas the dissertation's exploration of "thematic neurons" and "cognitive resonance" lacks direct applicability to these focus areas.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. This methodology is appropriate for its objectives but does not align with the technical requirements of the IARPA grant.

### Effectiveness of Data Analysis Techniques
- The qualitative analysis effectively explores thematic connections in Blake's work, but the lack of quantitative measures relevant to coding styles or cyber forensics limits its applicability to the grant's objectives.
- The dissertation mentions ethical considerations in data collection, which is commendable but not relevant to the technical aspects of the IARPA grant.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-structured and clearly written, with a logical flow of ideas. The use of citations, figures, and tables is appropriate for the academic context. However, the clarity of writing and organization does not compensate for the lack of relevance to the IARPA grant.

### Citations and Figures
- The dissertation effectively utilizes citations to support its arguments, but the absence of references to cybersecurity or forensic analysis diminishes its alignment with the grant's objectives.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To better align the dissertation with the IARPA grant's objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:
- **Incorporate Cybersecurity Context**: Integrate discussions on how cognitive processes could enhance understanding of coding styles or forensic analysis.
- **Focus on Practical Applications**: Develop sections that explore potential applications of the interdisciplinary framework in cybersecurity contexts.
- **Engage with Technical Challenges**: Address specific technical challenges outlined in the grant, such as feature extraction and similarity analysis, to demonstrate relevance.

These improvements would enhance the overall quality and impact of the work by bridging the gap between cognitive science and cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, while the dissertation presents a rigorous and innovative exploration of the intersection between neural networks and literary analysis, it lacks direct relevance to the objectives of the IARPA grant. The focus on cognitive dimensions of artistic engagement does not align with the technical and practical needs of forensic analysis in cybersecurity. The dissertation's contributions to the fields of cognitive science and literary studies are commendable, but substantial revisions would be necessary to align it with the goals of the SoURCE CODE program. 23.80008316040039
