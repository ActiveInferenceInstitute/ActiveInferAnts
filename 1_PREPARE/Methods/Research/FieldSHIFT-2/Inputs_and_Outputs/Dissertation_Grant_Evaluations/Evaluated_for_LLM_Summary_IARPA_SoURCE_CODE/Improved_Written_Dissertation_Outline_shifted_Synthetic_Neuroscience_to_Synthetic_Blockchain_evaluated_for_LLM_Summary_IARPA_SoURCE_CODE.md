# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to Blockchain" in the Context of IARPA SoURCE CODE Grant

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to Blockchain" explores the integration of neural network principles into blockchain technology, coining the term "Neurochain." The research primarily investigates how neural networks can enhance the functionality, scalability, and adaptability of blockchain systems. Key research questions include the development of adaptive consensus mechanisms and the creation of smart contracts that learn from historical data. 

Overall, the dissertation presents a compelling exploration of an interdisciplinary approach that could potentially address significant challenges in blockchain technology. While the dissertation does not directly align with the specific objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, which focuses on cyber forensics and attribution of cyberattacks, it offers innovative methodologies that could indirectly inform future research within cybersecurity contexts. The mission of IARPA is to develop advanced technologies for national security, and while the dissertation does not target cyber attribution directly, its focus on enhancing blockchain technology could have implications for secure data management in cybersecurity.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA SoURCE CODE program aims to develop technologies that assist forensic experts in attributing cyberattacks by analyzing coding styles. Although the dissertation's focus is on enhancing blockchain technology through neural networks, there are several aspects that could be relevant to the grant's objectives:

- **Adaptive Consensus Mechanisms:** The dissertation proposes adaptive consensus mechanisms based on neural plasticity. This concept could inform the development of more efficient systems for analyzing code and detecting similarities, a key area of interest in the SoURCE CODE program. For instance, the dissertation states, "the hypothesis that adaptive consensus improves transaction validation speed and energy efficiency will be tested through simulation modeling." This insight could be translated into more efficient algorithms for code attribution.

- **Smart Contracts with Learning Capabilities:** The research discusses the development of smart contracts that adapt based on historical interactions. The ability of smart contracts to learn could be utilized in forensic applications, potentially allowing for the identification of patterns in coding styles associated with cyberattacks. The dissertation claims, "learning smart contracts increase transaction success rates and user satisfaction," which can be interpreted as a parallel to improving the accuracy of cyber attribution systems.

- **Interoperability Solutions:** The dissertation addresses challenges in blockchain interoperability, proposing a neuro-inspired framework for enhancing communication between blockchains. This aspect could be relevant for developing systems that require data sharing among various cybersecurity platforms, potentially aiding forensic investigations.

Quantitatively, while the dissertation's direct relevance to the grant's focus on cyber attribution is limited, it scores a moderate relevance percentile of around 45%, given its innovative approaches that could influence future research in cybersecurity.

### Overall Rationale
The dissertation presents innovative concepts that could contribute to the fields of AI and blockchain. However, its relevance to the specific objectives of the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant is limited, primarily due to a lack of focus on cyber attribution methodologies.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the fields of neural networks and blockchain technology by proposing the Neurochain framework. This framework addresses scalability and adaptability issues in blockchain systems, which are critical in the context of evolving cyber threats.

- **Comparison with Grant Objectives:** The IARPA grant emphasizes the need for innovative technologies to improve cyber threat attribution. The dissertation's focus on adaptive systems could inform future methodologies for analyzing coding styles. For example, the dissertation asserts, "the integration of learning mechanisms into blockchain systems has the potential to transform their functionality," which could be relevant for developing more sophisticated cyber attribution techniques.

- **Juxtaposition of Findings:** The dissertation highlights the limitations of current blockchain systems, stating, "existing consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake have been scrutinized for their inefficiencies." This critique aligns with the grant's objective to improve forensic analysis through innovative technologies.

Overall, while the dissertation contributes to the understanding of blockchain and neural networks, its direct impact on the field of cybersecurity and the grant's objectives remains limited.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of neural networks and blockchain technology. 

- **Appropriateness of Methodology:** The mixed-methods design is appropriate for addressing the complex nature of the research questions. The dissertation states, "this design will enable a holistic examination of the integration of neural networks and blockchain technology," which reflects a comprehensive approach.

- **Data Analysis Techniques:** The dissertation utilizes simulation modeling to evaluate the proposed adaptive consensus mechanisms. However, the effectiveness of these techniques could be enhanced by incorporating more robust statistical analyses. The reviewer notes, "while simulation modeling is valuable, additional quantitative metrics could strengthen the findings."

- **Limitations:** The dissertation acknowledges limitations in data collection, particularly regarding the diversity of blockchain implementations. The statement, "measures will be taken to ensure data privacy and security," highlights ethical considerations but also points to potential gaps in data representation.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The overall quality of writing in the dissertation is clear and organized, with a logical flow of ideas. 

- **Clarity and Organization:** The dissertation is well-structured, with distinct sections that facilitate understanding. The introduction effectively outlines the research questions and objectives.

- **Use of Citations, Figures, and Tables:** The dissertation employs citations appropriately, referencing key literature in both fields. However, the inclusion of more figures and tables could enhance the presentation of complex concepts. The reviewer comments, "visual aids would improve the reader's comprehension of intricate frameworks."

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the relevance of the dissertation to the IARPA SoURCE CODE grant, the following actionable recommendations are proposed:

1. **Focus on Cybersecurity Applications:** Incorporate a dedicated section that explicitly connects the Neurochain framework to cybersecurity applications, particularly in cyber attribution.

2. **Develop Case Studies:** Include case studies that demonstrate the application of adaptive consensus mechanisms in real-world cybersecurity scenarios, which would provide practical insights.

3. **Enhance Data Analysis:** Utilize more robust statistical analyses alongside simulation modeling to strengthen the empirical findings.
