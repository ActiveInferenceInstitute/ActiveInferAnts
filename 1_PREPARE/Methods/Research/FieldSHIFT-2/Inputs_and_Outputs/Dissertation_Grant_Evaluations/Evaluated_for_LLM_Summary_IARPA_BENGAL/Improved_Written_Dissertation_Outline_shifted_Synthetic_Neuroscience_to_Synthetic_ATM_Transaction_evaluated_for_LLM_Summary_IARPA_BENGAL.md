# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions in Relation to the BENGAL Grant

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions" investigates the intersection of neural network principles and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) technologies, aiming to enhance user experience and operational efficiency in banking. The research questions focus on how to effectively integrate neural network concepts into ATM systems, the implications of adaptive interfaces on user satisfaction, and the potential for predictive algorithms to improve cash management in ATM networks. 

Overall, the work presents a novel approach to ATM design that aligns with the objectives of the BENGAL grant, which seeks to address biases and limitations in generative AI technologies. While the dissertation does not directly address generative AI, the underlying principles of adaptive learning and user interaction can contribute valuable insights into mitigating biases in AI systems. The mission of IARPA is to invest in high-risk, high-payoff research that can provide the U.S. with a significant intelligence advantage. This dissertation aligns with that mission by proposing innovative solutions that could enhance the safety and effectiveness of AI applications within the Intelligence Community (IC).

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The BENGAL grant focuses on understanding and mitigating biases in generative AI technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). Although the dissertation centers on ATM transactions, its exploration of adaptive systems and user interfaces can provide insights applicable to the development of more robust AI technologies. 

### Alignment with Grant Objectives

For instance, the dissertation states, "By integrating neural principles into ATM design, we can create systems that not only respond to user inputs but also learn and evolve based on user behavior." This adaptability could inform methods for AI systems to recognize and adjust for biases in user interactions.

- **AI Hallucinations and Inferences**: The research highlights the importance of predictive algorithms in cash management, suggesting that similar algorithms could be applied to AI systems to improve inference accuracy and reduce instances of "hallucinations." The dissertation notes, "Machine learning techniques will be utilized to develop predictive algorithms for cash management," which could be extended to enhance the reliability of AI outputs.

- **Safe Information Flow in Sensitive Environments**: The dissertation's emphasis on security innovations, particularly in biometric authentication, aligns with the grant's objective of ensuring safe information flow within sensitive environments. The exploration of "biometric authentication systems inspired by neural recognition processes" could provide insights into secure user interactions with AI technologies.

### Quantitative Measures
In evaluating the relevance of the dissertation to the BENGAL grant, one might consider the funding/relevance percentiles. Given the innovative approach and potential applications of the research, it could be positioned in the 70-80th percentile for relevance, as it offers foundational insights that could be adapted for generative AI contexts.
