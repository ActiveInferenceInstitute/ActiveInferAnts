# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation Relevance to BENGAL Grant

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Neurochemical Dynamics: A Novel Framework for Understanding Neural Networks through Chemical Reaction Principles" proposes an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates chemical reaction principles with neural network dynamics. It explores how neurotransmitters function as catalysts, modulating synaptic efficiency and plasticity, thereby providing insights into neural function, learning mechanisms, and potential therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. The overarching research questions focus on the application of chemical principles to neural processes, the catalytic role of neurotransmitters, and the implications for neurodegenerative diseases.

Overall, this work presents a compelling framework that aligns with the objectives of the BENGAL grant, particularly in its focus on understanding biases and limitations in generative AI technologies. While the primary focus of the dissertation is on neuroscience and chemistry, the interdisciplinary approach and emphasis on dynamic systems can contribute valuable insights into the challenges associated with biases in large language models (LLMs) as outlined in the grant's objectives.

The mission of IARPA emphasizes high-risk, high-payoff research that provides a significant intelligence advantage to the U.S. The dissertation aligns with this mission by fostering innovative thinking and interdisciplinary collaboration, although it does not directly address generative AI or biases therein.

This concept could parallel the development of strategies to identify and mitigate biases in AI outputs by understanding how different inputs (akin to neurotransmitters) influence the overall behavior of the system. For example, the dissertation states, "Neurotransmitters function as catalysts that modulate synaptic efficiency and plasticity," highlighting the importance of diverse inputs in shaping outcomes.

- **AI Hallucinations and Inferences:** The dissertation's focus on neural plasticity and the dynamics of neurotransmitter interactions could provide insights into how LLMs might manage conflicting information or "hallucinations." The exploration of "dynamic equilibrium" in neural circuits offers a potential framework for developing AI systems that can better handle uncertainty and variability in data.

- **Safe Information Flow in Sensitive Environments:** By understanding how neural circuits maintain homeostasis amidst dynamic inputs, the dissertation provides a foundation for developing AI systems that can ensure safe and reliable information flow, especially in sensitive environments. The research states, "Neural circuits maintain a dynamic equilibrium through feedback mechanisms," which could inform the design of AI systems that prioritize reliability.

### Quantitative Measures:
While the dissertation does not directly address generative AI, its interdisciplinary approach aligns with the grant's emphasis on innovative solutions. The relevance percentile for this dissertation could be estimated at around 60%, considering its indirect contributions to understanding complex systems and biases.
