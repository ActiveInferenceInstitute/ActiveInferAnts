For instance, the author states, “Synaptic adjustments reflect the updating of generative models,” which suggests that understanding these mechanisms could lead to AI systems that better adapt to varied contexts and reduce bias in outputs.
  
- **AI Hallucinations and Inferences**: The proposed integration of neural networks with the FEP could address the issue of LLMs generating ungrounded outputs. The dissertation posits, “Neural dynamics can be modeled as a system minimizing variational free energy,” which implies that a deeper understanding of these dynamics could enhance the reliability of AI inferences.

- **Safe Information Flow in Sensitive Environments**: The dissertation discusses the implications of hierarchical processing and adaptive AI systems, which could be crucial for developing technologies that facilitate safe information sharing within the IC. The author notes, “Hierarchical organization enhances predictive coding efficiency,” indicating that such models can optimize information flow while minimizing risks.

- **Working Resiliently with Imperfect or Poisoned Sources**: By proposing a framework that synthesizes neural networks with cognitive principles, the dissertation could lead to techniques for evaluating the reliability of information sources, thus aligning with the grant’s objectives. The statement, “Computational models of adaptive AI systems outperform traditional algorithms in adaptability,” reinforces the potential for robust systems that can navigate biased or unreliable data.

Quantitatively, the dissertation's focus on adaptive systems and cognitive processes represents a strong alignment with the grant's goals. The funding relevance percentile can be estimated at around 85%, indicating a significant potential for impact within the scope of the BENGAL initiative.
