# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and the literary themes presented in William Blake's art and poetry. The primary research questions focus on how Blake's themes can be modeled as neural networks, the dynamics of neural communication in understanding his artistic expression, and the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for cognitive science, literary studies, and education.

Overall, the dissertation presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach that, while innovative, does not directly align with the objectives of the IARPA BENGAL grant focused on understanding and mitigating biases in generative AI technologies. The primary mission of IARPA is to invest in high-risk, high-payoff research that enhances the safe adoption of generative AI within the Intelligence Community. Although the dissertation's exploration of cognitive processes may provide insights into creativity, it lacks a direct application to the biases and limitations associated with generative AI, as outlined in the grant's objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The IARPA BENGAL grant emphasizes the need for research focused on biases in generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs). The dissertation, however, is primarily concerned with literary analysis and cognitive science, making it less relevant to the specific focus areas of the grant.

- **Focus on Biases and AI Limitations:** The dissertation does not address the biases present in LLMs or propose methods for their mitigation. For instance, while the author discusses "thematic neurons" and "synaptic connections," there is no direct mention of how these concepts could be applied to understanding biases in AI outputs. This is a critical gap considering the grant's objective to develop technologies that can detect and mitigate biases.

- **Quantitative Measures:** The dissertation lacks quantitative measures or metrics that could evaluate biases in AI systems, which are essential for the BENGAL initiative. The research focuses on qualitative analysis of Blake's themes without providing empirical data that could be relevant to AI bias studies.

- **Potential Contributions:** While the dissertation contributes to the understanding of creativity and cognitive processes, it does not provide revolutionary improvements in generative AI capabilities, as required by the grant. The findings may enrich literary criticism but do not address the technical challenges outlined in the BENGAL program.

In summary, the dissertation's focus on literary and cognitive analysis does not align with the grant's emphasis on generative AI and its associated biases, leading to a relevance assessment of approximately 25% based on the grant's objectives.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive Perspective
- **Innovative Interdisciplinary Approach:** The dissertation presents a unique integration of neuroscience and literary analysis, which could inspire novel methodologies in other fields. For example, the concept of "thematic neurons" could lead to innovative ways of interpreting literature.

### Positive Perspective
- **Rich Theoretical Framework:** The use of neural network principles to analyze Blake's work provides depth to literary criticism. The author states, "By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work," which reflects a strong theoretical foundation.

### Neutral Perspective
- **Limited Practical Application:** While the dissertation is theoretically interesting, its practical applications are not clear. The lack of direct relevance to generative AI may limit its impact on the intended audience of the grant.

### Negative Perspective
- **Lack of Focus on AI Biases:** The dissertation fails to address the critical issues of biases in generative AI. The absence of discussions on how neural network concepts can mitigate biases in AI outputs is a significant oversight, given the grant's focus.

### Strongly Negative Perspective
- **Misalignment with Grant Objectives:** The dissertation does not align with the grant's criteria for revolutionary improvements in generative AI capabilities. The focus on Blakeâ€™s themes, while intellectually stimulating, is disconnected from the pressing issues of AI bias and limitations.

### Overall Rationale
The dissertation's innovative approach is commendable, but its lack of direct relevance to the grant's objectives significantly limits its potential for funding. The emphasis on literary analysis rather than on the technical challenges of generative AI biases is a critical shortcoming.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a noteworthy contribution to the fields of literary studies and cognitive science by proposing an interdisciplinary framework that connects neural networks with literary analysis. The exploration of Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements offers fresh insights into the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation.

- **Comparison with Grant Objectives:** The grant emphasizes the need for research that addresses biases in AI, while the dissertation focuses on enhancing understanding of literary themes. The quote, "This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism," highlights its innovative nature but does not intersect with the grant's focus on AI technologies.

- **Broader Impact:** The potential interdisciplinary applications in cognitive science and education are valuable; however, they do not align with the grant's mission to contribute to national security and intelligence technology. The dissertation's aim to foster a deeper understanding of cognitive processes in art does not address the urgent need for bias mitigation in AI technologies.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. However, the methodology lacks rigor in addressing the grant's requirements for empirical data related to AI biases.

- **Data Collection Methods:** The use of surveys to gauge reader engagement is valuable but does not provide the quantitative data necessary to evaluate biases in AI systems. The author states, "Reader responses will be gathered using structured surveys," but this approach is not applicable to the grant's focus on generative AI.

- **Analytical Techniques:** The neural network modeling presented in the dissertation is innovative but does not translate to practical applications for bias detection or mitigation in AI. The effectiveness of the proposed framework in addressing the grant's objectives remains unproven.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written, with clear organization and logical flow. The use of citations and references is appropriate, and figures illustrating the proposed theoretical framework enhance understanding.

- **Clarity and Organization:** The structure is coherent, with distinct chapters and sections that guide the reader through the research. The writing is accessible, making complex ideas understandable.

- **Use of Figures and Tables:** The inclusion of visual representations of thematic connections is effective, although these do not directly relate to the grant's focus on AI technologies.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the grant's objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Integrate AI Bias Research:** Incorporate a section that explicitly addresses biases in generative AI, potentially drawing parallels between Blake's themes and the biases in AI outputs. This could enhance the dissertation's relevance to the BENGAL initiative.

- **Quantitative Analysis of AI Technologies:** Utilize quantitative measures to evaluate biases in AI systems, perhaps through simulations or case studies that illustrate the application of neural network principles to AI bias detection.

- **Focus on Practical Applications:** Develop practical applications of the theoretical framework that could be tested in AI contexts, demonstrating the potential for innovative solutions to mitigate biases.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary exploration of neural networks and literary analysis, offering valuable insights into cognitive processes and artistic expression. However, its lack of direct relevance to the IARPA BENGAL grant's objectives significantly limits its alignment with the funding priorities. The recommendations provided could enhance the dissertation's impact and relevance, but as it stands, the work does not adequately address the pressing issues of biases in generative AI technologies. Therefore, the overall assessment of the dissertation's relevance to the grant is limited, with a potential for improvement through strategic revisions. 18.720356941223145
