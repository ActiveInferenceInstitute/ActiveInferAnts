## 1. Introduction

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and blockchain technology, focusing on how principles from chemistry can address challenges in decentralized systems. The research questions revolve around applying concepts such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics to enhance blockchain transaction validation, scalability, and efficiency. Overall, the work presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that could yield significant advancements in blockchain technology.

In the context of the Naval Information Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) grant objectives centered on biointelligence and biosecurity, the dissertation's relevance is limited. While the integration of chemical principles into blockchain technology is innovative, it does not directly address the evolving biological threats highlighted in the grant. The primary mission of our organization is to enhance the Intelligence Community's capabilities against biological threats, and this dissertation, while groundbreaking in its field, does not align with our objectives. 

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The grant's focus areas include biointelligence and biosecurity, emphasizing the need for technologies that improve the detection, analysis, and response to biological threats. The dissertation's exploration of blockchain technology does not directly contribute to these objectives. However, there are tangential points worth noting:

- **Interdisciplinary Innovation**: The dissertation proposes a "Shifted Domain," a conceptual space where chemical principles are applied to blockchain. While this is a novel approach, it does not address any specific biological threats or biosecurity measures. For instance, the research states, "The transformative potential of this Shifted Domain...contributes to a more efficient and sustainable blockchain ecosystem," which, while innovative, does not map onto the grant's focus areas.

- **Potential Applications**: The research discusses improving transaction throughput and scalability in blockchain systems. While these improvements could have applications in various industries, including healthcare, they do not specifically address the biological threats outlined in the grant. The dissertation states, "By enhancing transaction validation processes and scalability, businesses can achieve greater efficiency and security in their operations," which, while relevant to business efficiency, lacks direct implications for biointelligence or biosecurity.

Quantitatively, the alignment with the grant's objectives may be assessed at a low relevance percentile (approximately 20%), as the primary focus of the dissertation diverges from the core mission of enhancing capabilities against biological threats.
