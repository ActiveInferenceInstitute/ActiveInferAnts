# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the integration of neural network principles with guest experience management in the hospitality industry. The primary research questions focus on how neural network concepts can enhance the understanding of guest experiences, the implications for staff training and service delivery, and the utilization of guest data to create adaptive service models. Overall, the work aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances guest satisfaction and loyalty through innovative, data-driven strategies.

In the context of the Naval Information Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)'s grant objectives, the dissertation's relevance appears limited. While the grant emphasizes biointelligence and biosecurity, the dissertation focuses on hospitality management and neural networks, which do not directly align with the grant's mission of addressing biological threats. The overarching mission of IARPA is to enhance the Intelligence Community's capabilities against biological threats through advancements in synthetic biology and biotechnology. Consequently, the dissertation does not align with the grant's objectives, as it does not address biological threats or the application of biointelligence.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The dissertation lacks direct relevance to the grant's focus areas and objectives, which center on biointelligence and biosecurity. The research primarily investigates the application of neural network principles in hospitality, a field that does not intersect with the biological sciences. Specific examples from the dissertation, such as the development of a "Guest Experience Neural Model," aim to enhance guest satisfaction but do not contribute to the detection or analysis of biological threats, as outlined by the grant.

Quantitative measures further illustrate the lack of alignment. For instance, the grant's focus on advanced detection methods and biosecurity measures stands in stark contrast to the dissertation's emphasis on service delivery and guest experience. The funding relevance percentile for this dissertation, when evaluated against the grant's criteria, would likely fall below the 25th percentile, indicating minimal alignment with the grant's objectives.

Moreover, the dissertation does not address any technological advancements in synthetic biology or biosecurity measures, which are critical components of IARPA's mission. For example, while the grant seeks innovative methodologies for detecting biological materials, the dissertation focuses on enhancing service delivery in hospitality through data-driven strategies, which is outside the scope of the grant's interests.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a notable contribution to the field of hospitality management by proposing a framework that integrates neural network concepts into guest experience management. However, from the perspective of the grant's objectives, the contribution is limited. The grant emphasizes developing capabilities to counter biological threats, while the dissertation focuses on enhancing guest satisfaction through adaptive service delivery.

For instance, the dissertation states, "By leveraging neural network concepts, this research aims to provide a theoretical and practical framework for enhancing guest experiences through adaptive service delivery." This quote highlights the dissertation's focus on hospitality, which diverges from the grant's emphasis on biointelligence.

Comparatively, the grant summary states, "The BAA seeks to support research in two main areas: Biointelligence and Biosecurity." This juxtaposition underscores the disconnect between the dissertation’s contributions and the grant's objectives, as the research does not address the pressing needs of the Intelligence Community in countering biological threats.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to explore the integration of neural network concepts into guest experience management. While the methodology is appropriate for the research questions posed, it lacks alignment with the grant's requirements, which emphasize innovative technologies and methodologies related to biointelligence and biosecurity.

The data analysis techniques used in the dissertation, such as statistical methods for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data, are effective in addressing the research questions. However, these techniques do not pertain to the grant's focus areas. For example, the dissertation states, "Quantitative data will be analyzed using statistical methods to test hypotheses related to guest satisfaction and service delivery," which is unrelated to the detection or analysis of biological threats.

In summary, while the dissertation's methodology is rigorous and well-structured, it does not meet the grant's requirements for innovative research in biointelligence or biosecurity.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The overall quality of writing in the dissertation is commendable, with clear organization and logical flow. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables effectively support the research findings. However, the writing and structure do not align with the grant's standards, as the content is focused on hospitality management rather than biointelligence or biosecurity.

For instance, the dissertation’s executive summary states, "This research aims to merge these two domains by applying neural network principles to the guest experience in hospitality," which highlights its focus on hospitality rather than the biological sciences. Therefore, while the writing quality is high, its relevance to the grant is lacking.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the grant's objectives, the following actionable recommendations are suggested:

1. **Integrate Biosecurity Concepts**: Incorporate elements of biosecurity into the research framework to align with the grant's focus. For example, exploring how neural networks can contribute to detecting biological threats in hospitality settings could provide a novel angle.
   
2. **Conduct Comparative Studies**: Include case studies or comparative analyses that examine how data-driven approaches in hospitality can inform practices in biointelligence or biosecurity.

3. **Collaborate with Experts**: Engage with researchers in the fields of biointelligence and biosecurity to inform the research design and findings, ensuring alignment with grant objectives.

4. **Expand Literature Review**: Broaden the literature review to include studies related to biointelligence and biosecurity, establishing a clearer connection between the research and the grant's focus areas.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could enhance its alignment with the grant's objectives and increase its overall impact.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation presents a novel approach to enhancing guest experiences in hospitality through the application of neural network principles. However, its relevance to the grant's objectives of advancing biointelligence and biosecurity is minimal.
