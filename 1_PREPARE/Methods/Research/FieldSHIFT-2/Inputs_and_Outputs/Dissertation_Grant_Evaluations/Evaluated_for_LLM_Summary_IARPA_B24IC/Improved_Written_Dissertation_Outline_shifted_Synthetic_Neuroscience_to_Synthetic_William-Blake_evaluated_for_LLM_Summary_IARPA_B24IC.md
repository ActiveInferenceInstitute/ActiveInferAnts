# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and the literary themes of William Blake. The primary research questions focus on how Blake's themes can be modeled as neural networks, the dynamics of neural communication in understanding his artistic expression, and the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for cognitive science and literary studies. The overall impression of this work is that while it is innovative and rich in interdisciplinary exploration, it lacks direct relevance to the objectives outlined in the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Biointelligence and Biosecurity. 

The mission of the Naval Information Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (NIWC Pacific), in collaboration with IARPA, emphasizes the development of technologies and methodologies to enhance counter-biosecurity capabilities and address biological threats. The dissertation's focus on cognitive processes and literary analysis does not align with the grant's emphasis on biointelligence and biosecurity. Thus, while the work is academically valuable, it does not meet the specific objectives of the grant.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The BAA for Biointelligence and Biosecurity primarily seeks innovative research that can enhance the Intelligence Community's ability to detect and respond to biological threats. The dissertation, with its focus on neural networks and literary analysis, does not directly address these objectives. 

### Specific Examples of Misalignment
- **Biointelligence Focus**: The BAA emphasizes the development of detection instruments and methods for analyzing biological threats. The dissertation discusses cognitive processes related to artistic expression but does not provide any tools or methodologies that could be applied to biosecurity. For instance, the dissertation states, "By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work," which does not contribute to the detection or analysis of biological materials.
  
- **Biosecurity Objectives**: The BAA's focus on ensuring the security of biological research and technologies is not addressed in the dissertation. The research does not explore any security measures or methodologies that could be applied to biological data or infrastructure. 

### Quantitative Measures
In terms of relevance percentiles, the dissertation could be rated at a low relevance percentile (e.g., 10-20%) concerning the grant's objectives. The focus on literary analysis and cognitive science provides little to no direct application for the biological threats and security measures prioritized by the grant.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Strongly Positive Perspective
- **Interdisciplinary Innovation**: The dissertation introduces an innovative approach by integrating neural network principles with literary analysis. This perspective is commendable, as it opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research. For example, the introduction of "thematic neurons" is a novel concept that could inspire future research in cognitive science.

### Positive Perspective
- **Cognitive Engagement**: The focus on cognitive processes in artistic appreciation is valuable. The dissertation states, "By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, this dissertation offers fresh interpretations of his themes," which highlights the potential for cognitive insights in understanding literature.

### Neutral Perspective
- **Literary Value**: While the dissertation contributes to literary studies, its relevance to biointelligence and biosecurity is minimal. The work is well-structured and presents a thorough analysis of Blake's themes, but it does not align with the grant's objectives.

### Negative Perspective
- **Lack of Practical Application**: The dissertation does not provide practical applications or methodologies that could be utilized in biosecurity or biointelligence. The statement, "This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two traditionally distinct fields," lacks a connection to the practical needs of the grant.

### Strongly Negative Perspective
- **Irrelevance to Grant Objectives**: The overall focus on literary analysis without any connection to biological threats or intelligence capabilities makes the dissertation largely irrelevant to the grant. The work fails to address any of the key areas of interest outlined in the BAA.

### Final Perspective
- **Missed Opportunities**: The dissertation could have explored potential applications of cognitive science in understanding biological threats. A more interdisciplinary approach that connects literary themes to biosecurity challenges could have strengthened its relevance.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a notable contribution to the field of literary studies by integrating concepts from neuroscience. However, when viewed through the lens of the grant's objectives, its contribution appears limited. 

### Comparison with Grant's Focus Areas
- **Thematic Exploration**: The dissertation's exploration of Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements is a valuable contribution to literary criticism. However, the BAA emphasizes the need for methodologies that enhance the Intelligence Community's capabilities to counter biological threats. The dissertation states, "This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism," but fails to challenge the boundaries of biointelligence.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes
- **Dissertation Quote**: "This research aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work."
- **Grant Quote**: "The BAA seeks to support research in biointelligence and biosecurity to address the evolving biological threats."

The juxtaposition highlights the disconnect between the dissertation's objectives and those of the grant.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. However, this methodology does not align with the grant's requirements for research focused on biological threats.

### Evaluation of Methodology
- **Appropriateness**: While the mixed-methods approach is rigorous for literary analysis, it lacks the applicability needed for biosecurity research. The dissertation states, "This dual approach allows for a comprehensive exploration," but this exploration does not translate to the objectives of the grant.

### Data Analysis Techniques
- **Effectiveness**: The quantitative modeling of themes within a neural network framework is innovative but does not provide insights relevant to biological detection or analysis. The dissertation's focus on reader engagement lacks the quantitative measures necessary for assessing biological threats.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written and organized, demonstrating clarity in its arguments and structure. The use of citations is appropriate, and the figures and tables effectively illustrate key concepts.

### Quality of Writing
- **Clarity**: The writing is clear and accessible, making complex ideas understandable. The organization of chapters facilitates a logical flow of ideas.

### Use of Citations
- **Appropriateness**: The citations are relevant and support the arguments made throughout the dissertation. However, they do not align with the grant's focus on biointelligence and biosecurity.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the grant's objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:

### Specific Recommendations
1. **Integrate Biosecurity Concepts**: Consider incorporating themes related to biosecurity into the analysis of Blake's work. For example, exploring how Blake's themes could metaphorically represent biological threats could create a bridge between the two fields.

2. **Develop Practical Applications**: Identify practical applications of the cognitive insights gained from the research that could be relevant to biointelligence. For instance, exploring how cognitive engagement with literature could inform strategies for public health communication.

3. **Collaborate with Biosecurity Experts**: Engaging with experts in biosecurity could provide valuable insights that enhance the dissertation's relevance. This collaboration could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive processes relate to biological threats.

### Supporting Quotes from Grant Summary
