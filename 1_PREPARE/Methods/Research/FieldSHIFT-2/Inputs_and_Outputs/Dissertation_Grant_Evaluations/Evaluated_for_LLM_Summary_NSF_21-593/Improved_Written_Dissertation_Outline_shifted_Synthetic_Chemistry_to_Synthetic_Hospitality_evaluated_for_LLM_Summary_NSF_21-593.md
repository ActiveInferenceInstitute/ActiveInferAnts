The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the innovative intersection between the principles of chemistry and guest experience in the hospitality industry. The research questions focus on how chemical concepts such as transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms can enhance guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. Overall, this work presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that could significantly impact hospitality management practices.

In the context of the NSF 23-615 grant, which emphasizes advancing knowledge in physics and fostering interdisciplinary research, the relevance of this dissertation may not be immediately apparent. The grant primarily supports research within the field of physics, while this dissertation addresses hospitality management through the lens of chemical principles. The overall mission of the NSF is to advance the frontiers of knowledge and promote scientific innovation across disciplines. While the dissertation is innovative and well-structured, it does not align closely with the grant's objectives, which focus on physics-related research and applications.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The NSF 23-615 grant focuses on advancing knowledge in physics through investigator-initiated research projects. The key areas of interest include plasma physics, atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics, gravitational physics, and other areas directly related to physical sciences. Given this focus, the dissertation's exploration of chemical principles applied to hospitality does not align with the grant's core objectives.

### Specific Examples:
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: While the dissertation emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach, the integration of chemical principles into hospitality does not address any physics-related research questions or objectives outlined in the NSF grant. For instance, the dissertation states, "By framing guest experience through the lens of chemical principles, this dissertation seeks to provide actionable insights that can lead to improved operational efficiency." This focus on operational efficiency in hospitality does not contribute to advancing knowledge in physics.
  
- **Research Questions**: The overarching research questions posed in the dissertation—such as how chemical principles can enhance guest experience—do not resonate with the NSF's emphasis on advancing fundamental physics knowledge. The NSF grant encourages research that has the potential to contribute to scientific knowledge, whereas this dissertation focuses on a non-physical science domain.

### Quantitative Measures:
In terms of funding relevance percentiles, the dissertation's focus on hospitality management would likely fall below the threshold for funding under the NSF 23-615 grant, which prioritizes proposals that directly engage with physics research. The mismatch between the dissertation's objectives and the NSF's goals suggests a low alignment percentage, likely below 20%.
