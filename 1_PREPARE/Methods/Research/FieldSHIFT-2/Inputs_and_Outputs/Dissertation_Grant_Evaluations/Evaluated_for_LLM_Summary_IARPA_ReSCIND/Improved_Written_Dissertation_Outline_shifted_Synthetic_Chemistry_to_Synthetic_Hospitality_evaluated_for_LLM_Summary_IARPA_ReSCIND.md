# Dissertation Evaluation for ReSCIND Grant Relevance

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and guest experience in the hospitality industry. The research questions focus on how these principles can enhance guest satisfaction, identify key touchpoints in the guest journey, and develop a framework for operational efficiency. The overall impression of this work is that while it presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach to hospitality management, it does not align significantly with the objectives of the ReSCIND grant, which is primarily focused on cybersecurity and cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers.

The ReSCIND program aims to enhance cybersecurity by exploiting cognitive biases and decision-making processes of cyber attackers. In contrast, this dissertation is rooted in hospitality management and chemical principles, which, while innovative, do not directly address the grant's focus areas. The mission of the ReSCIND program is to develop defenses against cyber threats through understanding and manipulating attacker behavior, which is outside the scope of this dissertation. Therefore, the relevance of this dissertation to the ReSCIND grant is minimal.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The ReSCIND grant emphasizes the development of cybersecurity defenses that leverage cognitive vulnerabilities and behavioral changes within cyber attackers. The dissertation, however, primarily investigates the application of chemical principles to enhance guest experience in hospitality. 

### Assessment of Relevance
- **Focus Areas**: The ReSCIND grant's primary focus areas include cognitive vulnerabilities, behavioral changes in cyber attackers, and the development of cyberpsychology-informed defenses. The dissertation does not address any of these areas; rather, it delves into the optimization of guest experiences using principles from chemistry. 
- **Specific Examples**: For instance, the dissertation discusses "transformation" and "catalysis" in the context of guest interactions (e.g., "Mapping the guest journey involves identifying the various stages that guests experience..."). This focus on service delivery does not relate to the cognitive biases or decision-making processes of cyber attackers that the ReSCIND program seeks to manipulate.
- **Quantitative Measures**: The alignment with the grant's focus areas can be quantitatively assessed as low. The dissertation does not provide any metrics or findings that pertain to cybersecurity or cognitive vulnerabilities, which are essential for the ReSCIND objectives.

In summary, the dissertation's relevance to the ReSCIND grant is negligible, as it does not engage with the core themes of cybersecurity or cognitive psychology that are central to the grant's mission.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the field of hospitality management by proposing a novel framework that integrates chemical principles into guest experience design. This interdisciplinary approach opens avenues for research and practice in hospitality.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives
- **Dissertation Findings**: The dissertation posits that "implementing a transformation framework based on chemical principles will lead to a statistically significant increase in guest satisfaction scores."
- **Grant Focus**: The ReSCIND grant seeks to develop defenses that exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, focusing on behavioral changes in cyber attackers. There is no overlap between enhancing guest satisfaction in hospitality and manipulating attacker behavior in cybersecurity.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes
- **Dissertation**: "The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they offer practical applications for the hospitality industry."
- **Grant**: The ReSCIND program emphasizes the need for "innovative defenses that leverage the cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers."

In conclusion, while the dissertation makes a valuable contribution to hospitality management, it does not align with the ReSCIND program's objectives or contribute to the field of cybersecurity.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the intersection of chemical principles and guest experience.

### Evaluation of Methodology
- **Appropriateness**: The mixed-methods approach is suitable for the research questions posed. However, it lacks any connection to the methodologies required for cybersecurity research as outlined in the ReSCIND grant.
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The dissertation utilizes statistical analysis and thematic analysis. While effective for hospitality research, these techniques do not address the experimental protocols needed for the ReSCIND program.

### Limitations
- The dissertation does not engage with the ethical considerations or experimental protocols required for human subjects research, which are critical for the ReSCIND program's Phase 1 objectives.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written, with a clear structure and organization. Each chapter logically progresses from the introduction to the core findings.

### Quality of Writing
- **Clarity**: The writing is clear and accessible, making complex chemical concepts understandable within the hospitality context.
- **Citations**: The use of citations is appropriate, reflecting a thorough literature review. However, the references do not include any works related to cybersecurity or cognitive psychology.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the ReSCIND grant objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Incorporate Cybersecurity Themes**: Integrate discussions on cognitive vulnerabilities and decision-making processes into the framework.
   - *Example*: "Exploring how cognitive biases can influence guest behavior may provide insights applicable to cybersecurity."

2. **Develop Experimental Protocols**: Include a detailed experimental protocol that aligns with the ReSCIND program's Phase 1 requirements.
   - *Example*: "A comprehensive experimental design could assess how cognitive biases affect guest satisfaction and decision-making."

3. **Engage with Interdisciplinary Experts**: Collaborate with experts in cybersecurity and cognitive psychology to strengthen the research framework.
