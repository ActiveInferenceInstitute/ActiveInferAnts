# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the integration of neural network principles with guest experience management in the hospitality sector. The research questions focus on how neural network concepts can enhance the understanding of guest experiences, the implications for staff training, and the use of guest data for adaptive service models. The work aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances guest satisfaction and loyalty through data-driven strategies.

Overall, my impression of this dissertation is that it presents an innovative approach to guest experience management; however, it does not align closely with the objectives of the ReSCIND Program. The ReSCIND Program focuses on cybersecurity and the manipulation of attacker decision-making processes through cognitive vulnerabilities, while this dissertation is centered on hospitality and neural networks. The mission of our organization is to enhance cybersecurity by developing innovative defenses that exploit cognitive vulnerabilities, which does not intersect with the hospitality-focused research of this dissertation.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The ReSCIND Program emphasizes the identification of cognitive vulnerabilities and the development of defenses that can disrupt cyber attack behavior. While the dissertation explores cognitive principles, the application is strictly within the hospitality industry and does not address cybersecurity or the manipulation of attacker decision-making processes. 

### Key Misalignments:
- **Cognitive Vulnerabilities**: The dissertation does not identify or provide evidence of cognitive vulnerabilities that can be exploited in cyber contexts. For instance, while it discusses the application of neural networks to enhance guest experiences, it does not draw parallels to cognitive biases relevant to cyber attackers.
- **Behavioral Changes**: The focus is on enhancing guest satisfaction rather than inducing behavioral changes in cyber attackers. The research aims to create a "Guest Experience Neural Model," which does not contribute to understanding or disrupting cyber attack behavior.
- **Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses**: The dissertation does not propose any defenses or strategies that could be adapted for cybersecurity, which is a primary objective of the ReSCIND Program.

### Quantitative Measures:
- **Funding/Relevance Percentiles**: Given the lack of alignment with the ReSCIND Program's objectives, the dissertation could be rated at a low relevance percentile (below 25%) concerning the grantâ€™s focus areas.

### Examples from the Dissertation:
- The dissertation states, "By leveraging neural network concepts, this research aims to provide a theoretical and practical framework for enhancing guest experiences through adaptive service delivery." This aligns with hospitality but not with cybersecurity.
- The research questions, such as "How can neural network concepts enhance the understanding of guest experiences in hospitality?" do not address the cognitive vulnerabilities or decision-making processes relevant to the ReSCIND Program.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

### Perspective 5: Strongly Negative
- **Example**: The research lacks any discussion of cognitive vulnerabilities relevant to cybersecurity.
- **Rationale**: This viewpoint emphasizes the critical need for alignment with grant objectives, which the dissertation fails to achieve.

### Perspective 6: Completely Irrelevant
- **Example**: The dissertation's focus on hospitality is entirely outside the scope of the ReSCIND Program.
- **Rationale**: This perspective concludes that the dissertation does not provide any insights or contributions relevant to the field of cybersecurity.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes to the fields of hospitality management and neuroscience by proposing a new framework for understanding guest experiences. However, when viewed through the lens of the ReSCIND Program's objectives, the contribution is limited. 

### Comparison of Findings:
- **Quote from Dissertation**: "This research aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates neural network principles into hospitality practices."
- **Relevant Grant Objective**: The ReSCIND Program seeks to develop defenses that manipulate attacker decision-making processes.

While the dissertation emphasizes the importance of personalization and data-driven strategies in hospitality, it does not address the pressing need for innovative approaches in cybersecurity. The gap between the two fields highlights the need for research that directly contributes to the objectives of the ReSCIND Program.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, which is appropriate for exploring the complex interactions between neural networks and guest experiences. However, this methodological rigor does not align with the ReSCIND Program's requirements for experimental protocols in cybersecurity.

### Data Analysis Techniques:
- **Effectiveness**: The use of statistical methods for quantitative data analysis is commendable, but the lack of application to cybersecurity contexts limits its relevance.
- **Limitations**: The dissertation does not address potential biases in data interpretation or the applicability of findings to other fields, such as cybersecurity.

### Example:
- The dissertation mentions, "Quantitative data will be analyzed using statistical methods to test hypotheses related to guest satisfaction." This approach is valid for hospitality but does not provide insights relevant to the ReSCIND Program.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The quality of writing in the dissertation is high, with clear organization and a logical flow of ideas. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables effectively support the text. However, the focus remains on hospitality, which detracts from its alignment with the grant's standards and practices.

### Comments:
- The clarity of writing is commendable, making complex ideas accessible to the reader.
- The organization of chapters follows a logical structure, facilitating understanding, but the content lacks relevance to the grant objectives.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To improve the dissertation's alignment with the ReSCIND Program's objectives, the following actionable recommendations are proposed:

1. **Incorporate Cybersecurity Elements**: Integrate discussions on cognitive vulnerabilities relevant to cybersecurity to bridge the gap between hospitality and cybersecurity.
   - **Example Quote from Grant**: "The program will manipulate attacker decision-making processes to increase their operational costs."
   
2. **Explore Behavioral Changes in Cyber Contexts**: Investigate how neural network principles could be applied to understand and induce behavioral changes in cyber attackers.
   
3. **Develop Cyberpsychology-informed Models**: Create frameworks that could translate the findings from hospitality to cybersecurity, demonstrating the applicability of the research to the grant's objectives.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could enhance its relevance and contribute meaningfully to the fields of both hospitality and cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion

In summary, the dissertation presents a novel approach to guest experience management through the application of neural network principles. However, it lacks relevance to the objectives of the ReSCIND Program, which focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through the manipulation of cognitive vulnerabilities. 

### Strengths:
- Innovative interdisciplinary approach.
- Rigorous methodology and clear writing.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Lack of alignment with grant objectives.
- Absence of discussions on cognitive vulnerabilities and behavioral changes in cyber contexts.

Overall, while the dissertation contributes to the field of hospitality, its potential impact on the ReSCIND Program is minimal, and it would benefit from a stronger focus on cybersecurity-related themes. 29.57239294052124
