The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)" explores the integration of neural network principles with prediction matter expertise to develop an innovative framework for enhancing predictive capabilities across various disciplines. The central research questions focus on how neural networks can inform and improve PME, the emergence of new theoretical constructs from this integration, and the development of adaptive prediction models. Overall, this dissertation presents a compelling intersection of cognitive neuroscience and predictive analytics.

In the context of the ReSCIND grant, which aims to enhance cybersecurity by leveraging the cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers, this dissertation demonstrates moderate relevance. While the dissertation does not directly address cybersecurity, its exploration of cognitive biases, decision-making processes, and adaptive systems aligns with the grant's objectives of understanding and inducing behavioral changes in cyber attackers. The mission of the ReSCIND program is to manipulate attacker decision-making processes, which resonates with the dissertation's focus on improving decision-making through predictive modeling. However, the direct application to cybersecurity remains limited, suggesting that while the dissertation is relevant, it may require further alignment to fully meet the grant objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The ReSCIND grant focuses on five key technical challenges, including the identification of cognitive vulnerabilities, understanding behavioral changes, and developing cyberpsychology-informed defenses. The dissertation's exploration of cognitive biases and decision-making processes can contribute valuable insights to these areas.

### Cognitive Vulnerabilities

The dissertation discusses cognitive biases, stating, "Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, which can significantly impact decision-making in PME." This aligns with the ReSCIND objective of identifying cognitive vulnerabilities (CogVulns) that can be exploited to disrupt cyber attackers. By understanding these biases, researchers can develop strategies to manipulate attacker decision-making processes, thereby increasing operational costs and reducing effectiveness.

### Behavioral Changes

One of the grant's objectives is to measure and induce changes in cyber attack behavior. The dissertation proposes adaptive prediction models that "enhance the adaptability and accuracy of predictive models." This adaptability can be crucial in developing defenses that disrupt cyber attack behavior. The dissertation emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and adaptation, which can inform the development of cyberpsychology-informed defenses (CyphiDs) that adjust in real-time based on attacker behavior.

### Quantitative Measures

Quantitatively, the dissertationâ€™s exploration of cognitive biases and decision-making processes can be evaluated in the context of the ReSCIND program's funding and relevance percentiles. The integration of neural networks with PME provides a novel approach to understanding behaviors that could be applied to the cybersecurity domain, although the direct applicability remains to be fully explored.
