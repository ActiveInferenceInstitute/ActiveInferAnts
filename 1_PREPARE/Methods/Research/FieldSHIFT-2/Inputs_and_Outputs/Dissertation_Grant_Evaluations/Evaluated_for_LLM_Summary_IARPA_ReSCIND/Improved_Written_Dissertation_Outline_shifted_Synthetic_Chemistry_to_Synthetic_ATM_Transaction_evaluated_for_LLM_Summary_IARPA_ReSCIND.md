# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation for ReSCIND Grant Relevance

## 1. Introduction

- **Dissertation Summary**: The dissertation titled "The Shifted Domain: Fusing Chemical Reaction Principles with ATM Transaction Processes" explores the innovative integration of chemical principles with automated teller machine (ATM) transaction processes. It poses research questions centered on enhancing ATM functionalities, improving user experiences, and optimizing transaction flows through concepts borrowed from chemistry, such as catalysis and equilibrium.

- **Overall Impression**: While the dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach, its relevance to the ReSCIND grant objectives appears limited. The ReSCIND program focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through cyberpsychology and cognitive vulnerabilities, whereas this dissertation primarily addresses financial technology and user interface design without a direct link to cybersecurity.

- **Organizational Mission**: The ReSCIND program aims to develop innovative defenses against cyber threats by leveraging cognitive vulnerabilities of attackers. The primary focus is on manipulating attacker behavior and decision-making processes. Given this mission, the dissertation does not align well with the program's objectives, as it does not address cybersecurity nor the cognitive aspects of attacker behavior.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**: The dissertationâ€™s focus on optimizing ATM transaction processes through principles of chemical reactions does not align with the ReSCIND grant's emphasis on cybersecurity and cognitive vulnerabilities. For instance, the research questions such as "How can principles of chemical catalysis be applied to enhance ATM user interfaces?" and "What methods can be employed to maintain transaction equilibrium in high-traffic ATM locations?" do not address the core technical challenges outlined in the ReSCIND program.

- **Specific Examples**: The dissertation discusses concepts such as "transaction catalysis" and "transaction equilibrium," which are relevant to enhancing user experience in financial technology but do not provide insights into cognitive vulnerabilities or behavioral changes in cyber attackers. For example, the statement, "This model allows for the exploration of user interactions as dynamic processes influenced by various factors," while insightful for ATM functionality, lacks relevance to the cognitive manipulation of cyber attackers.

- **Quantitative Measures**: The dissertation does not provide quantitative measures that relate to the ReSCIND program. In contrast, the grant emphasizes the need for evidence-based research on cognitive vulnerabilities, which is absent in this work. As such, the alignment percentage could be estimated at less than 10%, given the disparity in focus areas.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

1. **Strongly Positive**: The interdisciplinary approach to combining chemical principles with ATM transactions is innovative and could inspire new methodologies in user interface design.
   - *Quote*: "This research is significant because it bridges two traditionally distinct fields."
   - *Rationale*: Encourages exploration of novel ideas but lacks direct relevance to cybersecurity.

2. **Positive**: The application of chemical principles to enhance transaction efficiency may have indirect implications for secure transaction processes.
   - *Quote*: "By applying chemical principles to financial transactions, this dissertation will challenge existing paradigms."
   - *Rationale*: While innovative, it does not address the cognitive vulnerabilities targeted by the ReSCIND program.

3. **Neutral**: The research methodology is sound, but the focus on financial technology does not align with the grant's objectives.
   - *Quote*: "Data collection involves surveys and interviews with ATM users and operators."
   - *Rationale*: Methodological rigor is commendable but does not pertain to cybersecurity challenges.

4. **Negative**: The lack of focus on cybersecurity and cognitive vulnerabilities significantly detracts from the dissertation's relevance to the grant.
   - *Quote*: "This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation in user interface design."
   - *Rationale*: Innovations in UI design do not address the core objectives of the ReSCIND program.

5. **Strongly Negative**: The dissertation fails to engage with the ReSCIND program's emphasis on behavioral changes in cyber attackers.
   - *Quote*: "The implications of this research extend beyond ATM systems."
   - *Rationale*: The focus on ATMs does not connect to the behavioral aspects of cyber threats.

6. **Very Strongly Negative**: The dissertation does not address any of the technical challenges outlined in the ReSCIND program.
   - *Quote*: "The concept of 'transaction catalysis' emerges as a means to enhance user interactions."
   - *Rationale*: There is no connection to cognitive vulnerabilities or adaptive defenses, critical to the grant's mission.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

- **Overall Contribution**: The dissertation contributes to the fields of financial technology and user experience design but does not advance knowledge in cybersecurity or cognitive psychology, which are the primary focus areas of the ReSCIND grant.

- **Comparison with Grant Objectives**: The ReSCIND program seeks to manipulate attacker behavior, while the dissertation emphasizes enhancing ATM functionalities. For example, the dissertation states, "The framework introduced... opens avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration," which, while valuable, does not contribute to the ReSCIND's goal of developing cybersecurity defenses.

- **Juxtaposition of Quotes**: The grant summary emphasizes "developing innovative defenses that leverage cognitive vulnerabilities," contrasting sharply with the dissertation's focus on "enhancing ATM functionalities." This highlights a fundamental disconnect between the two.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

- **Evaluation of Methodology**: The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, which is appropriate for exploring user interactions and transaction processes. However, this methodology does not align with the ReSCIND program's requirements for experimental protocols focused on cognitive vulnerabilities.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The dissertation utilizes statistical analysis of transaction times and user satisfaction metrics, which is effective for its objectives but lacks relevance to the cognitive aspects emphasized in the ReSCIND program.

- **Examples**: The dissertation mentions, "Statistical analysis of transaction times and user satisfaction metrics will be conducted," showcasing a rigorous approach but not addressing the behavioral changes in cyber attackers required by the grant.

## 6. Writing and Structure

- **Quality of Writing**: The dissertation is well-written, with a clear structure and logical flow. The use of tables and figures enhances clarity, but the content does not align with the grant's focus.

- **Citations and Figures**: The dissertation effectively uses citations to support its claims; however, the lack of relevant literature on cybersecurity and cognitive psychology diminishes its alignment with the ReSCIND program's standards.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  1. **Integrate Cybersecurity Elements**: Incorporate discussions on how the principles of chemical reactions could inform cybersecurity measures or user behavior in the context of cyber threats.
  2. **Address Cognitive Vulnerabilities**: Explore how cognitive biases may affect user interactions with ATM systems and how these could be leveraged to enhance security.
  3. **Collaborate with Cybersecurity Experts**: Engage with professionals in cybersecurity to develop a framework that merges financial technology with cybersecurity insights.

- **Supporting Quotes**: The grant summary states, "Proposals must address all technical challenges," indicating the need for alignment with the program's objectives.

## 8. Conclusion

- **Summary of Evaluation**: The dissertation presents an innovative approach to combining chemical principles with ATM transaction processes, but it lacks relevance to the ReSCIND grant's focus on cybersecurity and cognitive vulnerabilities.

- **Final Assessment**: Overall, the dissertation's alignment with the ReSCIND program is minimal, with potential improvements needed to connect its findings to the grant's objectives. Without significant adjustments, the dissertation will not meet the criteria for funding under the ReSCIND program. 19.28568172454834
