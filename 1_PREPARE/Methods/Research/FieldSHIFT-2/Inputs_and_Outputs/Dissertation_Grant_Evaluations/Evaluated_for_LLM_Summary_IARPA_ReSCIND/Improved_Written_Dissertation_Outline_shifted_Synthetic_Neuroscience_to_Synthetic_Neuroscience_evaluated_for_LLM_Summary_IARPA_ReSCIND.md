# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation Relevance to the ReSCIND Grant

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks" explores the integration of biological principles into artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance their efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability. The central research questions address how biological learning mechanisms, such as synaptic plasticity, neuron diversity, and glial support, can be effectively transposed into computational frameworks to improve ANN performance. The significance of this work lies in its potential to bridge neuroscience and artificial intelligence, which could have implications across various fields including cybersecurity.

Overall, while the dissertation presents innovative approaches to improving ANNs, its direct relevance to the ReSCIND grant's objectives appears limited. The ReSCIND program focuses specifically on leveraging cognitive vulnerabilities in cyber attackers to enhance cybersecurity measures, primarily through behavioral changes and cognitive modeling. Although the dissertation addresses concepts of adaptability and learning, it does not explicitly pertain to the cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers or the development of cyberpsychology-informed defenses. The mission of the ReSCIND program is to manipulate attacker decision-making processes, which is not a primary focus of this dissertation.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The ReSCIND grant emphasizes five technical challenges aimed at enhancing cybersecurity through cognitive psychology principles. These include identifying cognitive vulnerabilities, understanding behavioral changes, developing cyberpsychology-informed defenses, creating computational cognitive models, and producing adaptive defenses. 

### Assessment of Relevance

1. **Identification of Cognitive Vulnerabilities**: The dissertation does not specifically address cognitive vulnerabilities of cyber attackers. While it explores synaptic plasticity and learning mechanisms, it does not provide evidence or frameworks relevant to cognitive biases in cyber contexts.

2. **Understanding and Inducing Behavioral Changes**: The research discusses adaptability in ANNs but lacks a focus on behavioral changes in cyber attackers. The dissertation's emphasis on improving ANN performance does not translate to understanding or influencing attacker behavior.

3. **Development of Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses**: The dissertation proposes biologically inspired algorithms for ANNs but does not develop or test defenses against cyber attacks, which is a core objective of the ReSCIND grant.

4. **Creation of Cyber-specific Computational Cognitive Models**: The work introduces new constructs like Neuroplasticity Algorithms, yet these do not directly correlate with creating models that predict or disrupt cyber attacker behavior.

5. **Production of Adaptive Psychology-informed Defenses**: While adaptive learning is a theme in the dissertation, it does not connect to real-time observations of attacker behavior, a key requirement of the ReSCIND program.

### Quantitative Measures

In terms of alignment with the grant's objectives, the dissertation may fall into a lower relevance percentile. Given the specific focus of the ReSCIND program, it might be rated around the 30th percentile for relevance, as it does not address the core themes of cognitive vulnerabilities and cybersecurity defenses.
