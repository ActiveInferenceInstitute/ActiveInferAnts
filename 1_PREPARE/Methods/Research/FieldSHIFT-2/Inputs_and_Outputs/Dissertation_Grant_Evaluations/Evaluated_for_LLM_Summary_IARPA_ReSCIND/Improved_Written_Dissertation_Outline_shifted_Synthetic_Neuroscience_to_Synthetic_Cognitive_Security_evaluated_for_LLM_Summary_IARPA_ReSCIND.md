The mission of the ReSCIND program is to enhance cybersecurity by manipulating attacker decision-making processes, which resonates with the dissertation's focus on cognitive resilience and bias mitigation. While the dissertation does not directly address cybersecurity in the conventional sense, it provides theoretical constructs and methodologies that could inform the development of innovative defenses against cognitive threats, thus contributing to the overarching goals of the ReSCIND program.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The ReSCIND grant emphasizes the importance of understanding cognitive vulnerabilities and developing defenses that exploit these weaknesses. The dissertation's exploration of cognitive resilience and bias mitigation is directly relevant to the grant's objectives. For instance, the dissertation introduces the concept of "Cognitive Resilience Engineering," which emphasizes proactive measures to enhance cognitive security. This aligns with the grant's focus on the identification of Cognitive Vulnerabilities (CogVulns) and the development of Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs).

Specific examples from the dissertation that illustrate this alignment include:

- **Cognitive Vulnerabilities**: The dissertation highlights the need to understand cognitive biases that can be exploited by attackers, stating, "the cognitive dimensions of security remain underexplored." This echoes the grant's objective of identifying and providing evidence of CogVulns.
