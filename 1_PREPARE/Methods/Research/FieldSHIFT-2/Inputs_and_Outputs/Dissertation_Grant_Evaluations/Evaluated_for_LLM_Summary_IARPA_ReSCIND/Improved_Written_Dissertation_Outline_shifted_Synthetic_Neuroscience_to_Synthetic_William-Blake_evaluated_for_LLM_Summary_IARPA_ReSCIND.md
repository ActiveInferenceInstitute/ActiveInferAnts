# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation for ReSCIND Grant Relevance

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and the literary contributions of William Blake. The primary research questions focus on modeling Blake's themes as neural networks, understanding cognitive dynamics in his artistic expression, and the interdisciplinary implications for neuroscience and literary studies. 

Overall, the dissertation presents an innovative approach that merges cognitive science with literary analysis, but it does not align closely with the objectives of the ReSCIND grant. The ReSCIND program aims to enhance cybersecurity through an understanding of cognitive vulnerabilities in cyber attackers, while this dissertation is rooted in the humanities and does not address cybersecurity or cognitive vulnerabilities relevant to cyber threats.

The mission of the ReSCIND program is to develop defenses that manipulate attacker decision-making processes and exploit cognitive biases. As such, while the dissertation demonstrates intellectual rigor and creativity, it lacks direct relevance to the grant's objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The ReSCIND grant focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through cognitive psychology, specifically by identifying cognitive vulnerabilities and inducing changes in cyber attack behavior. The dissertation's exploration of neural networks and cognitive processes in artistic expression does not directly address the technical challenges outlined in the grant, particularly:

1. **Identification of Cognitive Vulnerabilities (CogVulns)**: The dissertation does not identify or provide evidence of cognitive biases that could be exploited in the context of cyber attacks. For instance, while it discusses cognitive resonance in the context of art appreciation, it does not translate those insights into a framework applicable to cybersecurity.

2. **Understanding and Inducing Behavioral Changes**: The research does not focus on measuring or inducing changes in behavior related to cyber attacks. The findings are centered on literary engagement rather than behavioral modification in a cybersecurity context.

3. **Development of Cyberpsychology-informed Defenses (CyphiDs)**: The dissertation does not propose any defenses against cyber attacks, which is a core objective of the ReSCIND program.

4. **Creation of Cyber-specific Computational Cognitive Models (C3Ms)**: The dissertation lacks any computational modeling relevant to predicting or altering cyber attacker behavior.

5. **Production of Adaptive Psychology-informed Defenses (APhiDs)**: There is no discussion of developing systems that automate the selection of defenses based on real-time observations of behavior, which is integral to the grant's objectives.

In quantitative terms, the dissertation may fall within a low relevance percentile (e.g., <20%) for the ReSCIND grant, given its focus on literary analysis rather than the practical applications in cybersecurity that the grant seeks.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
1. **Strongly Positive**: The dissertation demonstrates a high level of intellectual creativity and interdisciplinary engagement. For example, the author states, "By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work." This innovative approach is commendable but does not align with the grant's focus.

2. **Positive**: The theoretical framework is robust and well-articulated, particularly in its exploration of synaptic plasticity and cognitive resonance. However, this strength does not translate to the cybersecurity domain, as noted in the quote, "The thematic neurons represent central themes in Blake's work." This insight is valuable in literary studies but lacks application in cyberpsychology.

3. **Neutral**: While the mixed-methods approach is appropriate for literary analysis, it does not meet the methodological rigor required for the ReSCIND program’s experimental protocols. The research design lacks a focus on ethical considerations relevant to human subjects in a cybersecurity context.

4. **Negative**: The lack of practical applications for cybersecurity is evident. The dissertation states, "This research aims to uncover deeper insights into Blake's artistic vision," which, while insightful, does not contribute to the objectives of enhancing cybersecurity.

5. **Strongly Negative**: The absence of any discussion on cognitive vulnerabilities relevant to cyber attackers is a significant gap. The dissertation fails to address the core mission of the ReSCIND program, which is to manipulate attacker decision-making processes.

6. **Critically Negative**: Ultimately, the dissertation does not fulfill the grant's requirements. The author’s focus on artistic and cognitive dimensions, while enriching in its own right, diverts from the pressing need for innovative cybersecurity solutions. The assertion that "this research can contribute to a more informed and appreciative society" is admirable but misaligned with the grant’s objectives.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation makes a substantial contribution to the fields of literary studies and cognitive science by proposing a novel theoretical framework that connects neural networks to artistic expression. It challenges traditional boundaries and encourages interdisciplinary discourse. For instance, the author asserts, "This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism," which is a valuable perspective.

However, when viewed through the lens of the ReSCIND program's objectives, the contributions are limited. The grant emphasizes the need for innovative defenses against cyber threats, whereas the dissertation focuses on understanding creativity and artistic engagement. The findings on cognitive processes in artistic creation do not translate into actionable insights for cybersecurity.

In contrast, the grant summary states, "The program seeks to create a robust set of tools and methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of cyber defenses." The dissertation's lack of alignment with this goal indicates a missed opportunity for practical application in the field of cybersecurity.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis
The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. While this methodology is appropriate for exploring themes in literature, it does not meet the rigorous experimental protocols required by the ReSCIND program.

The data collection methods, including surveys and interviews to gather reader responses, are well-designed for literary analysis but lack the focus on cognitive vulnerabilities critical to the grant. The author notes, "Reader responses will be gathered using structured surveys designed to capture emotional and cognitive engagement," but this does not address the technical challenges outlined in the grant.

Furthermore, the dissertation does not employ data analysis techniques relevant to cybersecurity, limiting its applicability to the grant's objectives. The lack of discussion around ethical considerations specific to human subjects in cybersecurity research is also a notable limitation.

## 6. Writing and Structure
The dissertation is well-written, with clear organization and a logical flow of ideas. The use of citations is appropriate, and figures and tables effectively illustrate key concepts. For instance, the visual representation of thematic neurons and synaptic connections is a strong element of the dissertation.

However, the writing does not reflect the standards expected for a proposal aligned with the ReSCIND program. The focus on literary analysis and cognitive engagement detracts from the clarity needed to address cybersecurity challenges. The author states, "This innovative approach not only enriches our interpretation of Blake's poetry," but this focus does not meet the grant's requirements for addressing technical challenges.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the ReSCIND grant, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Focus on Cyberpsychology**: Integrate concepts from cyberpsychology to explore cognitive vulnerabilities in cyber attackers, aligning the research with the grant's objectives.

2. **Develop Practical Applications**: Propose specific applications of the theoretical framework to cybersecurity, such as developing cognitive models that predict attacker behavior based on identified vulnerabilities.

3. **Incorporate Experimental Protocols**: Design experimental protocols that adhere to the ethical guidelines outlined in the grant, ensuring that the research can be applied to human subjects in a cybersecurity context.

4. **Address Technical Challenges**: Directly engage with the technical challenges outlined in the grant, such as the development of cyberpsychology-informed defenses and adaptive systems.

By implementing these recommendations, the dissertation could significantly enhance its alignment with the ReSCIND program's objectives and contribute to the field of cybersecurity.

## 8. Conclusion
In summary, the dissertation presents a creative and intellectually rigorous exploration of the intersection between neural networks and William Blake's work. However, it lacks direct relevance to the objectives of the ReSCIND grant, which focuses on enhancing cybersecurity through an understanding of cognitive vulnerabilities in cyber attackers.

The strengths of the dissertation lie in its interdisciplinary approach and theoretical contributions to literary studies, but these do not translate into actionable insights for the cybersecurity domain. Therefore, while the work is commendable within its own field, it does not align with the mission of the ReSCIND program, and significant improvements are needed to enhance its relevance and impact in the context of cybersecurity. 23.956012964248657
