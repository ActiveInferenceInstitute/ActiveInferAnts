# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality" explores the innovative intersection between the principles of chemistry and the guest experience in the hospitality industry. The central research questions focus on how chemical reaction principles can enhance guest satisfaction, identify key touchpoints in the guest journey, and develop a framework for measurable improvements in operational efficiency. 

Overall, the work presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that aligns with the objectives of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). The GRFP aims to support outstanding graduate students in STEM fields, emphasizing the importance of intellectual merit and broader societal impacts. The dissertation demonstrates significant research potential that could contribute to advancing knowledge in both hospitality management and chemical sciences, thus aligning well with the NSF's mission to enhance the U.S. scientific workforce.

The NSF GRFP seeks to recruit individuals who can contribute significantly to STEM fields, particularly from underrepresented and underserved communities. While the dissertation primarily focuses on hospitality, its interdisciplinary nature and innovative application of scientific principles offer a unique contribution to the broader STEM landscape. Therefore, I assess the dissertation as relevant to the grant, with opportunities for enhancing its alignment with the NSF's objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The NSF GRFP emphasizes two primary evaluation criteria: intellectual merit and broader impacts. This dissertation aligns with both criteria, providing a strong foundation for its relevance to the grant's focus areas.

### Intellectual Merit
The dissertation introduces a transformative framework that applies chemical principles to hospitality management. For example, the author states, "By framing guest experience through the lens of chemical principles, this dissertation seeks to provide actionable insights that can lead to improved operational efficiency, enhanced service quality, and ultimately, increased profitability for hospitality enterprises." This statement reflects a clear intellectual contribution that advances knowledge in both chemistry and hospitality.

Moreover, the dissertation's mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies, adds rigor to the research. The proposed hypotheses, such as "Implementing a transformation framework based on chemical principles will lead to a statistically significant increase in guest satisfaction scores," demonstrate a commitment to empirical validation, which is a key aspect of the NSF's focus on advancing knowledge.

### Broader Impacts
The dissertation's focus on enhancing guest experiences through scientific principles has the potential for significant societal benefits. The integration of chemical principles into hospitality management can lead to improved service delivery, increased guest satisfaction, and enhanced operational efficiency. The author notes that "the implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they offer practical applications for the hospitality industry." This aligns with the NSF's goal of supporting research that benefits society and contributes to desired societal outcomes.

Furthermore, the dissertation emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in the hospitality workforce. By addressing barriers to inclusion and recognizing the unique experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds, the research aligns with the NSF's mission to broaden participation in STEM fields.

### Quantitative Measures
While the dissertation does not provide explicit quantitative measures of its relevance to the NSF GRFP, the interdisciplinary nature of the research and its potential for practical applications in hospitality suggest a strong alignment. The integration of scientific principles into a traditionally qualitative field such as hospitality can enhance the relevance of both disciplines, contributing to the NSF's objectives of fostering a diverse and capable STEM workforce.
