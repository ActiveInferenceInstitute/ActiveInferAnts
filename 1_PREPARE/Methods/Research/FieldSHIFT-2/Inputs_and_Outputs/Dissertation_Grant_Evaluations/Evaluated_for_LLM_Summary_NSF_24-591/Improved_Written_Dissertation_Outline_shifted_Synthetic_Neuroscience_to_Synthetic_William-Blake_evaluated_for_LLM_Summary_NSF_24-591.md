# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the innovative intersection of neural networks and the literary analysis of William Blake's themes. The central research questions focus on modeling Blake's themes as neural networks, understanding the dynamics of neural communication in relation to his artistic expression, and examining the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for cognitive science, literary studies, and education. 

Overall, this work presents a novel theoretical framework that not only reinterprets Blake's themes but also attempts to bridge the gap between neuroscience and literature. In the context of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP), which aims to enhance the quality and diversity of the U.S. scientific and engineering workforce, this dissertation aligns well with the program's objectives of supporting outstanding graduate students in STEM fields. Although the dissertation primarily focuses on literary analysis, the application of neural network principles to cognitive science and education demonstrates its potential broader impacts, particularly in fostering interdisciplinary research and enhancing educational methodologies.

The NSF GRFP's mission emphasizes the importance of intellectual merit and broader impacts, both of which are addressed in this dissertation. However, the relevance may be somewhat limited for traditional STEM fields, as the primary focus is on literary studies rather than a direct scientific inquiry. Nevertheless, the interdisciplinary approach offers fresh perspectives that could contribute to the broader discourse on cognitive processes in artistic engagement.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The dissertation's relevance to the NSF GRFP can be assessed through its alignment with the program's focus areas and objectives. The GRFP emphasizes supporting research that advances knowledge within STEM fields and contributes to broader societal outcomes.

### Neutral Perspective
- **Limited Direct STEM Focus**: While the interdisciplinary nature is valuable, the reviewer expresses concern about the limited applicability to traditional STEM fields. "The primary focus on literary studies may not fully resonate with the core objectives of the GRFP," they note.

### Negative Perspective
- **Need for Empirical Data**: The reviewer highlights the absence of empirical data to support claims. "While the theoretical framework is compelling, the lack of quantitative measures limits the ability to evaluate its effectiveness in cognitive science applications."

### Strongly Negative Perspective
- **Potential Misalignment with Grant Objectives**: The reviewer is concerned that the dissertation may not align closely enough with the GRFP's primary goals. "The focus on literature rather than a scientific inquiry may detract from its relevance to the fellowship's objectives," they conclude.

### Overall Rationale
The feedback spans a range of perspectives, reflecting the dissertation's innovative approach while acknowledging its limitations in directly addressing the GRFP's core objectives. The interdisciplinary nature is seen as a strength, but the focus on literary studies raises questions about its relevance in traditional STEM contexts.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a notable contribution to both literary studies and cognitive science, particularly by proposing a framework that integrates neural networks with literary analysis. The author states, "The intersection of neuroscience and literature presents significant opportunities for new insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic engagement." This assertion aligns with the GRFP's objective of advancing knowledge within STEM fields.

### Comparison with Grant Focus Areas
- **Cognitive Processes**: The dissertation's exploration of cognitive processes in artistic engagement is a valuable addition to the discourse on how literature can be understood through scientific principles. The author notes, "By examining Blake's work through the lens of neural networks, this dissertation aims to uncover the underlying cognitive processes that inform artistic creation and appreciation." This aligns with the GRFP's emphasis on intellectual merit.

- **Educational Implications**: The potential for practical applications in education is significant. The author states, "By integrating insights from neuroscience into educational curricula, educators can develop innovative approaches to teaching literature and art." This aligns with the GRFP's broader impacts goal, as it promotes diversity and inclusion in educational settings.
