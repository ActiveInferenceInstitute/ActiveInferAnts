# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions

## I. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions" explores the innovative intersection of neural networks and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. It seeks to develop adaptive ATM systems that learn from user interactions to enhance user experience, optimize transaction flows, and improve security measures. The overarching research questions focus on integrating neural network principles into ATM systems, assessing the implications of adaptive interfaces on user satisfaction, and utilizing predictive algorithms for cash management.

Overall, my impression of this work is mixed in the context of the Future of Life Institute (FLI) grant objectives. While the dissertation offers a unique approach to enhancing banking technology, it does not directly address the pressing issue of AI-driven power concentration as outlined in the grant summary. The FLI's mission is to mitigate the risks associated with AI's potential to centralize power, emphasizing equitable distribution of resources and human agency. The dissertation's focus on ATM technology, while innovative, appears tangential to these objectives.

**Top-line Summary**: The dissertation is not directly relevant to FLI's grant objectives, as it primarily addresses technological advancements in banking rather than the broader societal implications of AI power concentration.

## II. Relevance to Grant

The FLI grant program focuses on projects that counter AI-driven power concentration and promote equitable power distribution. The dissertation's focus on enhancing ATM technology through neural networks does not align closely with these goals. However, some aspects of the research could be indirectly relevant:

- **Adaptive Systems**: The dissertation proposes adaptive ATM systems that learn from user interactions. While this could improve user experience, it does not tackle the systemic issues of power concentration in AI technologies. For instance, the dissertation states, "the potential for adaptive ATMs to learn from user interactions offers a transformative solution," but it does not connect this transformation to broader societal implications of AI.

- **User-Centric Design**: The emphasis on user experience and satisfaction in banking technology could be seen as a small step toward empowering individuals. However, the grant's focus on countering corporate monopolies and ensuring public control over AI technologies is not addressed. The dissertation mentions, "the design of adaptive ATM interfaces will be grounded in principles of user-centered design," yet lacks a discussion on how this could influence the power dynamics in the banking sector.

- **Predictive Algorithms**: The use of predictive algorithms for cash management could optimize operational efficiency. However, this aspect does not directly relate to the grant's objectives of redistributing power and resources in the context of AI. The dissertation states, "statistical analysis will be employed to evaluate the impact of adaptive interfaces on transaction efficiency," but fails to connect these improvements to societal benefits.

Quantitatively, the dissertation may fall within a lower relevance percentile for the grant's focus areas, as it primarily addresses a niche technological advancement rather than systemic societal challenges posed by AI.

## III. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

The statement, "the implications for banks and financial institutions in adopting adaptive ATM technologies are profound," could benefit from a deeper exploration of societal impacts.

### Negative
- **Lack of Societal Focus**: The dissertation does not adequately address the societal implications of AI-driven power concentration. The absence of discussions on how adaptive ATM systems could influence power dynamics in the banking sector is a significant oversight.

### Strongly Negative
- **Misalignment with Grant Objectives**: The dissertation's focus on banking technology does not align with the grant's objectives of mitigating AI-driven power concentration. The conclusion states, "this research seeks to address these gaps," but fails to connect these gaps to the grant's overarching mission.

### Overall Rationale
The dissertation demonstrates innovation and interdisciplinary exploration but ultimately lacks alignment with the FLI grant's objectives. The focus on ATM technology, while significant in its own right, does not address the pressing societal challenges posed by AI.

## IV. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes to the field of banking technology by proposing a framework for integrating neural network principles into ATM transactions. The emphasis on adaptive systems and user experience design is noteworthy. However, when viewed through the lens of the FLI grant's objectives, the contribution appears limited.

- **Comparison with Grant Focus Areas**: The grant emphasizes innovative solutions to counter AI-driven power concentration. In contrast, the dissertation primarily focuses on technological advancements in a specific domain. For example, the dissertation states, "the potential for adaptive ATMs to learn from user interactions offers a transformative solution," yet this transformation does not address the broader societal implications of AI.

- **Juxtaposition of Findings**: The dissertation's findings on enhancing user experience in banking contrast with the grant's goal of ensuring equitable power distribution. The grant summary states, "the need to rethink our institutions and technological development to ensure AI serves humanity positively," while the dissertation remains focused on a narrow technological application.

In summary, while the dissertation offers valuable insights into banking technology, it does not contribute meaningfully to the field of AI governance or power distribution as outlined in the grant objectives.
