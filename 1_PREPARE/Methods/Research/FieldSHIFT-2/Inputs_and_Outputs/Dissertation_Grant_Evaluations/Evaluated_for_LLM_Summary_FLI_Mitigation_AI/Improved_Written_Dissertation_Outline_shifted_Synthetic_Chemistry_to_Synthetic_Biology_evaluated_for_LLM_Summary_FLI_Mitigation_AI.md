# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems"

## I. Introduction

- **Summary of Dissertation's Main Topic and Research Questions**:
  The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems" explores the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and ecosystem dynamics. It proposes a transformative framework that integrates chemical principles into ecological studies, aiming to enhance our understanding of biodiversity, resilience, and energy flow in ecosystems. The research questions focus on modeling ecosystems as systems of reactions, examining the role of keystone species as catalysts, and applying chemical equilibrium principles to biodiversity.

- **Overall Impression**:
  The dissertation presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach to ecology that could potentially inform conservation strategies and ecological management. However, its relevance to the Future of Life Institute (FLI) grant objectives—specifically addressing AI-driven power concentration—appears limited. While the dissertation contributes significantly to ecological theory, it does not directly engage with the pressing issues of AI governance or societal power dynamics as outlined in the grant.

- **Key Mission of the Organization**:
  The FLI's mission is to mitigate risks associated with AI-driven power concentration and ensure that AI enhances human agency rather than diminishes it. The dissertation, while innovative in its field, does not align closely with this mission, focusing instead on ecological dynamics without addressing the implications of AI in power structures.

## II. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**:
  The dissertation's focus on ecological systems and chemical interactions does not directly address FLI's objectives related to AI and power distribution. The grant aims to support projects that explore public AI development, individual-centric AI systems, and governance structures that prevent power concentration. The dissertation's themes, while significant in ecological research, do not intersect with these areas.

- **Specific Examples**:
  - The dissertation introduces the concept of "Ecosystem Reactions," which classifies species interactions as chemical reactions. While this is an innovative approach within ecology, it lacks direct applicability to the grant's goals of addressing AI-driven power dynamics.
  - The research questions, such as "How can ecosystems be modeled as systems of reactions?" and "What role do keystone species play as catalysts in ecosystem dynamics?" are focused on ecological interactions and do not engage with the implications of AI technologies or power structures in society.

- **Quantitative Measures**:
  The alignment of the dissertation with the grant's focus areas can be quantitatively assessed. Given that the dissertation primarily addresses ecological theory and does not engage with AI or societal governance, its relevance percentile could be estimated at around 10-15%. This low percentile indicates a significant disconnect between the dissertation's focus and the grant's objectives.
