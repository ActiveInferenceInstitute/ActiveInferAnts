# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## I. Introduction

- **Summary of Dissertation's Main Topic and Research Questions**:
  The dissertation explores the intersection of neural networks and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a theoretical framework that interprets Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements. The research questions focus on how Blake's themes can be modeled as neural networks, the dynamics of neural communication in understanding his artistic expression, and the interdisciplinary implications for neuroscience, literary studies, and education.

- **Overall Impression**:
  The dissertation presents an innovative approach that merges cognitive science with literary analysis, offering a unique perspective on Blake's work. However, the relevance to the Future of Life Institute's (FLI) grant objectives—specifically addressing AI-driven power concentration—is limited. While the dissertation contributes to cognitive understanding and artistic engagement, it does not directly tackle issues of power distribution or governance in AI.

- **Organization's Mission and Alignment**:
  FLI's mission focuses on mitigating AI-driven power concentration to promote equitable power distribution. The dissertation, while intellectually stimulating, primarily engages with artistic interpretation rather than the socio-political implications of AI technologies. Thus, it does not align closely with the grant's objectives.

## II. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**:
  The dissertation's focus on neural networks and artistic themes does not directly intersect with FLI's focus areas, such as public AI development, individual-centric AI assistants, or legal mechanisms to counteract power concentration. For instance, the grant emphasizes the need for practical solutions to AI governance, while the dissertation remains theoretical and literary in its approach.

- **Examples from the Dissertation**:
  - The dissertation states, “By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work” (p. 12). This integration does not address the pressing issues of AI governance and power concentration outlined by FLI.
  - The proposal of “thematic neurons” and “cognitive resonance” (p. 45) is innovative but lacks application to the grant's focus on societal benefits and equitable power distribution.

- **Quantitative Measures**:
  Based on the grant's focus areas, the dissertation's relevance can be assessed at approximately 15%. While it offers interdisciplinary insights, it does not propose actionable solutions or frameworks that align with FLI's objectives.

## III. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback

1. **Strongly Positive Perspective**:
   - The interdisciplinary approach is commendable. The integration of neuroscience with literary studies can inspire new research avenues.
   - *Quote*: “This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two traditionally distinct fields—neuroscience and literature” (p. 6).

2. **Positive Perspective**:
   - The methodological rigor is evident, employing mixed methods to explore cognitive engagement.
   - *Quote*: “The analysis will utilize neural network modeling to explore thematic connections” (p. 35).

3. **Neutral Perspective**:
   - While innovative, the relevance to AI governance is tangential. The dissertation would benefit from a clearer connection to societal implications.
   - *Quote*: “By examining Blake's work through the lens of neural networks, this dissertation aims to uncover the underlying cognitive processes” (p. 20).

4. **Negative Perspective**:
   - The dissertation lacks a direct application to current issues in AI. It does not propose frameworks or models that could mitigate AI-driven power concentration.
   - *Quote*: “This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism” (p. 8), but fails to address the pressing challenges posed by AI.

5. **Strongly Negative Perspective**:
   - The work does not align with the grant's mission. There is a missed opportunity to connect Blake's themes with contemporary AI challenges.
   - *Quote*: “The potential impact of this work extends beyond literary studies” (p. 3), yet does not engage with FLI’s objectives.

6. **Overall Feedback**:
   - The dissertation is well-structured and raises interesting questions but ultimately falls short of addressing the grant's focus on AI and power dynamics.

## IV. Contribution to the Field

- **Overall Contribution**:
  The dissertation contributes significantly to literary studies and cognitive science by proposing a novel framework for understanding artistic expression. However, its contribution to the field of AI governance is minimal.

- **Comparison with Grant Focus Areas**:
  - The grant emphasizes innovative solutions to counteract AI-driven power concentration. In contrast, the dissertation focuses on literary analysis without addressing governance or societal impact.
  - *Quote from Dissertation*: “By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, this dissertation offers fresh interpretations” (p. 15). This approach, while valuable, does not engage with the implications of AI technologies as emphasized in the grant.

- **Juxtaposition with Grant Summary**:
  The grant states, “Projects should focus on innovative solutions that address the unique challenges posed by AI.” The dissertation, while innovative in its own right, does not propose such solutions.

## V. Methodology and Data Analysis

- **Evaluation of Methodology**:
  The mixed-methods approach is appropriate for exploring the cognitive dimensions of literature. However, it lacks a direct application to the grant's requirements for societal impact and governance.

- **Effectiveness of Data Analysis Techniques**:
  The use of neural network modeling is innovative but does not address the implications of AI technologies in the context of power concentration. The qualitative analysis of reader responses is insightful but not directly relevant to the grant's objectives.

- **Limitations**:
  The dissertation does not engage with practical applications or frameworks that could address the issues outlined by FLI. The focus remains on theoretical exploration rather than actionable outcomes.

## VI. Writing and Structure

- **Quality of Writing**:
  The dissertation is well-written, with clear organization and logical flow. The integration of citations and figures enhances the presentation.

- **Use of Citations and Figures**:
  The dissertation effectively utilizes citations from both literary and cognitive science sources, providing a solid theoretical foundation. However, the figures illustrating thematic connections could be more explicitly tied to the implications for AI governance.

## VII. Recommendations for Improvement

- **Actionable Recommendations**:
  - Integrate discussions on the societal implications of AI technologies and how Blake's themes can inform contemporary debates on power concentration.
  - Develop a section that explicitly connects the theoretical framework to practical applications in AI governance, addressing FLI's objectives.

- **Enhancing Quality and Impact**:
  By focusing on the implications of cognitive processes for AI governance, the dissertation could significantly enhance its relevance to the grant. *Quote from Grant*: “The potential of the project to effect meaningful change in the landscape of AI governance” should be a guiding principle for revisions.

## VIII. Conclusion

- **Summary of Evaluation**:
  The dissertation presents a unique interdisciplinary approach that enriches literary studies and cognitive science. However, it lacks direct relevance to the FLI grant objectives concerning AI-driven power concentration.

- **Final Assessment**:
  While the dissertation is intellectually stimulating and methodologically sound, it does not align closely with the grant's mission. Addressing the societal implications of AI and proposing actionable frameworks would enhance its relevance and impact. Overall, the dissertation's contribution to literature and cognitive science is significant, but its connection to FLI’s objectives remains weak. 33.206756591796875
