# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to the Free Energy Principle"

## I. Introduction

- **Summary of Dissertation**:  
  The dissertation explores the intersection of neural networks and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates principles from both fields. It examines hierarchical organization, dynamic adaptation, and information processing to develop a unified model that enhances understanding of cognitive processes. The key research questions focus on how neural networks inform predictive coding within the FEP, the role of synaptic plasticity, and the optimization of hierarchical structures for free energy minimization.

- **Overall Impression**:  
  This dissertation presents a novel and ambitious approach that could contribute significantly to both artificial intelligence and cognitive science. However, its relevance to the Future of Life Institute's (FLI) grant program, which aims to mitigate AI-driven power concentration, is somewhat tangential. While the research addresses cognitive processes and adaptive behavior, it does not directly tackle the pressing issues of power concentration or equitable distribution of AI resources.

- **Alignment with FLI's Mission**:  
  The Future of Life Institute aims to ensure that AI enhances human agency and prevents power centralization. The dissertation's focus on cognitive mechanisms and neural networks does not align directly with FLI’s objectives of countering AI-driven power concentration. Thus, while the research is innovative and potentially impactful, it does not fit neatly within the scope of FLI’s grant program.

## II. Relevance to Grant

- **Assessment of Relevance**:  
  The dissertation's primary focus on cognitive processes and neural network dynamics does not align closely with FLI's objectives of addressing power concentration in AI. The research emphasizes theoretical advancements and practical applications within neuroscience and AI but lacks a direct examination of governance structures, public AI development, or individual-centric AI systems that FLI prioritizes.

- **Specific Examples**:  
  - The dissertation introduces concepts like "Generative Neural Networks" and "Hierarchical Free Energy Architecture," which are innovative but do not specifically address how to mitigate corporate monopolies or government surveillance through AI. For instance, the statement, "This work not only contributes to theoretical discourse but also lays the groundwork for practical applications in artificial intelligence and neuroscience," while promising, does not provide clear pathways to counteract power concentration.
  - The exploration of "neurofeedback mechanisms" and their applications in cognitive training could have indirect implications for individual empowerment but lacks a robust connection to the broader societal implications of power dynamics in AI.

- **Quantitative Measures**:  
  The dissertation does not present quantitative measures or relevance percentiles directly related to FLI's focus areas. It would benefit from incorporating empirical evaluations of how its findings could influence AI governance or contribute to frameworks for equitable AI development.
