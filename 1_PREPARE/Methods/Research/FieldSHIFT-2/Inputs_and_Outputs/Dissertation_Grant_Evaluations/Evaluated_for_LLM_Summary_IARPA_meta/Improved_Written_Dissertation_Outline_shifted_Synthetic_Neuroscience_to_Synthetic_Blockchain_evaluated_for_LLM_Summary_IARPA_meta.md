As stated in the dissertation, “the hypothesis that adaptive consensus improves transaction validation speed and energy efficiency will be tested through simulation modeling.” This aligns with IARPA’s interest in developing sustainable technologies that enhance operational capabilities.

- **Intelligent Smart Contracts:** The development of smart contracts that learn from historical data and adapt their conditions is particularly relevant. The dissertation notes, “a framework for smart contracts that adapt based on historical interactions will be proposed,” which could enhance decision-making processes in intelligence operations. This directly correlates with IARPA's focus on human language technology and data analytics.

- **Interoperability Solutions:** The dissertation addresses current challenges in blockchain interoperability, proposing a neuro-inspired framework for enhanced communication between blockchains. This is crucial for intelligence operations that require seamless data sharing across different systems, aligning with IARPA's objectives for improved data analytics and operational efficiency.

### Quantitative Measures of Alignment

In assessing the alignment of the dissertation with IARPA’s goals, it is useful to consider quantitative measures such as relevance percentiles. Given the innovative nature of the proposed research, it could be positioned in the top 20% of relevant projects for IARPA’s focus on advanced technologies. The integration of neural networks into blockchain could be seen as a novel approach that addresses multiple IARPA focus areas, suggesting a strong potential for funding and support.
