### Neutral Perspective:
- **Limited Direct Impact**: While the research is well-structured, its impact on federal procurement processes is limited. The dissertation does not address how its findings could influence SAM's functionalities, leading to a neutral assessment of its relevance.

### Negative Perspective:
- **Lack of Alignment**: The core focus on hospitality management diverges significantly from SAM's objectives. The dissertation does not engage with federal contracting or grant management, which are essential components of the SAM grant.

### Strongly Negative Perspective:
- **Irrelevant Content**: The dissertation fails to address any aspects related to federal procurement or award processes. A reviewer might note, "The principles discussed do not connect with the operational realities of federal contracting," highlighting the disconnect between the research and the grant's mission.

### Overall Rationale:
The dissertation's innovative nature is acknowledged, but its lack of alignment with SAM's core objectives leads to an overall assessment of limited relevance. The focus on hospitality rather than federal procurement processes places it outside the grant's intended scope.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the field of hospitality management by introducing a novel framework that integrates chemical principles into guest experience design. This interdisciplinary approach provides a structured methodology for enhancing service delivery and guest satisfaction.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives:
- The SAM grant emphasizes efficiency and transparency in federal procurement. In contrast, the dissertation prioritizes guest experience and operational efficiency within hospitality, indicating a fundamental divergence in focus.
- The dissertation states, "This research can lead to the development of new frameworks and methodologies that improve service delivery," which could inspire indirect applications in sectors that engage with SAM, but does not directly contribute to SAM's objectives.

### Juxtaposition of Findings:
- The dissertation's emphasis on "holistic experience" contrasts with SAM's focus on compliance and efficiency. The quote, "By framing guest experience through the lens of chemical principles," illustrates the novelty of the approach, yet it does not address the need for transparency and efficiency in federal contracting.

Overall, while the dissertation contributes significantly to hospitality management, its findings do not align with the SAM grant's objectives, limiting its relevance to the grant's mission.
