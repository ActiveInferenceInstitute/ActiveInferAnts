## 2. Relevance to Grant

The CHIPS for America grant emphasizes several focus areas: strengthening supply chain resilience, advancing U.S. technology leadership, supporting U.S. fab clusters, and enhancing national security. The dissertation, however, primarily addresses guest experience in the hospitality sector without any direct implications for semiconductor technology or manufacturing.

### Key Misalignments:
- **Supply Chain Resilience**: The dissertation does not address supply chain management or resilience in semiconductor manufacturing. For example, while it discusses the optimization of guest experiences through chemical principles, it lacks any discussion on how these principles could be applied to supply chain dynamics in the semiconductor industry.
  
- **Technology Leadership**: The research does not contribute to advancing technology leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. It focuses on hospitality management rather than innovations in semiconductor processes or materials. 

- **Workforce Development**: Although the dissertation discusses the importance of staff empowerment in hospitality, it does not address the critical need for workforce training and development in the semiconductor sector, which is a significant aspect of the CHIPS grant.

### Quantitative Measures:
- **Funding/Relevance Percentiles**: Given that the dissertation is centered on hospitality and chemical principles, it would likely fall below the 10th percentile in relevance to the CHIPS for America grant objectives. The focus areas of the grant, such as advanced packaging, semiconductor materials, and manufacturing technologies, are not addressed in this research.

### Conclusion on Relevance:
Overall, while the dissertation introduces innovative ideas for enhancing guest experiences in hospitality, it does not align with the key objectives of the CHIPS for America grant. It lacks any direct application or relevance to semiconductor technology and manufacturing, thus rendering it largely irrelevant to the grant's goals.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
