# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation for IARPA REASON Program Grant

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Blockchain Technology" explores the innovative intersection between chemical principles and blockchain systems. The research seeks to address key challenges in blockchain technology—such as transaction validation, scalability, and efficiency—by applying concepts from chemistry, including catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics. The overarching research questions focus on the application of these chemical principles to enhance blockchain transaction processes and improve overall network performance.

Overall, the dissertation presents a unique interdisciplinary approach that, while innovative, does not align directly with the objectives of the IARPA REASON Program Grant. The REASON Program emphasizes enhancing the quality of argumentation in intelligence analysis through automated technologies, focusing on evidence utilization and reasoning assessment in intelligence reports. In contrast, this dissertation primarily addresses technical challenges in blockchain technology without a clear connection to intelligence analysis or argumentation quality.

The mission of the IARPA REASON Program is to improve the effectiveness of intelligence operations through enhanced analytical techniques. While the dissertation contributes to the field of blockchain technology, it lacks direct relevance to the program's objectives, which focus on intelligence analysis rather than technological innovations in decentralized systems.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The REASON Program aims to develop technologies that enhance the quality of argumentation in intelligence analysis reports. This involves identifying relevant evidence, assessing reasoning strengths and weaknesses, and producing comments to improve argumentation quality. The dissertation, however, primarily investigates the application of chemical principles to improve blockchain technology, with no explicit focus on intelligence analysis or evidence evaluation.

### Key Areas of Misalignment

- **Focus on Blockchain vs. Intelligence Analysis**: The dissertation concentrates on blockchain technology, proposing consensus mechanisms and dynamic load balancing strategies to enhance transaction throughput and scalability. This focus diverges from the REASON Program's emphasis on improving argumentation quality in intelligence reports.

- **Lack of Evidence Utilization Framework**: The dissertation does not provide a framework for identifying or evaluating evidence in the context of intelligence analysis. Instead, it presents theoretical constructs aimed at optimizing blockchain systems without consideration for the specific needs of intelligence analysts.

- **No Direct Connection to Argumentation Quality**: The proposed research does not address the REASON Program's goal of enhancing the quality of argumentation. While the dissertation discusses improving efficiency in blockchain networks, it does not relate these improvements to the quality of reasoning or argumentation in intelligence reports.

### Quantitative Measures of Relevance

Given the significant divergence in focus, the alignment of the dissertation with the REASON Program can be quantified as follows:

- **Funding/Relevance Percentile**: 10% relevance to IARPA REASON Program objectives, as the primary focus is on blockchain technology rather than intelligence analysis.
- **Alignment with Technical Challenges**: The dissertation does not address the specific technical challenges outlined in the REASON Program, resulting in a low alignment score.
