# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and literary analysis, specifically focusing on the life and works of William Blake. It poses three overarching research questions regarding the modeling of Blake's themes as neural networks, the dynamics of neural communication enhancing our understanding of his artistic expression, and the broader implications of this interdisciplinary approach for neuroscience, literary studies, and education. 

Overall, my impression of this dissertation is that it presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach that has the potential to enrich both literary criticism and cognitive science. However, in the context of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) grant objectives, which focus on enhancing the competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. manufacturers, the relevance of this dissertation is limited. The MEP's goals are primarily centered on practical applications in manufacturing, technology adoption, and workforce development, whereas this dissertation delves into theoretical frameworks that do not directly address these objectives.

### Mission Alignment
The MEP initiative aims to strengthen U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, promote innovation, and enhance workforce skills. While the dissertation contributes to the fields of cognitive science and literary studies, it does not align with the MEP's mission to bolster manufacturing practices or workforce development in a way that is actionable or applicable to the grant’s focus.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The dissertation's focus on neural networks and literary analysis does not directly relate to the MEP grant's objectives, which prioritize manufacturing competitiveness, technology integration, and workforce training. The MEP grant seeks to support initiatives that have tangible impacts on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the U.S. manufacturing sector. 

### Specific Examples
- The dissertation introduces the concept of **thematic neurons** and **cognitive resonance**, which are valuable in understanding artistic creativity but do not translate to practical applications in manufacturing or workforce development.
- The research emphasizes interdisciplinary insights between cognitive science and literature, stating that "this research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism and invites scholars to consider how cognitive science can inform our understanding of literature." While this is an interesting academic pursuit, it does not align with the MEP’s focus on enhancing manufacturing practices.

### Quantitative Measures
In terms of funding and relevance percentiles, the dissertation may align with academic funding in the humanities or cognitive sciences, but it would likely score very low (less than 20%) in terms of relevance to the MEP grant objectives, which prioritize economic impact, innovation in manufacturing, and workforce training.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the fields of cognitive science and literary studies by proposing a new framework for understanding artistic creativity through neural networks. It challenges traditional literary analysis by integrating cognitive processes into the study of literature, thus expanding the scope of both fields.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives
- The MEP grant focuses on enhancing manufacturing competitiveness and fostering innovation, while the dissertation emphasizes cognitive engagement and artistic interpretation.
- *Quote from Dissertation*: "By integrating these domains, this dissertation aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Blake's work."
- *Quote from Grant Summary*: "The MEP program is designed to achieve several key objectives: strengthening competitiveness, accelerating technology adoption, and promoting innovation."

In conclusion, while the dissertation presents a compelling case for interdisciplinary research, it does not directly contribute to the MEP's goals of enhancing manufacturing practices or workforce development.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. This approach is appropriate for the research questions posed, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes and their cognitive implications.

### Rigor and Limitations
- The qualitative analysis focuses on thematic exploration, while the quantitative modeling seeks to map these themes within a neural network framework.
- However, the methodology does not address any practical applications that could be utilized in manufacturing contexts, which is a key requirement for MEP funding.
- *Quote*: "This dual approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes and their cognitive implications."

## 6. Writing and Structure

The dissertation is well-written and organized, with clear sections that logically progress from the introduction to the conclusion. The use of citations is appropriate, and the visual representations of themes enhance understanding.

### Clarity and Standards
- The writing is clear, and the structure facilitates comprehension of complex ideas.
- However, the relevance of the content to manufacturing practices is lacking, which is a critical aspect of the MEP grant standards.
- *Quote*: "By examining how these concepts relate to Blake's work, this dissertation seeks to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework."

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the MEP grant objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Incorporate Practical Applications**: Integrate discussions on how cognitive insights can be applied to improve workforce training in manufacturing.
   - *Example*: Explore how understanding cognitive processes can lead to better training programs for manufacturing employees.
