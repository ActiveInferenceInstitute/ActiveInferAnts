# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality"

## 1. Introduction

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and guest experience in the hospitality industry. It aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances guest satisfaction and operational efficiency by applying concepts from chemistry—such as transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms—within the hospitality context. The overarching research questions focus on how these principles can be utilized to optimize guest experiences and operational practices.

Overall, the dissertation presents a novel approach that could significantly contribute to the field of hospitality management. However, its direct relevance to the objectives of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) grant is limited. The MEP program primarily aims to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of U.S. manufacturers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while this dissertation focuses on improving service delivery in hospitality. While there may be some overlapping themes, such as operational efficiency, the core focus of the dissertation does not align closely with the MEP’s objectives of fostering manufacturing innovation and workforce development.

The MEP's mission is to strengthen U.S. manufacturing through innovative practices and workforce enhancement. Therefore, while the dissertation demonstrates creativity and interdisciplinary thinking, it lacks clear relevance to the MEP grant’s primary focus areas.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The MEP grant emphasizes strengthening competitiveness, accelerating technology adoption, promoting innovation, increasing productivity, expanding the skilled workforce, and improving supply chain integration. The dissertation, while innovative in its approach, does not directly address these objectives.

1. **Strengthening Competitiveness**: The dissertation discusses enhancing guest satisfaction through a scientific framework, which could indirectly relate to competitiveness in hospitality. However, it does not provide insights applicable to manufacturing contexts. For example, the author states, “By framing guest experience through the lens of chemical principles, this dissertation seeks to provide actionable insights that can lead to improved operational efficiency” (p. 12). While operational efficiency is relevant, the specific application to manufacturing is unclear.

2. **Accelerating Technology Adoption**: The research does not focus on the adoption of advanced technologies in manufacturing processes. Instead, it emphasizes service delivery in hospitality. The lack of technological integration in manufacturing contexts limits its relevance to MEP goals.

3. **Promoting Innovation**: The dissertation introduces a novel framework for enhancing guest experiences, which is a form of innovation. However, the innovation is situated within hospitality rather than manufacturing. The MEP grant seeks innovations that can be broadly applied across manufacturing sectors, which this dissertation does not fulfill.

4. **Increasing Productivity**: While the dissertation mentions improving operational efficiency, it does not provide quantitative measures or case studies relevant to manufacturing productivity. The MEP grant emphasizes measurable impacts, such as the reported $16.2 billion in new and retained sales from MEP initiatives, which are not addressed in this work.

5. **Expanding the Skilled Workforce**: The dissertation does not discuss workforce development in manufacturing or how its findings could contribute to workforce training or skills development within the manufacturing sector.

6. **Improving Supply Chain Integration**: The focus on guest experience does not translate to supply chain considerations, making the dissertation less relevant to the MEP's objectives of enhancing collaboration and efficiency within manufacturing supply chains.

Quantitatively, the relevance of the dissertation to the MEP grant can be assessed as low, with an estimated relevance percentile of 20%. The primary focus on hospitality, without significant crossover to manufacturing principles or practices, limits its applicability to MEP's goals.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the field of hospitality management by proposing an interdisciplinary framework that applies chemical principles to enhance guest experiences. This approach is innovative and offers a fresh perspective on service delivery within hospitality.

However, when viewed through the lens of the MEP grant's objectives, the contribution appears limited. The MEP grant emphasizes enhancing manufacturing practices, workforce development, and operational efficiencies in manufacturing settings. The dissertation's findings, while valuable for hospitality, do not provide insights or methodologies applicable to manufacturing contexts.

For instance, the author states, “The application of chemical principles can lead to more efficient processes, improved guest satisfaction, and sustainable practices within the hospitality sector” (p. 45). While this is a significant contribution to hospitality, it does not address how these principles can be translated into manufacturing practices, thus limiting the dissertation's relevance to the MEP's focus areas.

In contrast, the MEP grant highlights the importance of “process improvement” and “innovation and technology transfer” in manufacturing. The lack of direct connections between the dissertation’s findings and these objectives underscores the limited contribution to the MEP's mission.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative component includes interviews and case studies, while the quantitative aspect comprises surveys designed to measure guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

While the methodology is appropriate for exploring the intersection of chemical principles and guest experience, it does not align with the MEP's requirements for rigorous quantitative analysis applicable to manufacturing contexts. The MEP grant emphasizes measurable impacts, such as cost savings and sales growth, which are not adequately addressed in the dissertation.

For example, the author states, “Statistical analysis will be utilized to analyze survey data, identifying correlations between guest satisfaction and service delivery practices” (p. 78). However, the lack of robust quantitative data specifically related to manufacturing limits the applicability of the findings to MEP objectives.

The data analysis techniques employed are effective for the hospitality context but may not meet the standards expected in manufacturing research. The absence of a clear connection to manufacturing processes and metrics raises concerns about the dissertation's overall rigor in relation to the MEP grant.

## 6. Writing and Structure

The overall quality of writing in the dissertation is commendable. The clarity and organization of the content effectively convey the research objectives and findings. The use of citations is appropriate, and the literature review is comprehensive, demonstrating a solid understanding of both chemical principles and hospitality management.

Figures and tables, where applicable, enhance the presentation of data and concepts. However, the relevance of these elements to manufacturing contexts is limited. The dissertation would benefit from a more explicit connection to the MEP grant's standards and practices, particularly in how the findings could translate to manufacturing settings.

Overall, the writing is clear and engaging, but the alignment with MEP's expectations for practical applications in manufacturing is lacking.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement

To enhance the dissertation's alignment with the MEP grant's objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Incorporate Manufacturing Case Studies**: Include case studies that demonstrate the application of chemical principles in manufacturing contexts. This would provide a clearer connection to MEP objectives and enhance the dissertation's relevance.

2. **Quantitative Analysis of Manufacturing Metrics**: Integrate quantitative data that measures the impact of the proposed framework on manufacturing productivity or operational efficiency. This would strengthen the empirical foundation of the research.

3. **Focus on Workforce Development**: Explore how the proposed framework could inform workforce training and development in manufacturing settings. This would align the dissertation with MEP's emphasis on expanding the skilled workforce.

4. **Address Supply Chain Integration**: Investigate how the principles outlined in the dissertation could enhance supply chain practices within manufacturing. This would broaden the applicability of the research findings.

5. **Engage with Industry Stakeholders**: Collaborate with manufacturing professionals to gain insights into the practical challenges they face and how the proposed framework could address these issues.
