While the theoretical framework is sound, practical guidance on implementation would enhance its relevance. The author states, "Recommendations for regulatory frameworks to support the integration of advanced technologies in banking will be discussed" (Practical Applications).

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the fields of banking technology and human-computer interaction, particularly through its innovative application of neural networks. The potential for adaptive ATM systems to enhance user experience aligns with the SPO's objectives of fostering innovation and improving competitiveness in U.S. industries.

Comparatively, the grant emphasizes the importance of advanced manufacturing and emerging technologies. The dissertation's findings on adaptive ATM systems reflect the SPO's commitment to integrating technology in a way that enhances operational efficiency. For instance, the dissertation states, "By developing a framework for 'Synaptic Transactions,' we can explore how ATMs can adapt based on user behavior" (New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift). This aligns with the SPO's focus on technology transfer and collaboration across sectors.

Moreover, the dissertation addresses the critical area of cybersecurity, which is a key focus of the NICE initiative.
