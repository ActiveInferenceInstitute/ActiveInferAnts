## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of textile design by proposing a novel framework that integrates neural network principles. However, when viewed through the lens of the NSF PDaSP program's objectives, the contribution is limited.

### Comparison with Grant Focus Areas:
- The PDaSP program emphasizes practical applications of privacy-preserving technologies, whereas the dissertation focuses on design innovation without addressing data privacy. For instance, the grant states, "Foster innovative, use-inspired research that transitions theoretical models into practical applications," which is not reflected in the dissertation's focus on textiles.
- The dissertation's findings on consumer engagement and sustainability do not contribute to the development of tools or methodologies for privacy-preserving data sharing, which is a primary goal of the PDaSP program.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes:
- Dissertation Quote: "This research aims to enhance creativity, sustainability, and consumer engagement in the fabric arts."
- Grant Quote: "Develop tools, measurement methods, and testbeds to enhance the usability and inclusiveness of privacy-preserving data sharing solutions."

In summary, while the dissertation advances knowledge in textile design, it does not contribute to the field of privacy-preserving data sharing as outlined in the PDaSP program.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the integration of neural networks into textile design. However, this methodology does not align with the PDaSP program's emphasis on data privacy.

### Evaluation of Methodology:
- The use of surveys and interviews to gather insights from stakeholders is appropriate for exploring consumer engagement but lacks a focus on privacy implications.
- The experimental design for prototyping adaptive textiles is innovative; however, it does not address the ethical considerations of data usage or privacy.

### Data Analysis Techniques:
- Statistical analysis is employed to identify trends in consumer preferences, but the analysis does not evaluate any privacy-related outcomes or implications, which is crucial for the PDaSP program.
- Qualitative analysis of consumer feedback is insightful, yet it fails to incorporate discussions on privacy concerns or ethical considerations surrounding data sharing.

In conclusion, while the methodology is rigorous, it does not meet the PDaSP program's requirements for addressing privacy-preserving data sharing.
