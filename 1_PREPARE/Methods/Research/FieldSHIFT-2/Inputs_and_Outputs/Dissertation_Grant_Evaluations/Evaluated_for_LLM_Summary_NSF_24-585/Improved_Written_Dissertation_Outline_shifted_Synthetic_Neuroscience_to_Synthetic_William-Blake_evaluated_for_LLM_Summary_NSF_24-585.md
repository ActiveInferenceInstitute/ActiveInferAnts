# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and the literary themes present in the works of William Blake. The primary research questions focus on modeling Blake's themes as neural networks, understanding the dynamics of neural communication in relation to his artistic expression, and investigating the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for neuroscience, literary studies, and education. 

Overall, the dissertation presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach that bridges cognitive science and literature, which could have implications for the broader understanding of creativity and artistic expression. However, while the dissertation is innovative and offers fresh insights into literary analysis, its relevance to the NSF PDaSP program's objectives—specifically focused on privacy-preserving data sharing technologies—appears limited. The PDaSP program emphasizes practical applications of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in data sharing, which is not a central theme of this dissertation. The mission of the NSF PDaSP program is to foster innovative research that directly contributes to the development of practical solutions for privacy-preserving data sharing, whereas this dissertation primarily contributes to literary and cognitive studies.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The dissertation's relevance to the NSF PDaSP program is tenuous. The PDaSP program aims to foster innovative research that transitions theoretical models into practical applications, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving data sharing technologies. Although the dissertation presents a unique theoretical framework by applying neural network concepts to literary analysis, it does not directly address the grant's focus areas or objectives.

### Specific Examples:
- The dissertation states, "By leveraging concepts from neuroscience—including synaptic plasticity, neural oscillations, and cognitive resonance—this research seeks to uncover deeper insights into Blake's artistic vision." While this is an interesting exploration, it does not align with the PDaSP's goal of developing PETs or practical applications for data sharing.
- The research questions proposed, such as "How can Blake's themes be modeled as neural networks?" and "What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for the fields of neuroscience, literary studies, and education?" focus on literary analysis rather than practical technological applications.

### Quantitative Measures:
Using relevance percentiles, the dissertation may fall below the threshold for alignment with the NSF PDaSP program's focus areas. Given that the program emphasizes practical solutions for privacy-preserving data sharing, the dissertation's contributions to cognitive science and literary studies may not meet the funding criteria. 

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
### Strongly Positive
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: The innovative integration of neural networks and literary analysis is commendable and could inspire future interdisciplinary research.
- **Thematic Exploration**: The identification of "thematic neurons" and their connections offers a fresh perspective on literary criticism.

### Positive
- **Cognitive Insights**: The exploration of cognitive processes in artistic engagement is valuable for understanding creativity.
- **Potential for New Fields**: The dissertation lays the groundwork for the development of a new interdisciplinary field, which could lead to exciting research opportunities.

### Neutral
- **Limited Practical Applications**: While the theoretical framework is robust, its practical applications in the context of privacy-preserving data sharing are unclear.
- **Scope of Research**: The focus on Blake's work may limit the applicability of findings to broader contexts.

### Negative
- **Misalignment with Grant Objectives**: The dissertation does not address the specific needs for privacy-preserving technologies, which is a central goal of the PDaSP program.
- **Lack of Technological Focus**: The absence of a focus on developing tools or methodologies for data sharing diminishes its relevance to the grant.

### Strongly Negative
- **No Connection to Data Sharing**: The dissertation does not discuss privacy, data sharing, or PETs, which are critical components of the PDaSP program.
- **Limited Societal Impact**: The societal implications of the research are primarily within literary studies, lacking broader relevance to data privacy issues.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the fields of cognitive science and literary studies by proposing an innovative framework that combines neural network principles with literary analysis. This interdisciplinary approach challenges traditional boundaries and encourages scholars to explore the cognitive dimensions of artistic engagement.

### Comparison with Grant Objectives:
- The PDaSP program emphasizes the development of practical applications for privacy-preserving data sharing. In contrast, the dissertation focuses on understanding Blake's themes through neural network modeling, which does not directly contribute to the grant's goals.
- The grant encourages innovative research that transitions theoretical models into practical applications, whereas the dissertation remains largely theoretical and does not provide actionable insights relevant to data sharing technologies.

### Quotes:
- The dissertation states, "This research challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism," highlighting its innovative approach. However, the relevance to the PDaSP program's objectives remains unclear.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis
The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. This dual approach is appropriate for exploring the cognitive implications of Blake's work.

### Evaluation of Methodology:
- **Qualitative Analysis**: The thematic exploration of Blake's work is well-structured, providing insights into the emotional and cognitive dimensions of his artistry.
- **Quantitative Modeling**: The use of neural network modeling to map thematic connections is innovative, although its application within the context of privacy-preserving data sharing is absent.

### Limitations:
- The dissertation lacks a clear connection to practical applications or technologies that could address privacy concerns, which is a significant limitation in the context of the PDaSP program.

## 6. Writing and Structure
The dissertation is well-written, organized, and clearly articulated. The use of citations is appropriate, and the figures and tables effectively illustrate key concepts.

### Assessment:
- The structure of the dissertation facilitates understanding of complex ideas, making it accessible to readers from both literary and cognitive science backgrounds.
- However, the writing could benefit from a more explicit connection to the practical implications of the research, particularly concerning the PDaSP program's objectives.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
To enhance the dissertation's alignment with the PDaSP program's objectives, the following recommendations are proposed:
- **Incorporate Practical Applications**: Explore how neural network principles can be applied to develop privacy-preserving technologies or methodologies.
- **Address Data Sharing**: Integrate discussions on the implications of Blake's themes for contemporary issues in data privacy and sharing.
- **Develop Testbed Proposals**: Consider proposing experimental designs or testbeds that could be utilized in the context of privacy-preserving data sharing.

### Supporting Quotes:
- The grant summary emphasizes the need for "tools, measurement methods, and testbeds to enhance the usability and inclusiveness of privacy-preserving data sharing solutions." Aligning the dissertation with these objectives could strengthen its relevance.

## 8. Conclusion
In summary, the dissertation "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that contributes to cognitive science and literary studies. However, its relevance to the NSF PDaSP program is limited due to a lack of focus on privacy-preserving data sharing technologies. While the dissertation's strengths lie in its innovative theoretical framework and potential for interdisciplinary collaboration, it would benefit from a clearer connection to the practical applications emphasized by the grant. Overall, while the work is commendable, it does not align closely enough with the PDaSP program's objectives to warrant funding consideration. 26.516301155090332
