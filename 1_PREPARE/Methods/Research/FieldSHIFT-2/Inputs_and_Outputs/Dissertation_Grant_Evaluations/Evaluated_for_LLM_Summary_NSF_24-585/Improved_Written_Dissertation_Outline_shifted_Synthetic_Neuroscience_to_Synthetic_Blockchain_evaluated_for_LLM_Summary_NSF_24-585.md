## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to Blockchain" explores the integration of neural network principles into blockchain technology, proposing a framework termed "Neurochain." The primary research questions focus on how neural networks can enhance blockchain functionality, the development of novel consensus mechanisms based on neural plasticity, and the creation of adaptive smart contracts that learn from historical data. 

Overall, this work presents an innovative intersection of two critical fields—artificial intelligence and blockchain technology—which aligns with the objectives of the NSF PDaSP program to foster privacy-preserving data sharing technologies. The NSF aims to support research that transitions theoretical models into practical applications, and this dissertation's exploration of adaptive mechanisms and intelligent contracts could contribute significantly to enhancing the usability and inclusiveness of privacy-preserving solutions.

The mission of the NSF is to advance the progress of science and engineering in the United States for the benefit of society. The dissertation aligns with the NSF’s objectives by proposing novel methodologies that could lead to practical applications in data sharing while addressing privacy concerns. However, while the dissertation presents innovative ideas, its direct relevance to the specific focus areas of the PDaSP program may be limited, as it does not explicitly address privacy-preserving technologies or data sharing frameworks.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The PDaSP program emphasizes the development of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and practical applications for data sharing. The dissertation's focus on enhancing blockchain functionality through neural principles presents an intriguing approach, but it lacks a direct connection to privacy preservation. 

- **Alignment with Grant Goals**: 
    - The dissertation's exploration of "Adaptive Consensus Mechanisms" can indirectly support the PDaSP goal of enhancing usability in decentralized systems. For instance, the proposed adaptive consensus model aims to improve transaction validation speed and energy efficiency, which could facilitate faster data sharing processes. However, the dissertation does not specifically address how these mechanisms can incorporate privacy-preserving measures.
    - The concept of "Learning Smart Contracts" aligns with the PDaSP's goal of developing comprehensive solutions for trustworthy data sharing. The dissertation proposes that learning smart contracts can adapt based on historical interactions, potentially enhancing their effectiveness in data transactions. However, the implications for privacy and security are not thoroughly explored.

- **Quantitative Measures**: 
    - The dissertation could be evaluated against the PDaSP funding track criteria. While it proposes innovative theoretical constructs, it does not provide sufficient empirical evidence or case studies that demonstrate practical applications of these constructs in the context of privacy preservation and data sharing.
    - The relevance percentile for this dissertation in relation to the PDaSP program could be estimated at around 60%, indicating that while there are innovative ideas present, the focus on privacy-preserving technologies is minimal.
