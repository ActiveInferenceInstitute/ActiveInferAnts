# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work"

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" explores the intersection of neural networks and the artistic themes present in the works of William Blake. The research questions focus on how Blake's themes can be modeled as neural networks, the implications of neural communication dynamics on understanding Blake's artistic expressions, and the interdisciplinary relevance of this approach to fields such as neuroscience, literary studies, and education. 

Overall, the dissertation presents a novel and interdisciplinary approach that, while innovative, diverges significantly from the objectives of the NSF 24-586 grant focused on advancing quantum technologies. The key mission of the NSF is to foster the development of practical quantum technologies through collaborative efforts across academia, industry, and government. The dissertation’s focus on literary analysis and cognitive science does not align with the grant's emphasis on quantum science and technology demonstrations. Therefore, it is not relevant to the NSF NQVL grant objectives.

## 2. Relevance to Grant
The NSF 24-586 grant aims to advance quantum technologies and their practical applications, particularly through the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory initiative. The focus areas include the scientific and engineering core of quantum technology projects, emphasizing the need for proposals that demonstrate a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage.

### Assessment of Relevance
- **Core Focus Areas**: The dissertation does not address any of the core focus areas outlined in the grant. For instance, it does not engage with quantum technology, experimentation, or the engineering aspects of quantum systems. The research is centered around literary analysis and neuroscience, which are outside the scope of the grant's objectives.
  
- **Examples from the Dissertation**: While the dissertation provides a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes through the lens of neural networks, quotes such as “thematic neurons represent central themes in Blake's work” and “cognitive resonance reflects how readers interact with Blake's work” do not connect to any quantum technology or its applications.

- **Quantitative Measures**: The funding relevance percentiles for the dissertation would likely be extremely low, likely below the 10th percentile, as it does not contribute to the technological advancements or practical solutions that the NSF seeks to promote.

### Conclusion on Relevance
In summary, the dissertation lacks alignment with the grant's focus areas and objectives. The NSF NQVL grant specifically seeks advancements in quantum technologies, while the dissertation delves into literary analysis and cognitive processes, making it irrelevant to the grant's mission.

## 3. Anticipatory Grant Reviewer Feedback
### Strongly Positive
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: The innovative integration of neuroscience with literary analysis is commendable. The research could inspire new methodologies in humanities research.

### Positive
- **Theoretical Framework**: The introduction of “thematic neurons” and “cognitive resonance” provides a fresh perspective on literary themes, which may resonate with scholars in cognitive science.

### Neutral
- **Literature Review**: While the literature review is thorough, it does not engage with contemporary discussions in quantum science, which is a critical aspect of the grant.

### Negative
- **Lack of Practical Applications**: The dissertation does not present any practical applications that could be relevant to technological development, a key requirement of the grant.

### Strongly Negative
- **Misalignment with Grant Objectives**: The overall focus on Blake's life and work fails to address any of the scientific or engineering challenges outlined in the NSF proposal, rendering it unsuitable for funding consideration.

### Critical
- **Absence of Quantum Focus**: The dissertation does not mention quantum technologies, experiments, or their implications, which are essential for alignment with the NSF grant objectives.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
The dissertation makes a significant contribution to the field of literary studies and cognitive science by exploring the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation. However, when viewed through the lens of the NSF grant objectives, the work does not contribute to the advancement of quantum technologies.

### Comparison of Findings
- **Dissertation Findings**: The research highlights the dynamic nature of Blake’s themes as interconnected elements within a neural network, suggesting that “themes evolve over time in response to various influences.” This contributes to a deeper understanding of literary analysis but does not intersect with quantum technology.

- **Grant Objectives**: The NSF grant emphasizes the need for clear pathways to achieving quantum advantage, focusing on practical applications and community engagement in quantum technology. The dissertation’s findings do not align with these objectives.

### Conclusion on Contribution
While the dissertation enriches the discourse in literary studies and cognitive science, it does not contribute to the grant’s focus areas of quantum science and technology, indicating a clear disconnect.

## 5. Methodology and Data Analysis
The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. This dual approach is appropriate for its research questions but does not meet the methodological requirements typically expected in proposals related to quantum technology.

### Evaluation of Methodology
- **Appropriateness**: The mixed-methods approach is suitable for exploring the cognitive dimensions of literature. However, it lacks any elements related to experimental design or technological application relevant to the NSF grant.

- **Data Analysis Techniques**: The dissertation uses neural network modeling to explore thematic connections. While effective for its aims, it does not demonstrate any rigor in terms of scientific experimentation or technological implementation.

### Limitations
- The absence of empirical data related to quantum technologies significantly limits the dissertation's applicability to the grant objectives.

## 6. Writing and Structure
The dissertation is well-structured and clearly written, with coherent arguments and a logical flow of ideas. The use of citations is appropriate, and the figures and tables effectively illustrate the proposed theoretical framework.

### Assessment of Writing Quality
- **Clarity and Organization**: The writing is clear and engaging, making complex ideas accessible. However, it does not adhere to the technical standards expected in proposals for scientific research.

- **Use of Citations**: The citations are relevant to the fields of literary studies and cognitive science but do not include any references to quantum science, which is a critical oversight for alignment with the NSF grant.

## 7. Recommendations for Improvement
To enhance the dissertation's relevance to the NSF grant objectives, the following recommendations are suggested:

- **Incorporate Quantum Concepts**: Integrate discussions on quantum technologies and their potential implications for cognitive science and literary analysis. This could include exploring parallels between neural networks and quantum computing.

- **Focus on Practical Applications**: Develop a section that outlines how the findings could inform or contribute to advancements in quantum technology or education, aligning with the NSF's emphasis on practical solutions.

- **Engage with Interdisciplinary Collaborations**: Seek collaborations with researchers in quantum science to bridge the gap between the two fields, potentially leading to innovative research outcomes.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, while the dissertation "Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work" presents a compelling interdisciplinary exploration of literature and cognitive science, it ultimately lacks relevance to the NSF 24-586 grant focused on advancing quantum technologies. The dissertation excels in its clarity, structure, and innovative approach, but it does not align with the grant’s objectives or requirements. Significant improvements would be needed to establish a connection between the research and the goals of the NSF grant. 22.287775993347168
