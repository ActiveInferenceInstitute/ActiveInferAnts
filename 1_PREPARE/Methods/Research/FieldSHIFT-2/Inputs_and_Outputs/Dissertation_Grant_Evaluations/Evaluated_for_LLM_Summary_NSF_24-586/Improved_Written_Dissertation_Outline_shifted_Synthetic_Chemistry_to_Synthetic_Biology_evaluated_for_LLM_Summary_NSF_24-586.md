# Evaluation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems" explores the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and ecosystem dynamics, proposing a transformative framework that reinterprets ecosystems through chemical principles. The research questions focus on modeling ecosystems as systems of reactions, understanding the role of keystone species as catalysts, and applying chemical equilibrium principles to biodiversity. Overall, the work presents a compelling synthesis of chemistry and ecology, which is particularly relevant to the NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) grant objectives, specifically in fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and advancing scientific understanding.

The mission of the NSF NQVL program is to advance quantum technologies that provide practical solutions to real-world problems, emphasizing the integration of diverse talents across sectors. While the dissertation primarily addresses ecological and chemical principles, its interdisciplinary approach and potential implications for ecosystem management resonate with the NQVL's goals of fostering collaboration and innovative problem-solving. However, the direct relevance to quantum technologies is limited, suggesting that while the dissertation contributes to scientific discourse, it may not align closely with the NQVL's specific focus on quantum science and technology demonstrations.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

### Assessment of Relevance

The dissertation presents a novel approach to understanding ecosystems through the lens of chemical reactions, which aligns with the NQVL's emphasis on innovative scientific methodologies. The integration of chemical principles into ecological studies could advance theoretical frameworks that have implications for broader scientific applications, including potential intersections with quantum technologies in modeling complex systems.

**Key Examples from the Dissertation:**
- The introduction of the "Shifted Domain" concept, which integrates chemical reactions into ecological dynamics, can foster interdisciplinary collaboration. As stated, "By framing ecosystems as dynamic systems of reactions, we can analyze species interactions and energy transformations in a structured manner."
- The proposed "Catalytic Keystone Species" framework offers a new perspective on species interactions, suggesting that certain species enhance ecosystem stability. This insight could inform conservation strategies that leverage understanding from both chemistry and ecology.

### Quantitative Measures
While the dissertation does not directly address quantum technologies, its interdisciplinary nature and focus on innovative frameworks can be quantitatively assessed in terms of relevance to the NQVL's objectives. If we were to assign a relevance percentile based on the alignment of the dissertationâ€™s findings with NQVL goals, it might fall in the 40-50% range. This reflects a significant contribution to scientific discourse but limited direct applicability to quantum technology development.
