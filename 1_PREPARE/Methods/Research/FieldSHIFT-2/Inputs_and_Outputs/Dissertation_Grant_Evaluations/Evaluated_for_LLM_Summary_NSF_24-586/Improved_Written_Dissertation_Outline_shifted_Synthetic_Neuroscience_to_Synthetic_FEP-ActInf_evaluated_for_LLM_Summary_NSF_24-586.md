# Dissertation Evaluation: Transposing Neural Networks to the Free Energy Principle

## 1. Introduction
The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Networks to the Free Energy Principle" explores the intersection of neural networks and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a framework that integrates concepts from both fields. The primary research questions address how neural network principles can enhance predictive coding within the FEP, the role of synaptic plasticity in updating generative models, and the optimization of free energy minimization through hierarchical structures in neural networks. 

Overall, this work presents significant theoretical advancements and practical applications that could inform the development of quantum technologies, particularly in areas aligned with the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) initiative. The mission of the NSF includes fostering the development of quantum technologies that provide practical solutions, which resonates with the dissertation's aim to create interdisciplinary models that enhance cognitive processes. However, while the dissertation is intellectually robust, its direct relevance to the specific objectives of the NQVL grant may be limited, as it primarily focuses on cognitive science and artificial intelligence rather than quantum technologies.
