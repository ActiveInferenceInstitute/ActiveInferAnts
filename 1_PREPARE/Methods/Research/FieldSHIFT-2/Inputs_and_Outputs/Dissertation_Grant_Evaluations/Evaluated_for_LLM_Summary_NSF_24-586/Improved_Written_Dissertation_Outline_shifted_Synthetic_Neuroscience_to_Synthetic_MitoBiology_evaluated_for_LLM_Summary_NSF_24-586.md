# Evaluation of Dissertation Relevance to NSF 24-586: National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds Program

## 1. Introduction

The dissertation titled "Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Mitochondrial Function" explores the innovative integration of neural network principles with mitochondrial biology, aiming to establish a theoretical framework known as the **Shifted Domain**. The research questions focus on understanding how mitochondrial networks adapt to cellular energy demands, the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial plasticity, and the influence of mitochondrial dynamics on cellular signaling and decision-making processes. 

Overall, while the dissertation presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that may have significant implications for cellular biology and therapeutic strategies, it does not align with the objectives of the NSF 24-586 solicitation, which emphasizes the development of quantum technologies and their practical applications. The primary mission of the NSF is to advance fundamental science and technology that can lead to real-world applications, particularly within the quantum realm. Given that this dissertation is centered on biological systems rather than quantum science, it is not relevant to the NSF's Quantum Testbeds program.

## 2. Relevance to Grant

The NSF 24-586 solicitation seeks to advance quantum technologies through scientific and engineering projects, specifically in the Design and Implementation phases of Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD). The core focus areas include:

- Developing enabling technologies that provide practical solutions to real-world problems.
- Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration among academia, industry, and government.
- Demonstrating a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage.

### Assessment of Relevance

1. **Alignment with Focus Areas**: The dissertation's primary focus on mitochondrial function and neural networks does not intersect with quantum technologies. The NSF program aims to facilitate advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and related fields, none of which are addressed in the dissertation. For example, the grant emphasizes the importance of demonstrating a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage, while the dissertation does not engage with quantum concepts or technologies.

2. **Specific Examples**: The dissertation discusses mitochondrial networks and their adaptive behaviors, stating, "Mitochondria function as interconnected networks that adapt to cellular energy needs." However, this statement does not provide any connection to quantum technologies or applications. The NSF grant, on the other hand, specifically invites proposals that can demonstrate practical applications of quantum science, which is absent in this research.

3. **Quantitative Measures**: The alignment of research with NSF's objectives can be assessed through relevance percentiles. Given that the dissertation does not address quantum science or technology, it would fall below the threshold of relevance for this grant, likely scoring in the lower percentiles (0-10%) when evaluated against the program's criteria.

In conclusion, this dissertation does not align with the NSF 24-586 program's objectives, as it focuses on biological systems rather than quantum technologies.

The research states, "The proposed Shifted Domain opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies," which does not align with the NSF's focus on quantum advancements.

### Strongly Negative Perspective
- **Irrelevance to Quantum Science**: The fundamental premise of the dissertation does not engage with quantum principles. The NSF grant specifically seeks proposals that demonstrate a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage, which is entirely absent from the dissertation's focus on mitochondrial dynamics.

### Summary of Rationale
The feedback from these perspectives illustrates a range of opinions on the dissertation's strengths and weaknesses. However, the overarching conclusion remains that the work is not relevant to the NSF 24-586 grant objectives, as it does not address quantum science or technology.

## 4. Contribution to the Field

The dissertation contributes significantly to the field of cellular biology by proposing an innovative theoretical framework that integrates principles from neural networks into mitochondrial function. This interdisciplinary approach fosters new hypotheses and experimental designs, which can advance our understanding of cellular metabolism and resilience. 

### Comparison with Grant Focus Areas
The NSF 24-586 grant emphasizes the development of quantum technologies that can provide practical solutions to real-world problems. In contrast, the dissertation states, "The proposed Shifted Domain not only redefines our understanding of mitochondrial function but also opens avenues for novel therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction." While this contribution is valuable within the context of biological research, it does not align with the grant's focus on quantum advancements.

### Juxtaposition of Quotes
- **Dissertation**: "By drawing parallels between the adaptive and integrative functions of neural networks and the dynamic behavior of mitochondrial networks, we can gain novel insights into cellular metabolism and resilience."
- **Grant Summary**: "The NQVL aims to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, ultimately enhancing the United States' leadership in quantum science and technology."

The juxtaposition highlights the disparity between the dissertation's focus on cellular biology and the grant's emphasis on quantum technology development.

### Evaluation of Methodology
The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, which includes in vitro studies, computational modeling, and systems biology approaches. While this methodology is rigorous for biological research, it does not adhere to the NSF's requirements for quantum technology projects. The NSF expects proposals to demonstrate readiness for system integration and a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage, which the dissertation does not address.

### Data Analysis Techniques
The data analysis techniques used in the dissertation include statistical methods such as descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA). However, these techniques are not relevant to the evaluation of quantum technologies, which would require specialized methodologies tailored to quantum experiments and data analysis.

### Limitations
The dissertation acknowledges limitations, stating, "Ethical considerations are paramount in conducting research involving human and animal subjects." While ethical considerations are essential, the lack of relevance to quantum science remains a significant limitation in the context of the NSF grant.
