## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Buckminster Fuller’s Contributions to Design, Architecture, and Sustainability

Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was an American architect, designer, and futurist known for his innovative ideas on sustainability and design. His work emphasized the importance of efficiency and resource management, concepts that are integral to the idea of "ephemeralization," which refers to the ability to do more with less. Fuller’s geodesic domes and Dymaxion designs exemplified his holistic approach to architecture, which sought to harmonize human needs with environmental sustainability.

Fuller’s influence extends beyond architecture; his ideas have permeated various fields, including urban planning, engineering, and environmental science. His emphasis on systems thinking—the understanding that components of a system are interconnected and interdependent—provides a valuable framework for rethinking culinary practices in light of sustainability.

#### Examination of Culinary Traditions, Their Evolution, and the Impact of Globalization on Cuisine

Culinary traditions have evolved significantly over time, influenced by cultural exchanges, technological advancements, and globalization. The global food system has become increasingly interconnected, leading to the widespread availability of diverse ingredients and cooking techniques. However, this globalization has also resulted in challenges such as the homogenization of culinary practices and the marginalization of local food cultures.

Understanding the historical context of culinary evolution is essential for recognizing the potential for integrating Fuller’s principles into modern cuisine. By examining the impact of globalization on culinary traditions, this dissertation will highlight the importance of preserving local food systems while embracing innovative practices that promote sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Culinary Practices, Including Sustainability Efforts and Technological Innovations

Contemporary culinary practices are increasingly focused on sustainability, with many chefs and restaurants adopting practices that prioritize local sourcing, seasonal ingredients, and waste reduction. The rise of farm-to-table movements and the popularity of plant-based diets reflect a growing awareness of the environmental impact of food choices.

Technological innovations, such as precision agriculture, vertical farming, and molecular gastronomy, are also reshaping the culinary landscape. These advancements offer new opportunities for enhancing flavor, reducing waste, and improving resource efficiency. However, there is a need for further research on how these technologies can be integrated with holistic and sustainable culinary practices.

#### Review of Existing Literature on Systems Thinking and Its Applications in Various Fields

Systems thinking has been widely studied in fields such as environmental science, sociology, and organizational management. However, its application in the culinary arts remains underexplored. Existing literature highlights the importance of understanding food systems as interconnected wholes, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address complex challenges.

This dissertation will contribute to the growing body of literature on systems thinking by applying these concepts to the culinary domain, providing a framework for understanding the interconnectedness of food systems and culinary practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research That Combines Culinary Arts with Systems Thinking

Despite the increasing interest in sustainability within the culinary arts, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that combines culinary practices with systems thinking. This gap presents an opportunity to explore how Fuller's principles can inform and transform culinary practices, fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of food systems.

#### Exploration of the Potential for New Culinary Practices That Embrace Sustainability and Innovation

The Shifted Domain offers a unique opportunity to explore new culinary practices that embrace sustainability and innovation. By integrating Fuller's concepts into culinary education and practice, this research aims to inspire chefs and culinary professionals to adopt more sustainable approaches, ultimately contributing to a more resilient food system.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Holistic Thinking

Holistic thinking emphasizes the importance of understanding systems as interconnected wholes rather than isolated components. In the context of culinary practices, this perspective encourages chefs to consider the broader implications of their food choices, including environmental, social, and cultural factors. This approach can be visualized through a systems map that illustrates the relationships among ingredients, techniques, and cultural narratives.

#### Sustainability

Sustainability is a foundational principle that seeks to balance human needs with environmental stewardship. In the culinary arts, sustainability encompasses practices such as local sourcing, waste reduction, and ethical treatment of food producers. By applying sustainable principles to culinary practices, chefs can contribute to a more equitable and environmentally responsible food system.

#### Tensegrity

Tensegrity, a concept popularized by Fuller, refers to the structural integrity of a system achieved through the balance of tension and compression. In culinary practices, tensegrity can be applied to the relationships between ingredients, techniques, and cultural narratives, emphasizing the importance of balance and harmony in creating innovative dishes. This can be represented in a table that categorizes various culinary elements and their interdependencies.

#### Synergetics

Synergetics, another key concept from Fuller, focuses on the emergence of complex patterns from simple interactions. In the culinary arts, synergetics can be applied to flavor interactions, where the combination of diverse ingredients and techniques leads to unique and unexpected flavor profiles. This emergent property can be illustrated through a diagram that maps flavor interactions and their resultant complexities.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Synergetics Model

The Culinary Synergetics Model is a proposed framework that integrates Fuller's principles with culinary practices. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of ingredients, techniques, and cultural narratives, promoting a holistic approach to culinary innovation. A visual representation can be created to illustrate the model's components and their interactions.

#### Spaceship Kitchen Philosophy

The Spaceship Kitchen philosophy draws inspiration from Fuller's vision of a sustainable future. This philosophy encourages chefs to view their kitchens as microcosms of sustainable ecosystems, where resource efficiency, waste reduction, and innovative practices are prioritized. An infographic can be developed to depict the principles of the Spaceship Kitchen and their applications in culinary settings.

#### Sustainable Culinary Design

Sustainable culinary design encompasses the principles of sustainability and holistic thinking in the creation of culinary spaces and practices. This construct emphasizes the importance of designing kitchens, menus, and dining experiences that prioritize environmental stewardship and social equity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines Fuller's principles with culinary practices, emphasizing the interconnectedness of food systems, sustainability, and innovation. This model serves as a framework for exploring the implications of these principles in contemporary culinary practices, ultimately providing a roadmap for chefs and culinary professionals seeking to adopt more sustainable approaches.
