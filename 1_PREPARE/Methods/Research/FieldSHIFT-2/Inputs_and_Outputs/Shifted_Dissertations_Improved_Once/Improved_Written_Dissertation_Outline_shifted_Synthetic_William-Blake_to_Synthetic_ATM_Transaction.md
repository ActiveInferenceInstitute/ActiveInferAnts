## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work is characterized by its visionary quality and profound social critique. His artistic philosophy emphasized the power of imagination as a means of transcending the limitations of reason and societal constraints. Blake's belief in the duality of existence—where opposites coexist and inform each other—can be seen in his exploration of themes such as innocence and experience, heaven and hell, and the material versus the spiritual. His works, such as *Songs of Innocence and of Experience*, reflect a deep concern for social justice and the human condition, making his insights relevant to contemporary discussions of equity and access in financial systems.

#### ATM Transactions

The Automated Teller Machine (ATM) has evolved significantly since its introduction in the late 1960s. Initially designed as a tool for dispensing cash, ATMs now offer a wide range of banking services, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. Technological advancements, such as touch screens and mobile integration, have transformed user interactions with these machines. However, despite these innovations, ATMs often remain underutilized as platforms for user engagement and education. This section will trace the evolution of ATMs, highlighting key technological advancements and shifts in user interaction paradigms.

| Year     | Key ATM Development        | User Interaction Shift                                |
|----------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1967     | First ATM introduced       | Basic cash withdrawal                                 |
| 1980s    | Introduction of deposits    | Expanded functionalities                              |
| 2000s    | Touch screen technology    | Enhanced user interface and experience                |
| 2010s    | Mobile integration         | Shift towards multi-functional platforms              |

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent research in user experience (UX) design emphasizes the importance of creating interfaces that are intuitive, engaging, and accessible. Studies show that users often feel disconnected from traditional banking systems, leading to lower engagement rates and financial literacy. On the other hand, artistic influences in technology design have gained traction, with scholars advocating for the integration of creativity and social responsibility into technological solutions. This section will analyze existing literature on user experience in banking technology and the role of artistic influences in design, identifying areas where these fields intersect and potential pathways for innovation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing body of research on user experience and artistic design, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary approaches to ATM design. Current ATM interfaces often lack the imaginative and socially responsible elements that could enhance user satisfaction and accessibility. This section will identify specific opportunities for integrating Blake's artistic principles into the design of ATMs, paving the way for innovative solutions that prioritize user engagement and community impact.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Imagination vs. Reason

Cognitive theories of user experience emphasize the role of imagination in enhancing creativity and problem-solving. Blake's philosophy posits that imagination transcends mere reason, allowing individuals to engage with their environment in a more profound and meaningful way. This section will explore how these theories can inform the design of ATM interfaces that prioritize creativity and personalization.

#### Contraries

Blake's notion of contraries—where opposites coexist and inform each other—can be applied to user interaction and design. This section will discuss theories of duality in design, exploring how contrasting elements can enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of artistic philosophy with user-centered design principles leads to the emergence of new theoretical constructs. This section will propose conceptual frameworks that synthesize Blake's principles with contemporary design thinking, creating a holistic approach to ATM functionality that prioritizes user experience and community engagement.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
