## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of Chemistry from alchemy to a systematic science has shaped our understanding of matter and interactions. Early chemists, influenced by philosophical concepts, engaged in practices that laid the groundwork for modern chemistry. The transition to a scientific discipline marked a shift towards empirical methods and quantitative analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of chemical processes.

Meanwhile, Game Design has transitioned from simple mechanics, seen in early board games and arcade machines, to complex systems that engage players on multiple levels. The introduction of digital technology has allowed for the development of intricate narratives and immersive environments, pushing the boundaries of player interaction and engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current trends in Chemistry emphasize sustainability, computational methods, and interdisciplinary collaborations. The rise of green chemistry and the application of machine learning in chemical research highlight the discipline's adaptability to modern challenges. Conversely, Game Design focuses on player engagement, narrative depth, and ethical monetization. The gaming industry has evolved to prioritize user experience, with an increasing emphasis on inclusivity and social impact.

However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges these domains. Despite the potential for innovative educational tools and enhanced player experiences, the integration of scientific principles into game design has not been thoroughly explored. 

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The absence of a framework that integrates scientific principles into game design presents a unique opportunity for innovation. This dissertation aims to fill this gap, providing a structured approach to applying Chemistry concepts in Game Design.
