## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Development of Chemistry as a Discipline

Chemistry, often referred to as the "central science," has evolved significantly since its inception in ancient alchemy. The transition from alchemical practices to modern chemistry was marked by key developments in understanding the nature of matter, including the formulation of the atomic theory by John Dalton in the early 19th century and the establishment of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev. These milestones laid the groundwork for a systematic exploration of chemical properties and interactions, ultimately leading to advancements in fields such as biochemistry, organic chemistry, and materials science.

#### Examination of the Evolution of Non-Science Ways of Knowing

Non-science ways of knowing encompass a broad spectrum of knowledge systems, including indigenous knowledge, artistic expression, and philosophical reasoning. Indigenous knowledge systems, for instance, are rooted in the experiential understanding of the environment, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings. Similarly, artistic expression offers insights into the human condition, capturing emotional and cultural nuances that often elude scientific quantification. The evolution of these knowledge systems highlights the richness of human experience and the necessity of integrating diverse perspectives in our understanding of the world.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Summary of Recent Advancements in Chemistry

Recent advancements in chemistry, particularly in fields such as nanotechnology and green chemistry, have profound implications for understanding matter and energy. The development of nanomaterials has opened new avenues for applications in medicine, electronics, and environmental remediation, while green chemistry emphasizes the importance of sustainability and environmental responsibility in chemical practices. These advancements not only enhance our understanding of chemical interactions but also underscore the ethical considerations that accompany scientific progress.

#### Exploration of Contemporary Discussions Surrounding Non-Scientific Knowledge

Contemporary discussions surrounding non-scientific knowledge focus on its validity and role in society. Scholars argue for the recognition of indigenous knowledge systems as legitimate forms of understanding that can inform scientific inquiry and policy-making. Additionally, the rise of interdisciplinary studies has prompted a reevaluation of the boundaries between scientific and non-scientific knowledge, advocating for a more inclusive approach that values diverse epistemologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
