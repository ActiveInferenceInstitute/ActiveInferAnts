## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemistry

The evolution of chemistry from alchemy to modern chemistry is a narrative marked by significant milestones and key figures. Alchemy, often regarded as a precursor to modern chemistry, was steeped in mystical and philosophical traditions. The transition to empirical methods began in the 17th century with figures like Robert Boyle, who emphasized experimentation and the scientific method. The development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev and the formulation of atomic theory by John Dalton further solidified chemistry as a rigorous scientific discipline. This historical context sets the stage for understanding the empirical foundations of chemistry and its methodologies.

#### Non-Science Ways of Knowing

Non-science ways of knowing encompass a broad spectrum of cultural, spiritual, and experiential knowledge systems. Indigenous knowledge, for instance, has long been recognized for its holistic understanding of the environment and human relationships. The historical development of these knowledge systems reflects a rich tapestry of human experience, often rooted in storytelling, tradition, and communal practices. This section will examine the philosophical underpinnings of these knowledge systems, including constructivism, which posits that knowledge is constructed through social interactions and experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemistry

Current trends in chemistry include the rise of green chemistry, which emphasizes sustainability and the reduction of hazardous substances, and the increasing use of computational methods to model chemical processes. These advancements reflect a growing awareness of the environmental and societal implications of chemical research, underscoring the need for a more integrated approach that considers both empirical evidence and societal context.

#### Non-Science Ways of Knowing

The current paradigms in non-science ways of knowing face challenges such as marginalization and a lack of recognition within formal educational systems. However, there is a growing movement to validate these knowledge systems, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability and community resilience. This section will explore innovative approaches that seek to integrate non-scientific knowledge into contemporary discourse, highlighting the potential for synergy between these domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich histories and current developments in both chemistry and non-science ways of knowing, there exists a notable gap in the literature regarding their integration. This dissertation seeks to identify these gaps and explore opportunities for innovative research that bridges empirical and intuitive knowledge. By examining the intersections between these domains, this research aims to contribute to a more holistic understanding of knowledge that transcends disciplinary boundaries.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Chemistry

Key theories in chemistry, such as molecular orbital theory and thermodynamics, provide a robust framework for understanding chemical processes. Molecular orbital theory, for instance, explains the behavior of electrons in molecules and their impact on chemical bonding. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, addresses the principles governing energy transfer and transformation in chemical reactions. These foundational theories will serve as a basis for exploring their applications in non-science ways of knowing.

#### Non-Science Knowledge Systems

The philosophical underpinnings of non-science knowledge, particularly constructivism and indigenous knowledge systems, emphasize the importance of context and experience in shaping understanding. Constructivism posits that knowledge is not merely transmitted but actively constructed through social interactions. Indigenous knowledge systems, often grounded in centuries of lived experience, offer valuable insights into sustainable practices and community resilience. This section will explore how these theoretical foundations can inform the integration of empirical and experiential knowledge.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

As the dissertation seeks to bridge the domains of chemistry and non-science ways of knowing, it introduces new theoretical constructs such as "Experiential Catalysts" and "Intuitive Kinetics." "Experiential Catalysts" refer to the factors that facilitate personal and communal transformation through lived experiences, while "Intuitive Kinetics" seeks to model decision-making processes using principles derived from chemical kinetics. These constructs will be further developed and integrated into the proposed theoretical model.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

To visually represent the interconnections between chemistry and non-science ways of knowing, this section will present a theoretical model illustrating how these domains inform and enhance each other. This model will serve as a foundational tool for understanding the complex interplay between empirical evidence and intuitive knowledge, providing a framework for further exploration and analysis.
