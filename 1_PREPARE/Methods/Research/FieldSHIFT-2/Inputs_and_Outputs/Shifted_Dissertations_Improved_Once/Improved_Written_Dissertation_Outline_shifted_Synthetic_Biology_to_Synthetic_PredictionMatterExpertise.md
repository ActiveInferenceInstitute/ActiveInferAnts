## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Studies

Ecosystem science has evolved significantly over the past few decades, shifting from a focus on individual species and habitats to a more holistic understanding of interdependence, biodiversity, and resilience. Pioneering work by ecologists such as Eugene Odum and Robert Paine laid the foundation for understanding ecosystems as complex, adaptive systems. Key developments include the recognition of trophic dynamics, the role of keystone species, and the importance of ecological resilience in maintaining ecosystem functions. The transition from reductionist approaches to systems thinking in ecology has illuminated the interconnectedness of organisms and their environments, offering valuable insights for organizational decision-making.

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

The evolution of PME has been shaped by advancements in data analytics, behavioral science, and decision theory. Early frameworks emphasized the role of expert judgment and statistical modeling in decision-making. However, contemporary PME integrates insights from diverse disciplines, including cognitive psychology, systems thinking, and machine learning, to enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability. This evolution reflects the increasing complexity of decision-making environments and the need for organizations to adapt rapidly to changing circumstances. The integration of behavioral insights into predictive modeling has led to more nuanced understandings of human decision-making processes, highlighting the importance of context and social dynamics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Ecosystem Studies

Contemporary research in ecosystem science emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and resilience as critical factors in ecosystem health. Studies have demonstrated that ecosystems with high biodiversity are more resilient to disturbances and are better able to provide essential services, such as carbon sequestration and water purification. Methodological advancements, including remote sensing and ecological modeling, have further enhanced our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. These advancements not only contribute to ecological knowledge but also offer frameworks that can be applied to organizational contexts, emphasizing the need for adaptive management practices.

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

Current trends in PME highlight the integration of big data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in predictive modeling. However, challenges remain, including biases in data interpretation, the complexity of human decision-making, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Innovations in predictive analytics are increasingly focused on enhancing the interpretability and usability of models, allowing organizations to make informed decisions in real time. The interplay between data-driven insights and human intuition presents opportunities for more effective decision-making processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remain significant gaps in the literature regarding the application of ecological principles to PME. Few studies have systematically explored how concepts such as biodiversity and resilience can inform predictive frameworks, leaving a rich area for interdisciplinary research. This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by exploring the potential for integrating insights from ecosystem science into PME practices, thereby fostering a more adaptive and resilient decision-making culture.
