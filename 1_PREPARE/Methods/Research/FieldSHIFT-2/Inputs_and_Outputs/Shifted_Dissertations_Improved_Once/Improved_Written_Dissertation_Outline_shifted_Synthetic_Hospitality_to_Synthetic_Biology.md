# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Guest Experience into Ecosystem Management

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and ecosystem management practices. By transposing core elements of personalization, service delivery, technology integration, and sustainability from Domain A (Guest Experience) into Domain B (Ecosystems), this research develops new frameworks and models that enhance biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize conservation strategies, promote sustainable practices, and foster a deeper connection between humans and nature. 

Through rigorous analysis and interdisciplinary exploration, this dissertation seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of how the integration of these domains can lead to transformative outcomes for both ecological and human systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalized service, technological integration, and sustainable practices. This sector recognizes that customer satisfaction is paramount, leading to an evolution of service models that prioritize individual preferences and needs. Conversely, ecosystem management has traditionally centered on biodiversity conservation and ecological balance, often employing a top-down approach that overlooks the role of human experiences and interactions with the environment. This dissertation will explore how the principles of guest experience can inform and transform ecosystem management, creating a new paradigm for both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to merging two distinct domains, creating a framework that not only addresses ecological challenges but also emphasizes human engagement and satisfaction. By applying guest experience principles to ecosystems, we can develop tailored conservation strategies that resonate with local communities and stakeholders, ultimately leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes. The integration of these domains holds the potential to foster a more profound appreciation for biodiversity, thereby enhancing advocacy for conservation efforts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of guest experience be effectively transposed into ecosystem management?
2. What are the potential benefits of personalized ecosystem management strategies on biodiversity conservation?
3. How can technology enhance the monitoring and management of ecosystems in a manner similar to guest experience technologies in hospitality?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Domain A: Guest Experience

The evolution of guest experience theories and practices in hospitality can be traced back to the early 20th century, with pioneers like Conrad Hilton and J.W. Marriott emphasizing the importance of customer satisfaction. Theoretical frameworks such as the Service Quality Model (SERVQUAL) and the Experience Economy have since emerged, focusing on how personalized services and emotional connections enhance guest satisfaction. These frameworks underscore the significance of understanding consumer behavior, preferences, and the overall guest journey. 

#### Domain B: Ecosystems

The historical development of ecological theories and conservation practices has its roots in the works of early naturalists and ecologists, such as Charles Darwin and Aldo Leopold. The establishment of the field of ecology in the late 19th century marked a shift towards understanding the interconnectedness of species and their environments. Over time, conservation strategies evolved from preservationist approaches to more integrative models that consider human impacts, leading to the contemporary focus on ecosystem services and resilience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in guest experience management highlight the growing importance of technology and data analytics in understanding customer preferences. Techniques such as sentiment analysis and personalized marketing have transformed how hospitality businesses engage with their guests. In parallel, ecological resilience strategies have gained traction, emphasizing adaptive management and stakeholder involvement in conservation practices. The integration of technology in both fields, particularly through the use of big data and remote sensing, has opened new avenues for enhancing service delivery and ecosystem monitoring.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary approaches that connect guest experience with ecosystem management. Most existing literature tends to compartmentalize these domains, missing the opportunity to leverage insights from one to inform the other. This dissertation seeks to explore these gaps and identify innovative frameworks that enhance both guest satisfaction and ecosystem health, thereby contributing to a more holistic understanding of human-environment interactions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Guest Experience Theory

Guest experience theory encompasses a range of concepts that focus on enhancing customer satisfaction through personalized service, emotional engagement, and memorable interactions. The Experience Economy framework posits that businesses must create experiences that engage customers on multiple levels—cognitive, emotional, and sensory—to foster loyalty and satisfaction.

#### Ecological Theory

Ecological theory, particularly resilience and biodiversity frameworks, emphasizes the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while maintaining their essential functions. The concept of ecosystem services further expands this understanding by categorizing the benefits that humans derive from natural systems, including provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Personalized Ecosystem Management

Personalized ecosystem management draws parallels between the customization of guest experiences and the tailoring of conservation strategies to meet the specific needs of local communities and stakeholders. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding individual and collective values in fostering sustainable practices.

#### Ecological Service Delivery Model

The Ecological Service Delivery Model adapts service delivery principles from hospitality to the management of ecosystem services. It proposes a framework for delivering ecological benefits in a manner that is responsive to user needs and preferences, thereby enhancing the perceived value of conservation efforts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The "Ecosystem Experience Model" will be developed to illustrate the parallels between guest interactions and species interactions within ecosystems. This model will serve as a conceptual framework for understanding how personalized approaches can enhance both human experiences and ecological outcomes.
