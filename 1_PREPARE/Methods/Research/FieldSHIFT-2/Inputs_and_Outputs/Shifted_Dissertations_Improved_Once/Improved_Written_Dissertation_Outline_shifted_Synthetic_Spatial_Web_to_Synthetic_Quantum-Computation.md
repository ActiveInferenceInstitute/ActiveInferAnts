## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Spatial Web

The evolution of the Spatial Web can be traced through the advancements in AR, VR, and IoT technologies. AR and VR have transitioned from niche applications to mainstream technologies, with applications ranging from gaming and entertainment to education and healthcare. IoT has further enhanced the Spatial Web by enabling interconnected devices to communicate and share data, creating a more immersive and responsive environment. Key milestones include the development of ARtoolkit in the early 2000s, the rise of consumer VR headsets like Oculus Rift, and the proliferation of smart devices that contribute to a connected ecosystem.

#### Quantum Computation

The development of quantum computation is grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics, with historical milestones including the formulation of quantum theory in the early 20th century, the introduction of quantum algorithms by Peter Shor in 1994, and the advent of quantum hardware in the 21st century. Quantum computation offers a fundamentally different approach to problem-solving, leveraging quantum bits (qubits) that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This capability enables quantum computers to tackle problems that are intractable for classical computers, such as factoring large integers and simulating quantum systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Currently, the Spatial Web has seen significant advancements in applications such as virtual tours, immersive training simulations, and interactive data visualizations. In quantum computation, notable progress includes the development of quantum algorithms, error correction techniques, and the construction of quantum processors. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary initiatives that explore the intersection of these fields, highlighting an opportunity for innovation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a gap in frameworks that combine spatial awareness with quantum computational processes. While immersive technologies have been applied in various domains, their potential to enhance quantum education and application remains largely unexplored. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing methodologies that integrate spatial computing with quantum mechanics, fostering a deeper understanding of quantum concepts.

## Theoretical Framework

Theories of interactivity emphasize the importance of user engagement and contextual awareness in digital environments. Key concepts include the user experience (UX) design principles that prioritize intuitive interactions and the integration of real-time data to enhance situational awareness. Theories of data integration focus on the seamless merging of physical and digital data streams, enabling users to interact with information in a spatially aware manner.

#### Quantum Mechanics Principles

Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, form the foundation of quantum computation. Superposition allows qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement enables correlations between qubits regardless of distance. Quantum gates manipulate qubits to perform computations, fundamentally differing from classical logic gates.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Quantum Spatial Awareness

The concept of "Quantum Spatial Awareness" emerges as a new paradigm for understanding quantum systems in spatial contexts. This construct emphasizes the importance of spatial representation in visualizing and manipulating quantum states, facilitating a more intuitive grasp of complex quantum phenomena. For instance, how might different spatial representations impact our cognitive understanding of entangled states?

#### Contextual Adaptation Theories in Quantum Algorithms

Contextual adaptation theories propose that quantum algorithms can be optimized by incorporating contextual awareness, allowing them to operate more efficiently in real-time environments. This approach leverages the dynamic nature of the Spatial Web to enhance the performance of quantum computations.
