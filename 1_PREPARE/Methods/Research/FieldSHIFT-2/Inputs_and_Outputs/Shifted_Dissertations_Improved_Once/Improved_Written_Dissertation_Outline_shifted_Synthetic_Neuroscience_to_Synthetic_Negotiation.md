# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved from philosophical inquiries about the mind to a rigorous scientific discipline that integrates psychology, biology, and technology. Key advancements include the development of neuroimaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG), which allow researchers to observe brain activity in real-time. Additionally, the exploration of brain plasticity has illuminated how experiences and learning can reshape neural connections, underscoring the brain's adaptability throughout life.

### Negotiation

Negotiation has transitioned from simple exchanges to complex interactions involving multiple stakeholders, with an increasing emphasis on integrative strategies. The field has seen a shift towards understanding the psychological and emotional dimensions of negotiation, moving beyond mere transactional approaches. Scholars have increasingly focused on the role of trust, empathy, and cultural differences in shaping negotiation outcomes, recognizing that successful negotiations often hinge on the ability to navigate interpersonal relationships.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Neuroscience

Current research in neuroscience explores a variety of topics, including brain-computer interfaces, the role of the microbiome in brain health, and neuroplasticity's impact on rehabilitation. These advancements provide a deeper understanding of how neural processes affect behavior and cognition. For instance, studies have shown that certain neural pathways are activated during decision-making processes, highlighting the intricate relationship between brain function and behavioral outcomes.

### Negotiation

Negotiation research focuses on psychological tactics, cultural differences, and emotional dynamics. However, there is a lack of exploration into the underlying cognitive processes that influence negotiation outcomes. While existing literature emphasizes the importance of strategic planning and communication skills, there is a growing recognition of the need to incorporate insights from neuroscience to develop a more comprehensive understanding of negotiation dynamics.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Neuroscience

- **Neural Networks**: Understanding how interconnected neurons process information is fundamental to grasping how decisions are made and actions are taken. Neural networks facilitate the communication between various brain regions, allowing for the integration of sensory information and the execution of complex behaviors.
  
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: The ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken in response to increases or decreases in their activity is crucial for learning and adaptability. This concept underlies the notion that experiences can lead to lasting changes in behavior and cognitive function.

### Negotiation

- **Game Theory**: Models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers provide a mathematical framework for analyzing negotiation scenarios. Game theory emphasizes the importance of anticipating the actions of others and making decisions that maximize one's own payoff while considering the potential responses of counterparts.
  
- **Emotional Intelligence**: The ability to recognize and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others is vital for successful negotiation. Emotional intelligence encompasses skills such as empathy, self-regulation, and social awareness, which can significantly influence negotiation outcomes.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Neuroadaptive Negotiation**: A framework that combines neural adaptability with negotiation strategies, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and responsiveness in negotiation contexts. This construct posits that negotiators who can adapt their strategies based on real-time feedback from their counterparts are more likely to achieve successful outcomes.
