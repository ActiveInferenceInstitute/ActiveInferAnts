## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience
Neuroscience has undergone significant developments over the past century, evolving from the study of individual neurons to a comprehensive understanding of complex neural networks. Key concepts such as synaptic plasticity—the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time—have profound implications for learning and behavior. Neurotransmitters, chemicals that transmit signals across synapses, play a crucial role in regulating mood, motivation, and cognitive functions, all of which are essential for effective negotiation.

#### Negotiation
The study of negotiation has evolved through various paradigms, from distributive bargaining to integrative negotiation strategies. Early theories focused on competitive approaches, while contemporary practices emphasize collaboration and mutual gain. Key figures such as Fisher and Ury (1981) introduced principled negotiation, which advocates for separating people from the problem and focusing on interests rather than positions. This historical context sets the stage for the integration of neuroscience into negotiation strategies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent advancements in neuroscience, particularly in understanding brain functions related to decision-making and emotional regulation, have significant implications for human behavior. The exploration of neural correlates of emotions and cognitive processes provides insights into how individuals navigate complex social interactions, including negotiation. In negotiation studies, however, there remains a gap in addressing the cognitive and emotional influences on negotiation outcomes. Current theories often overlook the biological underpinnings of these processes, creating an opportunity for interdisciplinary exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of neuroscience with negotiation is largely unexplored, with few empirical studies linking the two fields. This gap presents a unique opportunity to develop new frameworks and methodologies that incorporate neural insights into negotiation strategies. By addressing this gap, this research aims to contribute to the understanding of how cognitive and emotional factors, informed by neuroscience, can enhance negotiation effectiveness.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience
Foundational theories in neuroscience, such as Hebbian theory, emphasize the importance of synaptic strength and connectivity in learning and behavior. Network theory further elucidates how interactions among neurons create complex behaviors, which can be analogously applied to negotiation dynamics. Understanding these theories provides a basis for exploring how neural processes influence negotiation strategies.

#### Negotiation
Key negotiation theories, including game theory and integrative negotiation, provide frameworks for analyzing decision-making processes in competitive and collaborative contexts. Game theory, with its focus on strategic interactions, offers insights into how negotiators can anticipate and respond to the actions of others. Integrative negotiation emphasizes cooperation and mutual benefit, aligning with the principles of emotional intelligence and empathy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This research introduces concepts such as "Negotiation Networks" and "Adaptive Negotiation." Negotiation Networks conceptualize negotiation as a dynamic web of relationships influenced by cognitive and emotional factors. Adaptive Negotiation emphasizes the ability of negotiators to adjust their strategies based on real-time feedback and emotional cues. Additionally, the constructs of emotional modulation and skill neurogenesis are explored, highlighting the potential for negotiators to develop emotional intelligence and negotiation skills over time.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between neural processes and negotiation strategies. This model posits that understanding the neural underpinnings of decision-making and emotional regulation can enhance negotiation effectiveness. By incorporating insights from neuroscience into negotiation training and practice, negotiators can develop adaptive strategies that lead to better outcomes.

#### Hypotheses
1. **H1:** Higher levels of emotional intelligence are positively correlated with improved negotiation outcomes.
2. **H2:** The application of adaptive negotiation strategies leads to higher satisfaction levels among negotiating parties.
3. **H3:** Training programs incorporating neuroscience principles will result in enhanced negotiation skills over time.
