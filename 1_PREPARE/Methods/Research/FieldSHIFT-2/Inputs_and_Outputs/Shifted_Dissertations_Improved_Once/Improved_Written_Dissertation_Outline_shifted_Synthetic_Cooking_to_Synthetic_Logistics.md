## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary practices is a narrative rich with cultural exchanges and technological advancements. From communal cooking in ancient societies to the rise of haute cuisine, culinary practices have been shaped by geography, culture, and innovation. The advent of globalization has further diversified culinary expressions, leading to a fusion of flavors and techniques that reflect a broader cultural narrative. The study of cuisine encompasses not only the preparation and presentation of food but also the sensory experiences associated with it, including taste, aroma, and visual appeal, all of which play crucial roles in customer satisfaction. 

#### Logistics

The historical development of logistics can be traced back to ancient civilizations that employed rudimentary transportation systems for trade. Over centuries, logistics evolved from simple transportation to complex global supply chains, driven by technological advancements and the demands of a global economy. The modern logistics landscape is characterized by its focus on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer service. However, the field faces numerous challenges, including last-mile delivery issues, supply chain disruptions, and the urgent need for sustainable practices. 

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Culinary Trends

Contemporary culinary trends emphasize sustainability, health, and the use of local ingredients. The farm-to-table movement, for instance, reflects a growing consumer preference for transparency in food sourcing and preparation. Additionally, culinary innovation is increasingly driven by technology, with advancements in food science and preservation techniques reshaping how food is prepared and distributed. 

#### Logistics Challenges

Current logistics challenges include the complexities of last-mile delivery, which account for a significant portion of logistics costs, and the need for supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions such as natural disasters or global pandemics. The logistics industry is also under pressure to adopt sustainable practices, responding to consumer demand for environmentally friendly operations. 

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich histories and current challenges in both cuisine and logistics, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that leverage culinary concepts within logistics practices. This research identifies the potential for culinary principles to fill these gaps, enhancing operational practices and customer engagement in logistics. By exploring this intersection, the dissertation aims to provide insights that can lead to more innovative and effective logistical strategies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theories

Culinary theories focus on sensory experiences, cultural narratives, and preparation techniques. The concept of "mise en place," which translates to "everything in its place," emphasizes the importance of organization and preparation in achieving culinary excellence. This principle can be applied to logistics to enhance operational efficiency and reduce errors. 

#### Logistics Theories

Logistics theories emphasize supply chain management, optimization, and customer service. Traditional logistics models often prioritize cost minimization and efficiency, but they may overlook the importance of customer experience and responsiveness. By integrating culinary principles, this research seeks to create a more holistic approach to logistics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs such as "Logistics Mise en Place" and "Customer Flavor Profiles." "Logistics Mise en Place" refers to the organizational strategies derived from culinary practices that can enhance logistical efficiency. "Customer Flavor Profiles" encapsulate the preferences and expectations of customers, allowing logistics providers to tailor their services accordingly.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model is proposed to illustrate the interaction between culinary principles and logistics practices. This model highlights the potential for enhanced efficiency and customer satisfaction through the application of culinary concepts in logistics, emphasizing the importance of preparation, organization, and understanding customer needs.

| **Theoretical Constructs** | **Description** | **Potential Impacts** |
|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Logistics Mise en Place     | Organizational strategies derived from culinary practices | Minimized errors, streamlined processes, enhanced efficiency |
| Customer Flavor Profiles     | Customer preferences and expectations | Tailored services, improved customer satisfaction, increased loyalty |
