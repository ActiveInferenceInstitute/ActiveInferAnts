## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain

The origins of blockchain technology can be traced back to 2008, when an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto introduced it as the underlying technology for Bitcoin. The evolution of blockchain has witnessed key milestones, including the development of Ethereum, which expanded blockchain's capabilities beyond cryptocurrency to smart contracts and decentralized applications. Recent advancements, such as Layer 2 solutions and interoperability protocols, have further enhanced blockchain's applicability across diverse sectors, including hospitality.

#### Guest Experience

Historically, guest experience in hospitality has evolved from a focus on basic service delivery to a more nuanced understanding of customer satisfaction. The integration of technology, such as online booking systems and mobile applications, has enhanced service quality. However, challenges remain in personalizing guest interactions and ensuring data security. The literature indicates a growing demand for innovative solutions that leverage technology to enhance guest experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in blockchain applications have demonstrated its potential to disrupt traditional business models. In the hospitality sector, current trends highlight the need for improved data management, enhanced customer loyalty programs, and streamlined service delivery. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data privacy concerns and the complexity of technology adoption remain prevalent.
