## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the years. Early practices focused primarily on basic service provision, with little attention to the emotional and psychological aspects of guest interactions. As competition intensified, a shift occurred towards enhancing service quality, personalization, and the overall guest experience. Frameworks such as SERVQUAL emerged to evaluate service quality dimensions, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy.

In recent years, the integration of technology into hospitality has further transformed guest experiences. Mobile applications, online booking systems, and personalized marketing strategies have become commonplace, enabling businesses to tailor their offerings to individual preferences and needs. The advent of big data analytics allows hospitality providers to gain insights into guest behavior, leading to more targeted and effective service delivery.

#### Spatial Web Development

The Spatial Web is an emergent concept encompassing a range of technologies, including AR, IoT, and semantic web technologies. Historically, the development of these technologies has been driven by the need for more immersive and interactive user experiences. The introduction of AR has enabled users to overlay digital information onto the physical world, creating new opportunities for engagement and interaction.

The evolution of IoT has facilitated the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data from interconnected devices, allowing for real-time personalization and responsiveness in user experiences. As these technologies advance, they hold the potential to redefine how individuals interact with both physical and digital environments.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current state of knowledge in the hospitality sector emphasizes the importance of personalization and service quality in enhancing guest experiences. Research has shown that personalized services lead to higher levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Frameworks for measuring guest experience have evolved to include metrics that assess emotional responses, engagement levels, and overall satisfaction.

In the realm of the Spatial Web, existing literature has focused on user engagement, technology integration, and digital service quality. Studies have highlighted the potential of AR and IoT to create immersive experiences that enhance user satisfaction. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the integration of hospitality principles into digital environments.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both hospitality and digital technologies, notable gaps exist in the literature regarding the integration of hospitality principles into the Spatial Web. Most existing research has focused on either hospitality or digital technologies in isolation, failing to explore the synergies between the two domains. This presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research that bridges user experience design with technological innovation.

By synthesizing insights from both fields, this dissertation aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances user experiences in digital environments, ultimately contributing to the evolution of both hospitality and digital interaction.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Models

Service quality models, such as SERVQUAL, provide a foundation for understanding how service delivery impacts customer satisfaction. SERVQUAL identifies five dimensions of service quality that can be applied to both hospitality and digital contexts. By adapting these dimensions to the Spatial Web, we can gain insights into how digital interactions can be optimized to enhance user satisfaction.

#### User Experience Design

User experience design principles, including usability, accessibility, and emotional design, are critical for creating engaging digital experiences. These principles emphasize the importance of understanding user needs and preferences, ensuring that digital interactions are intuitive and satisfying. By integrating these principles with hospitality concepts, we can develop a more holistic approach to user experience in digital environments.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Personalized Spatial Experience Theory

The Personalized Spatial Experience Theory proposes that personalization in digital interactions can significantly enhance user satisfaction. This theory suggests that by leveraging data from IoT devices, businesses can create tailored experiences that resonate with individual users. Personalization can take various forms, including customized content, location-based services, and adaptive interfaces that respond to user preferences.

#### Digital Service Quality Framework

The Digital Service Quality Framework is an adaptation of traditional service quality metrics to evaluate digital experiences. This framework incorporates dimensions such as responsiveness, reliability, and empathy, tailored to the unique characteristics of digital interactions. By applying this framework to the Spatial Web, we can assess the effectiveness of digital services in meeting user needs and expectations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model interlinks hospitality guest experience principles with Spatial Web interactions. This model incorporates key elements such as user satisfaction, engagement, and co-creation, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how digital technologies can enhance user experiences. By examining the interplay between these elements, we can identify best practices for optimizing digital interactions in various contexts.
