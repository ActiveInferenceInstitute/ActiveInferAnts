## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges two previously distinct fields: ecology and culinary arts. Ecology, a branch of biological science, focuses on the interdependent relationships within ecosystems, examining how organisms interact with one another and their environments. Conversely, culinary arts emphasize the sensory experiences, cultural significance, and social contexts of food. This dissertation will investigate how ecological concepts can inform and transform culinary practices, creating a dialogue between these fields that is both innovative and necessary in addressing contemporary challenges in food systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it introduces a novel paradigm—Culinary Ecosystem Theory—that views cuisines as dynamic systems influenced by ecological principles. By applying systems thinking to culinary practices, this dissertation will address contemporary challenges in food sustainability, health, and innovation. The integration of ecological principles into culinary frameworks not only enhances our understanding of food systems but also promotes practices that are more sustainable, health-conscious, and culturally relevant.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can ecological principles enhance our understanding of culinary practices?
2. What are the implications of viewing cuisines as ecosystems for culinary innovation and sustainability?
3. How can the integration of these concepts inform culinary education and industry practices?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Studies

Ecosystem studies have a rich history, beginning with foundational theories such as the Gaia Hypothesis and the concept of ecological succession. Early ecologists like Eugene Odum established frameworks for understanding energy flow and nutrient cycling within ecosystems. Methodologies have evolved from observational studies to complex modeling approaches that incorporate biogeochemical cycles and trophic interactions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of ecological dynamics.

#### Culinary Arts

The culinary arts have evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural exchanges, technological advancements, and shifts in societal values. Historical culinary practices, from the use of fire in prehistoric times to the development of haute cuisine in France, reflect the changing relationship between humans and food. The evolution of culinary arts is marked by a growing emphasis on flavor, presentation, and the cultural significance of food, culminating in the contemporary farm-to-table movement that emphasizes local sourcing and sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Ecological Research

Contemporary ecological research focuses on pressing issues such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable resource management. Studies highlight the importance of preserving ecosystem services, which provide essential benefits to humanity, including food production, clean water, and climate regulation. Innovations in ecological modeling and conservation strategies are critical for addressing these challenges.

#### Culinary Trends

Current culinary trends reflect a growing awareness of health and sustainability, with movements such as plant-based diets, zero-waste cooking, and the integration of indigenous food practices gaining traction. However, challenges remain, particularly in the context of food deserts, global food security, and the impact of industrial agriculture on health and the environment.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both ecology and culinary arts, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these fields. This dissertation identifies underexplored intersections between ecological principles and culinary practices, presenting opportunities for innovation through collaboration. By framing culinary practices within an ecological context, this research seeks to illuminate new pathways for sustainability and health in food systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theory

Ecosystem theory encompasses principles of biodiversity, energy flow, and nutrient cycling. Biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem resilience, allowing systems to adapt to changes and disturbances. Energy flow, characterized by the transfer of energy through food webs, highlights the interconnectedness of organisms. Nutrient cycling emphasizes the importance of decomposers and nutrient availability in sustaining life.

#### Culinary Theory

Culinary theory explores concepts of flavor profiles, ingredient sourcing, and cultural significance. Flavor profiles are shaped by the chemical composition of ingredients and their interactions during cooking. Ingredient sourcing emphasizes the importance of local and seasonal produce, while cultural significance underscores the role of food in identity and community.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Ecosystem Theory

Culinary Ecosystem Theory posits that cuisines can be understood as dynamic ecosystems, where ingredients, cooking methods, and cultural practices interact in complex ways. This framework allows for the exploration of culinary diversity and resilience, drawing parallels between ecological and culinary systems.

#### Flavor Trophic Levels

The concept of Flavor Trophic Levels analyzes ingredient interactions and their roles in dish composition. Just as ecosystems are structured by trophic levels, culinary creations can be understood through the lens of ingredient hierarchy—where certain ingredients serve as foundational elements that influence the overall flavor and texture of a dish.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual representation of the interactions between ecological principles and culinary practices will be developed, illustrating how biodiversity, energy flow, and nutrient cycling manifest in culinary ecosystems. This model will serve as a foundation for empirical research and practical applications.

| **Ecological Principle** | **Culinary Application** | **Implications for Sustainability** |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Biodiversity             | Diverse ingredient sourcing | Enhanced resilience and adaptability in culinary practices |
| Energy Flow              | Cooking methods and techniques | Optimization of flavor and resource use |
| Nutrient Cycling         | Creative use of leftovers  | Reduction of food waste and promotion of sustainability |
