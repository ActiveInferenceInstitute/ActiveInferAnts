## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of health care and mitochondrial biology, emphasizing the importance of holistic approaches to cellular health. Health care traditionally focuses on patient experiences and outcomes, while mitochondrial biology investigates the fundamental processes of energy production and metabolism at the cellular level. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, highlighting the parallels and synergies between patient-centered care and mitochondrial function.

Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, play a critical role in energy production, metabolic regulation, and apoptosis. Their dysfunction is implicated in a wide range of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and various forms of cancer. Conversely, the evolution of health care towards a more patient-centered model emphasizes the importance of understanding patient experiences, preferences, and outcomes. By integrating these two domains, this dissertation posits that we can gain a deeper understanding of mitochondrial health and its implications for patient care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it proposes a new paradigm that recognizes the interconnectedness of health care and cellular biology. By applying health care principles to mitochondrial research, this study aims to develop personalized treatment strategies that enhance mitochondrial health, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The novelty lies in creating a theoretical framework that integrates concepts from both fields, thereby advancing our understanding of health at both the cellular and systemic levels.

The integration of health care principles into mitochondrial biology is poised to address several critical gaps in current research and practice, including the need for personalized interventions that consider individual mitochondrial profiles, the establishment of quality metrics for mitochondrial health, and the incorporation of advanced technologies in diagnostics and treatment.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of patient-centered care has transformed the landscape of health care delivery. The shift from a provider-centric model to one that prioritizes the patient experience has been driven by growing recognition of the importance of patient engagement, shared decision-making, and the need for holistic care. Key developments include the introduction of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010) in the United States, which emphasized the importance of quality care and patient satisfaction metrics. Additionally, the rise of digital health technologies has enabled more personalized and accessible care, allowing patients to take an active role in managing their health.

#### Mitochondrial Biology

Historically, the understanding of mitochondrial function has evolved significantly. Early research focused on the role of mitochondria in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, while subsequent studies revealed their involvement in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The discovery of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and its implications for genetic diseases has further underscored the importance of mitochondria in health and disease. Recent advancements in mitochondrial biology have highlighted the role of mitochondrial dynamics—fusion and fission processes—in maintaining cellular health and responding to stress.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Health Care

Recent advancements in personalized medicine have transformed health care delivery, enabling tailored interventions based on individual patient characteristics. The integration of digital health technologies, such as telemedicine and wearable health devices, has facilitated real-time monitoring and management of health conditions. Furthermore, the growing emphasis on health equity and social determinants of health has prompted a more comprehensive understanding of patient experiences and outcomes.

#### Mitochondrial Biology

Current research in mitochondrial biology has expanded to encompass a variety of therapeutic approaches, including mitochondrial replacement therapy, gene editing, and pharmacological interventions aimed at enhancing mitochondrial function. The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and age-related diseases has also gained attention, leading to the exploration of potential interventions to promote mitochondrial health and longevity.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both health care and mitochondrial biology, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects patient-centered health care with mitochondrial biology. This gap presents an opportunity to develop new frameworks and methodologies that leverage insights from both domains to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial health and its implications for patient care. By exploring the intersections between these fields, this dissertation aims to identify innovative approaches to address mitochondrial dysfunction and improve patient outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Health Care

Theories of patient-centered care emphasize the importance of understanding patient needs, preferences, and values in the delivery of health care. The concept of service quality in health care, as articulated by the SERVQUAL model, highlights the dimensions of reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles as critical components of patient satisfaction. Continuous improvement methodologies, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), provide frameworks for enhancing care delivery and patient outcomes.

#### Mitochondrial Biology

Theories related to mitochondrial function encompass the bioenergetics of mitochondria, the role of oxidative stress in cellular aging, and the mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics. The concept of mitochondrial biogenesis, regulated by factors such as PGC-1α, underscores the importance of maintaining mitochondrial health through adaptive responses to metabolic demands. Additionally, the role of mitophagy in removing damaged mitochondria is critical for cellular homeostasis.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of health care principles into mitochondrial biology leads to the development of new theoretical constructs, including "Mitochondrial Patient-Centered Care" and "Mitochondrial Quality Assurance." These constructs emphasize the importance of individualized assessments of mitochondrial health and the establishment of quality metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between patient-centered health care principles and mitochondrial health. This model emphasizes the importance of personalized approaches that consider individual mitochondrial profiles, the establishment of quality metrics for assessing mitochondrial function, and the integration of advanced technologies in diagnostics and treatment. By fostering collaboration between health care providers and mitochondrial researchers, this model aims to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction and its implications for patient care.
