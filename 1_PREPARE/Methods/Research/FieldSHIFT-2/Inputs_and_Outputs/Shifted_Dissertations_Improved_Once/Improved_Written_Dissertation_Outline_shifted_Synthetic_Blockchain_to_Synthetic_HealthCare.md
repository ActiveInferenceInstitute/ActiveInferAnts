## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology was first introduced in 2008 by an individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto as the underlying technology for Bitcoin. Its core principles include decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Decentralization eliminates the need for a central authority, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions. Immutability ensures that once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus from the network. Transparency provides all participants with access to the same data, fostering trust among stakeholders.

Since its inception, blockchain has evolved significantly, with applications extending beyond cryptocurrencies to sectors such as finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. The potential of blockchain in healthcare has garnered increasing attention, particularly regarding data security, patient privacy, and interoperability.

| Healthcare         | Decentralized health records, Secure data sharing                | Improved patient care, enhanced data integrity|

#### Historical Challenges in Healthcare

The healthcare sector has long been plagued by issues such as data fragmentation, inefficient patient engagement, and rising costs. Traditional electronic health record (EHR) systems often operate in silos, leading to incomplete patient information and challenges in care coordination. Moreover, patient engagement strategies have struggled to empower individuals in managing their health, often resulting in low adherence to treatment plans and poor health outcomes. Rising healthcare costs further exacerbate these challenges, necessitating innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and reduce waste.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Blockchain Applications in Various Sectors

Numerous studies have explored blockchain applications across various sectors, highlighting its potential to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency. For instance, in supply chain management, blockchain ensures product traceability and authenticity, mitigating risks of fraud. In finance, blockchain streamlines transactions and reduces costs associated with intermediaries. However, the application of blockchain in healthcare remains in its infancy, with limited empirical evidence supporting its efficacy.

#### Current Healthcare Practices and Challenges

Current healthcare practices heavily rely on electronic health records (EHRs) and health information exchanges (HIEs) to facilitate data sharing among providers. However, these systems face challenges related to interoperability, data privacy, and security. Patient engagement strategies often focus on technology-driven solutions, such as mobile health applications, but struggle to address the underlying issues of trust and accessibility.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps

Despite the growing interest in blockchain technology, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks for its implementation in healthcare. Existing literature primarily focuses on theoretical discussions rather than empirical studies demonstrating practical applications. Additionally, there is limited understanding of how blockchain can enhance patient engagement and operational efficiency.

#### Exploration of Opportunities

The integration of blockchain technology into healthcare presents numerous opportunities for innovation and improvement. By enabling decentralized health records, transparent treatment histories, and automated processes through smart contracts, blockchain can address many of the challenges currently faced by the healthcare industry. Furthermore, the tokenization of health incentives has the potential to influence patient behavior positively, promoting adherence to treatment plans and improving health outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Decentralization Theory

Decentralization theory posits that distributing power and authority across various stakeholders can enhance decision-making and foster innovation. In the context of blockchain, decentralization enables multiple parties to maintain control over their data, reducing the risks associated with centralization.

#### Trust and Transparency in Digital Transactions

Trust is a critical component of digital transactions, particularly in healthcare, where sensitive patient information is exchanged. Blockchain’s transparent nature fosters trust among stakeholders by ensuring that all participants have access to the same information, reducing the likelihood of fraud and misinformation.

#### The Role of Automation in Operational Efficiency

Automation has been shown to enhance operational efficiency by streamlining processes and reducing the potential for human error. In healthcare, the implementation of smart contracts can automate administrative tasks, such as billing and claims processing, leading to significant cost savings and improved service delivery.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Decentralized Patient Control over Health Data

The concept of decentralized patient control over health data challenges traditional notions of data ownership and access. Blockchain empowers patients to manage their health information, granting them the ability to share data selectively with healthcare providers while maintaining control over their privacy.

#### The Role of Smart Contracts in Automating Healthcare Processes

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In healthcare, smart contracts can automate various processes, such as claims processing and patient consent management, reducing administrative burdens and enhancing efficiency.

#### Token Economics in Health Behavior Incentives

Token economics refers to the use of digital tokens to incentivize specific behaviors. In healthcare, the tokenization of health incentives can encourage patients to engage in healthier behaviors, such as attending regular check-ups and adhering to treatment plans, ultimately improving health outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines blockchain principles with healthcare operational frameworks, illustrating the interactions between decentralized data management, patient engagement, and service quality. This model serves as a foundation for understanding how blockchain can transform healthcare practices and address existing challenges.
