# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Insect Behavior and Ecology

Insects, as one of the most diverse groups of organisms, have been the subject of extensive study in ecology and behavior. Key concepts include metamorphosis, which describes the transformation of insects from larval stages to adulthood, highlighting the importance of adaptability and change. Specialization among insect species allows them to occupy various ecological niches, demonstrating how diverse strategies can lead to successful coexistence. Social structures in insects, particularly in species like ants and bees, illustrate complex communication methods and collaborative behaviors that enhance survival and efficiency. Understanding these dynamics provides a foundation for exploring how similar principles can be applied in hospitality settings.

### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The traditional theories of guest experience center on service quality, personalization, and the overall customer journey. Historically, the hospitality industry has grappled with challenges such as service inconsistency, the integration of technology, and the need for personalized experiences. The emergence of digital tools has transformed guest interactions, yet significant gaps remain in effectively utilizing these technologies to enhance satisfaction. The literature suggests that a deeper understanding of guest needs and preferences is essential for improving service delivery and fostering loyalty.

|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| SERVQUAL Model            | Assesses service quality across five dimensions   | Evaluates guest interactions             |
| Experience Economy        | Focuses on creating memorable experiences          | Enhances personalization and engagement  |
| Relationship Marketing     | Emphasizes building long-term relationships       | Fosters guest loyalty and retention      |

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Insect Studies

Recent advancements in insect studies have illuminated the intricacies of communication and social behavior. Research highlights the role of pheromones in insect interaction, showcasing how these chemical signals facilitate complex social structures and cooperation. Current trends in entomology focus on ecological roles, adaptations to environmental changes, and the implications of insect behavior for biodiversity. These insights provide a rich context for exploring analogous applications in hospitality management.

### Guest Experience Research

Recent studies in hospitality emphasize the importance of personalization, the role of technology in enhancing guest interactions, and the impact of sustainability on guest satisfaction. The ongoing debates surrounding data privacy and the ethics of personalization present critical challenges that require careful consideration. As the industry evolves, there is a growing recognition of the need for frameworks that balance technological advancements with ethical considerations and guest-centric approaches.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both entomology and hospitality, there exists a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges these two fields. The potential for innovative service models inspired by biological principles remains largely untapped. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing frameworks that reflect the evolving nature of guest interactions and the integration of biological insights into hospitality practices.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The study of metamorphosis in biology serves as a foundational theory for understanding transformation processes. This concept can be applied to the guest journey, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and growth in guest experiences. The SERVQUAL model, which assesses service quality based on dimensions such as reliability, assurance, and empathy, provides a complementary framework for evaluating guest interactions in hospitality.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### The Metamorphosis Model of Guest Experience

This model draws parallels between the stages of insect metamorphosis and the guest journey, highlighting the importance of each phase in shaping overall satisfaction. By understanding how guests transition through pre-arrival, arrival, stay, and post-departure phases, hospitality managers can design experiences that facilitate positive transformations.

### The Ecosystemic Guest Engagement Model

Inspired by ecological principles, this model emphasizes the interconnectedness of various elements within the hospitality ecosystem. It considers the roles of guests, staff, technology, and the environment in shaping guest experiences, promoting a holistic approach to service delivery.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The comprehensive model proposed in this dissertation integrates principles of entomology with hospitality management, aiming to enhance guest experiences. By combining insights from insect behavior with established hospitality theories, this model provides a framework for understanding and optimizing guest interactions.

### Hypotheses for Testing

1. **H1:** The implementation of the Metamorphosis Model will lead to a measurable increase in guest satisfaction scores compared to conventional service models.
2. **H2:** Increased training based on the Ecosystemic Guest Engagement Model will enhance staff collaboration and improve service delivery metrics.
3. **H3:** Personalization strategies inspired by insect specialization will yield higher guest retention rates.
