## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that adaptive systems, including biological organisms, minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. This principle suggests that living systems actively engage with their environment to reduce uncertainty by predicting sensory inputs and adapting their behavior accordingly. Active Inference extends this idea by emphasizing how organisms not only predict but also act to confirm their predictions, thereby reducing uncertainty through a cyclical process of perception and action.

Conversely, logistics focuses on the planning, implementation, and control of the flow of goods and services. It encompasses a range of activities, from procurement and inventory management to transportation and distribution. Traditionally, logistics has relied on deterministic models and historical data to inform decision-making processes. However, the increasing complexity of global supply chains and the volatility of market demands necessitate a more adaptive and predictive approach.

This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these domains, examining how principles from cognitive science can inform logistics practices. By applying the FEP and Active Inference, logistics can be reframed as an adaptive system capable of leveraging predictive models to enhance operational efficiency and resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, merging cognitive science with logistics. It offers a novel perspective by framing logistics as an adaptive system that can leverage predictive models and active inference to enhance operational efficiency. This innovative approach not only fills existing gaps in logistics literature but also opens new avenues for research and application.

The novelty of this research lies in its potential to redefine logistics practices through the lens of cognitive science. By integrating FEP and Active Inference, this dissertation aims to provide logistics professionals with a robust framework for navigating uncertainty and optimizing decision-making processes. The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions, offering practical solutions that can be implemented in real-world logistics operations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can concepts from the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be effectively transposed into logistics?
2. What are the implications of applying predictive modeling and active inference in logistics decision-making processes?
3. How can the concept of variational free energy be utilized to assess and improve supply chain resilience?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
