## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Health Care Evolution

The evolution of health care has been marked by significant shifts in focus, particularly towards patient-centered care. This approach emerged in response to critiques of traditional, paternalistic models of care that often marginalized patient voices and preferences. The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the importance of patient-centered care in improving health outcomes, advocating for practices that empower patients through shared decision-making, effective communication, and individualized care plans. 

#### Examination of Cognitive Security Development

Conversely, cognitive security has emerged as a critical area of study in response to the proliferation of misinformation and its potential to undermine democratic processes and individual decision-making. Cognitive security encompasses strategies aimed at safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, including misinformation, propaganda, and cognitive biases. However, traditional cognitive security measures often lack user-centered approaches, leading to a disconnect between the strategies employed and the needs of individuals and communities.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in health care methodologies, particularly those emphasizing user engagement and shared decision-making, have shown promise in improving health outcomes. In cognitive security, technological innovations such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are being deployed to combat misinformation. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges these two domains, highlighting an opportunity for further exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in the application of user-centered approaches within cognitive security. While health care has made strides in incorporating patient feedback and engagement, cognitive security practices often remain top-down and reactive. This dissertation seeks to capitalize on this gap by proposing a framework that incorporates health care principles into cognitive security, thereby fostering a more proactive and user-centered approach to cognitive resilience.

This dissertation proposes the development of a user-centered cognitive security framework that integrates health care principles. This framework will prioritize user engagement, feedback, and holistic approaches, ensuring that cognitive security measures are responsive to the needs of individuals and communities. 

#### Psychological Resilience Theories

Psychological resilience theories, which emphasize the capacity to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity, will also be integrated into cognitive security practices. By fostering resilience, individuals can better navigate cognitive threats and misinformation. This integration underscores the importance of not only protecting cognitive processes but also enhancing individuals' overall psychological well-being.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model will combine health care principles with cognitive security strategies, focusing on user engagement, feedback, and holistic approaches. This model will serve as a foundation for developing practical applications and interventions in cognitive security.
