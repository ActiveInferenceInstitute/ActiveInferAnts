## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long been a canvas for human creativity, encompassing design, sustainability, and cultural expression. From the earliest woven materials to contemporary digital textiles, the evolution of fabric arts reflects not only technological advancements but also societal values and ecological considerations. Concurrently, Hymenoptera represent a complex biological domain characterized by intricate social structures and environmental adaptations. These insects, particularly ants and bees, are not only pivotal in their ecosystems but also symbolize collective effort and resilience in nature. This dissertation aims to fuse these two domains by exploring how textile design principles can inform and enhance our understanding of Hymenoptera.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on both fields, addressing the urgent need for sustainable practices in the fabric industry while simultaneously highlighting the ecological importance of Hymenoptera. The novelty lies in the application of artistic principles to biological structures, creating a new lens through which to view both art and ecology. By focusing on the parallels between textile design and the architecture of insect nests, this study seeks to generate interdisciplinary insights that can inform both artistic practices and ecological conservation efforts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Fabric Industry
The evolution of the fabric industry can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where textiles served both practical and decorative purposes. The transition from traditional crafts to modern textile production has been marked by technological advancements such as mechanized weaving and synthetic fibers. These developments have not only transformed production processes but also raised critical questions regarding sustainability and environmental impact. The increasing reliance on synthetic materials has led to significant ecological degradation, prompting a re-evaluation of design practices.

#### Hymenoptera
Historically, Hymenoptera have held significant roles in ecosystems, contributing to pollination, soil aeration, and pest control. Their complex social structures, particularly in species such as bees and ants, have fascinated scientists and cultural theorists alike. The cultural significance of these insects is reflected in various artistic representations, folklore, and ecological studies, highlighting their integral role in human culture. Recent studies have underscored the urgent need for conservation efforts, given the alarming decline in Hymenoptera populations worldwide.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Textile Arts
Recent advances in sustainable materials, such as organic cotton and recycled fibers, have prompted a shift towards eco-friendly practices in the textile industry. Digital design technologies, including 3D printing and computer-aided design, are revolutionizing the way textiles are conceived and produced, allowing for greater customization and reduced waste. However, there remains a significant gap in the integration of ecological principles with artistic practices, which this dissertation aims to address.

#### Hymenoptera Studies
Recent research on Hymenoptera has expanded our understanding of their social behavior, communication methods, and ecological roles. Studies have revealed the sophisticated ways in which these insects interact with their environment, including the use of pheromones for communication and the construction of complex nests that serve various ecological functions. This body of knowledge presents a rich source of inspiration for sustainable design practices in textiles.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich histories and advancements in both fields, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary studies combining textile design and ecological principles. This gap presents a unique opportunity to develop new sustainable practices informed by biological insights. By examining the parallels between textile design and the architecture of Hymenoptera, this research aims to fill this void and propose innovative solutions for both industries.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Creativity and Aesthetics in Textile Design
Theories of creativity in textile design often emphasize the interplay between functionality and aesthetics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Biotextiles
The concept of "Biotextiles" emerges as a new theoretical framework that bridges the gap between living structures and artistic expression. This framework will be articulated through an analysis of the structural and functional parallels between textile patterns and insect nests, emphasizing sustainability and cultural narratives. The theoretical underpinnings of Biotextiles will be supported by examples from both fields, illustrating the potential for cross-disciplinary innovation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated theoretical model will be proposed to illustrate the parallels between textile patterns and nest structures. This model will highlight the significance of sustainability in both domains and the cultural narratives that emerge from this intersection. The model will serve as a foundation for further research and practical applications in both fields.
