## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

**Overview of Hymenoptera Studies**  
The study of Hymenoptera has evolved significantly since the 19th century, with early research focusing on the taxonomy and behavior of these insects. Groundbreaking studies by researchers such as William Kirby and Charles Darwin laid the foundation for understanding the evolution of sociality in ants and bees. Key concepts such as kin selection and inclusive fitness have been instrumental in explaining the emergence of complex social structures, where individuals work cooperatively for the benefit of the colony. Recent advancements in molecular biology and genetic studies have further elucidated the mechanisms underlying social behaviors, revealing the genetic bases for division of labor and communication.

**Development of the Free Energy Principle**  
The Free Energy Principle was formalized by Karl Friston in the early 21st century, positing that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle has been influential in cognitive science, providing a framework for understanding how organisms adapt to their environments by making predictions and updating beliefs based on sensory input. The FEP has been applied to various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and robotics, highlighting its versatility in explaining adaptive behaviors. Recent theoretical advancements have expanded the FEP to encompass social systems, suggesting that collective behaviors may also be understood through the lens of free energy minimization.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

**Hymenoptera's Social Dynamics and Communication**  
Recent research has expanded our understanding of the social dynamics within Hymenoptera colonies. Studies have shown that division of labor, task allocation, and communication through pheromones and dances play crucial roles in colony efficiency. The waggle dance of honeybees, for instance, is a sophisticated form of communication that conveys information about the direction and distance of food sources, demonstrating the complexity of social interactions. Furthermore, the emergence of new technologies, such as advanced imaging and tracking systems, has allowed researchers to observe and analyze these behaviors in unprecedented detail.

**Application of the Free Energy Principle**  
The FEP has gained traction in explaining cognitive processes and adaptive systems. Researchers have utilized the principle to model decision-making, learning, and perception, emphasizing the role of prediction in shaping behavior. However, there remains a gap in applying the FEP to biological systems, particularly in understanding collective intelligence and social behaviors in organisms such as Hymenoptera. The integration of FEP with biological models presents a novel opportunity to explore how these principles can inform our understanding of complex adaptive systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges biological systems and cognitive models. The synthesis of insights from Hymenoptera and the FEP presents a unique opportunity to develop new theoretical frameworks that can enhance our understanding of collective behavior, communication, and adaptation. This research aims to fill this gap by exploring the parallels between these domains and proposing integrated models that can inform both biological and cognitive sciences.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

**Social Organization Theories in Hymenoptera**  
The social organization of Hymenoptera is characterized by complex hierarchies and division of labor. Theories such as the division of labor hypothesis and the task allocation model explain how individuals within a colony specialize in specific roles, optimizing colony efficiency. These theories also highlight the adaptive significance of social structures, where cooperation and coordination enhance survival and resource acquisition. Recent studies have introduced the concept of "task switching," where individuals dynamically change roles in response to environmental demands, thereby enhancing the colony's adaptability.

**Theoretical Underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle**  
The FEP is grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and information theory. It posits that living systems minimize free energy by maintaining a balance between internal states and external environments. This theoretical framework emphasizes the importance of prediction and inference in guiding behavior, suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environments to reduce uncertainty. The FEP also incorporates the notion of "active inference," where organisms not only predict sensory inputs but also take actions to fulfill their predictions, thereby shaping their environments.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

**Collective Free Energy Minimization**  
This proposed concept extends the FEP to collective systems, suggesting that groups, such as Hymenoptera colonies, engage in collective free energy minimization. By coordinating actions and sharing information, individuals within a colony can optimize decision-making processes and resource allocation, thereby enhancing overall efficiency. This construct challenges traditional views of individualistic decision-making, proposing that collective behaviors can be understood as emergent phenomena arising from individual actions guided by shared goals.

**Hierarchical Nesting of Models**  
The hierarchical nesting of models framework proposes that both biological and cognitive systems can be understood through nested levels of organization. This framework allows for the analysis of how individual behaviors contribute to collective outcomes, highlighting the interconnectedness of social dynamics and cognitive processes. By employing this framework, researchers can explore how local interactions among individuals lead to emergent properties at the group level, thereby enriching our understanding of complex adaptive systems.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation will develop an integrated model that illustrates the parallels between Hymenoptera behavior and cognitive processes governed by the Free Energy Principle. The model will encompass key components such as communication, decision-making, and adaptation, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between biological and cognitive systems. This integrated approach will facilitate the exploration of how principles from one domain can inform and enhance understanding in the other, ultimately contributing to the development of more sophisticated models of collective intelligence.
