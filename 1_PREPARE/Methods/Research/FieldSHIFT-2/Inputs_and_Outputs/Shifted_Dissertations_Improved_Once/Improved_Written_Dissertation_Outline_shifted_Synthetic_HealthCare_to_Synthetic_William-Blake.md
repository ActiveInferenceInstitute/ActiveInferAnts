## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges healthcare's patient-centered approach with William Blake's artistic vision, creating a unique framework for understanding both individual experiences in healthcare and the engagement of audiences with art. This innovative fusion recognizes the importance of personal connection and emotional impact in both domains. Patient-centered care emphasizes understanding patients' needs, preferences, and values, thus fostering a more holistic approach to healthcare. Similarly, Blake's work embodies a deep exploration of human emotion and experience, advocating for the individual's journey through both suffering and joy. By aligning these two realms, this dissertation seeks to illuminate how artistic practices can enhance patient experiences and vice versa.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, offering fresh insights into how healthcare principles can enhance artistic practices and vice versa. It positions Blake's work within a contemporary context, emphasizing the relevance of his ideas in today's healthcare and artistic landscapes. The significance of this study is underscored by the increasing recognition of the arts in healthcare settings, where art therapy has emerged as a valuable tool for promoting mental health and well-being. By drawing connections between Blake's artistic philosophy and modern healthcare practices, this dissertation aims to fill a critical gap in the existing literature.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can healthcare principles enhance audience engagement with Blake's art?
- In what ways can Blake's artistic philosophy inform patient-centered care practices?
- What are the potential therapeutic benefits of integrating art into healthcare settings?

These questions guide the exploration of the intertwined nature of art and healthcare, aiming to uncover new methodologies and practices that can lead to improved emotional and physical well-being for individuals.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Healthcare Evolution and the Emergence of Patient-Centered Care

The evolution of healthcare has been marked by significant shifts in paradigms, particularly from a paternalistic model to one that emphasizes patient autonomy and engagement. The emergence of patient-centered care in the late 20th century represents a pivotal transformation, advocating for a holistic approach that prioritizes patients' experiences and preferences. This shift has been influenced by various factors, including the rise of chronic diseases, the demand for personalized medicine, and the recognition of the psychological aspects of healing.

#### Examination of William Blake's Life, Artistic Philosophy, and Societal Critiques

William Blake (1757-1827) was not only a poet and painter but also a social critic whose work reflects the tumultuous changes of his time. His artistic philosophy, rooted in a deep understanding of human emotion, emphasizes the duality of innocence and experience. Blake's critique of institutional authority, particularly in relation to religion and government, resonates with contemporary discussions on the importance of individual agency in both art and healthcare. His belief in the transformative power of imagination and creativity serves as a foundation for exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of art in healthcare settings.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Existing Literature on Patient Experience, Service Quality, and Artistic Engagement

The literature on patient experience has expanded significantly, highlighting the importance of emotional support, communication, and the overall healthcare environment in shaping patient outcomes. Concurrently, studies on artistic engagement reveal the profound impact of art on emotional well-being, cognitive function, and social connection. However, there remains a dearth of research that explicitly connects these two fields, indicating a need for interdisciplinary exploration.

#### Analysis of Interdisciplinary Studies That Bridge Healthcare and the Arts

Interdisciplinary studies have begun to emerge, focusing on the therapeutic effects of art in healthcare settings. Research has shown that art therapy can reduce anxiety, improve mood, and enhance the overall quality of life for patients. Nevertheless, the integration of Blake's artistic philosophy into this discourse remains largely unexplored, presenting an opportunity for new insights and methodologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Insufficient Research on the Intersection of Healthcare and Art

Despite the growing recognition of the arts in healthcare, there is a notable lack of comprehensive research that systematically examines the intersection of these fields. Existing studies often focus on isolated aspects of art therapy or audience engagement without considering the broader implications of integrating artistic principles into patient care.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Integrating Audience Engagement Techniques into Healthcare Practices

The Shifted Domain presents an opportunity to explore how audience engagement techniques, commonly used in the arts, can be adapted to enhance patient experiences in healthcare. By examining the ways in which Blake's art engages viewers on an emotional level, this research aims to uncover strategies that can be applied in healthcare settings to foster deeper connections between patients and providers.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Health Belief Models and Theories of Patient Engagement

Health belief models, such as the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), provide a framework for understanding how individuals make health-related decisions. These theories emphasize the role of beliefs, attitudes, and perceived barriers in shaping patient engagement. By applying these models to the context of artistic engagement, this dissertation seeks to illuminate how emotional connections to art can influence health behaviors and outcomes.

#### Blake's Duality of Innocence and Experience as a Lens for Understanding Human Nature

Blake's exploration of innocence and experience serves as a powerful lens for understanding the complexities of human nature. This duality can be applied to the healthcare context, where the innocence of patients' experiences must be balanced with the harsh realities of illness and suffering. By acknowledging this duality, healthcare providers can better address the emotional needs of patients, fostering a more compassionate and holistic approach to care.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### The Concept of "Artistic Care" and Its Implications for Audience Engagement

The concept of "Artistic Care" emerges as a new theoretical construct that integrates principles of patient-centered care with artistic practices. This framework emphasizes the importance of emotional engagement in both art and healthcare, suggesting that artistic expression can serve as a vehicle for healing and connection. By fostering an environment where patients and audiences can engage with art on a personal level, healthcare providers can enhance the therapeutic potential of artistic practices.

#### The "Theory of Artistic Healing" as a Framework for Therapeutic Art Practices

The "Theory of Artistic Healing" posits that engagement with art can facilitate emotional and psychological healing, paralleling the principles of patient-centered care. This theory emphasizes the role of creativity in promoting resilience, self-expression, and connection, suggesting that artistic practices can be integrated into healthcare settings to enhance patient outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes patient-centered care principles with Blake's artistic philosophy, emphasizing emotional engagement and holistic experiences. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the practical applications of this research, guiding the development of methodologies and interventions that bridge the gap between healthcare and the arts.
