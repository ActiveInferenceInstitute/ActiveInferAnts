## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems strive to minimize their variational free energy to maintain stability. This principle has been extensively discussed in the context of biological systems, where organisms are viewed as predictive machines that continuously adjust their internal states to minimize the difference between expected and actual sensory inputs. In contrast, traditional chemical reaction theories focus primarily on kinetics, thermodynamics, and equilibrium, often neglecting the adaptive nature of chemical systems. The intersection of these two domains presents an opportunity to develop a more holistic understanding of chemical processes, whereby chemical reactions can be viewed through the lens of adaptive systems that predict and respond to environmental changes.

This integration prompts a fundamental question: **How can we leverage the adaptive characteristics of chemical reactions to enhance our understanding of reaction mechanisms and catalysis?** By framing chemical reactions as systems that minimize free energy, we can uncover new insights into reaction mechanisms and catalyst efficiency. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

By framing chemical reactions as systems that minimize free energy, we can uncover new insights into reaction mechanisms and catalyst efficiency. This novel framework not only enhances our understanding of chemical dynamics but also provides a foundation for developing more effective catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions, ultimately leading to advancements in sustainable chemistry practices.

The implications of this work extend beyond theoretical understanding; they encompass practical applications in various fields, including materials science, environmental chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. By enhancing our predictive capabilities, we can better tailor chemical processes to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world.

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle and Its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has its roots in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, articulated by figures such as Helmholtz and Gibbs. The principle suggests that systems, whether biological or chemical, tend to minimize their free energy to achieve a state of equilibrium. This theoretical foundation has been expanded upon in various fields, particularly in biology, where it has been used to explain phenomena ranging from neural processing to evolutionary dynamics.

#### Exploration of Traditional Chemical Reaction Theories

Traditional chemical theories, including Arrhenius' equation and transition state theory, focus on the relationship between reaction rates and energy barriers. Kinetics and thermodynamics have provided essential insights into reaction mechanisms, equilibrium states, and the influence of temperature and concentration on chemical processes. However, these theories often fall short of addressing the dynamic nature of chemical systems, which can adapt and evolve over time.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
