## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemistry

Chemistry has evolved significantly throughout history, with key developments shaping our understanding of chemical theory. The study of reaction kinetics has elucidated the rates at which chemical reactions occur, while thermodynamics provides insight into energy transformations and the feasibility of reactions. Catalysis, a crucial concept in chemistry, enhances reaction rates and selectivity, making it indispensable in both industrial and environmental applications. 

In recent years, the emergence of **green chemistry** has further underscored the importance of sustainability within the discipline, focusing on minimizing the environmental impact of chemical processes. This evolution highlights the need for a paradigm shift that aligns chemical practices with sustainable design methodologies.

#### Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller’s contributions to design philosophy are profound, particularly his emphasis on holistic systems thinking. His concept of **tensegrity**—structures that maintain integrity through a network of discontinuous components—challenges traditional notions of architectural design. Furthermore, Fuller’s focus on resource management and sustainability has influenced various fields, encouraging a shift toward more efficient and responsible design practices.

Fuller’s assertion that “we are all astronauts on a little spaceship called Earth” encapsulates the urgency of addressing global sustainability challenges through integrated approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in chemistry increasingly emphasizes sustainability and resource efficiency, focusing on green chemistry principles that aim to minimize environmental impact. In parallel, design practices influenced by Fuller’s principles have gained traction, particularly in sustainable architecture and systems thinking. However, there remains a disconnect between these fields, with limited interdisciplinary collaboration that could yield innovative solutions.
