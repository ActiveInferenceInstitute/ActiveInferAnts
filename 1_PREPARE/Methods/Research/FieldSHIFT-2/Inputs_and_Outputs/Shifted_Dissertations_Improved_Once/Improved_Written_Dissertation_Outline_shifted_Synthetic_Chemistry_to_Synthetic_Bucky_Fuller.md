## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of chemistry has transitioned from classical studies focused on the properties of matter and reactions to advanced explorations of molecular behavior, emphasizing the importance of understanding interactions at the atomic level. Architectural design, on the other hand, has historically prioritized aesthetics and functionality, often neglecting sustainability. The advent of modern architecture, exemplified by Fuller’s work, began to challenge these conventions, advocating for designs that are not only visually appealing but also environmentally conscious.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current trends in chemistry emphasize green practices, nanotechnology, and the development of sustainable materials. Architectural discourse increasingly addresses sustainability, resource efficiency, and the integration of technology in building design. However, the integration of these fields remains underexplored, with few studies investigating how chemical principles can directly inform architectural practices. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research that can lead to the development of more sustainable and adaptive structures.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying synergies between chemistry and architectural design reveals opportunities for innovative practices that enhance sustainability. The literature lacks comprehensive studies that bridge these disciplines, highlighting a critical gap this research aims to fill. By exploring the intersection of these fields, this dissertation seeks to create a framework that can guide future architectural practices towards greater sustainability and efficiency.
