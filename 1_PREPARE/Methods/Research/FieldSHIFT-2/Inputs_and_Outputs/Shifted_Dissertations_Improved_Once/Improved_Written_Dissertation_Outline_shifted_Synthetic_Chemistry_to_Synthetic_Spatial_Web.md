## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Chemical Reaction Theories
Chemical reaction theories have evolved significantly since their inception, transitioning from classical theories of stoichiometry to modern interpretations that incorporate quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. The fundamental principles of reaction kinetics, thermodynamic stability, and catalytic processes have been extensively studied, providing a robust framework for understanding how substances interact and transform. These principles can be analogously applied to user interactions, where inputs (reactants) undergo transformations (reactions) to yield outcomes (products).

#### Evolution of the Spatial Web
The concept of the Spatial Web has emerged from the convergence of various technologies, including AR, IoT, and AI, which collectively enable the integration of digital information into physical spaces. While the potential of the Spatial Web is immense, challenges such as user engagement, data overload, and the need for seamless interactions persist. The historical development of the Spatial Web highlights the necessity for innovative frameworks that can enhance user experiences by addressing these challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### User Experience in Digital Environments
The literature on user experience (UX) emphasizes the importance of understanding user needs, behaviors, and contexts in designing digital interfaces. Current methodologies, such as user-centered design and usability testing, focus primarily on the aesthetic and functional aspects of digital interactions. However, there is a growing recognition of the need for more dynamic models that can account for the fluidity of user experiences in the Spatial Web.

#### Chemical Principles Related to Transformation, Catalysis, and Kinetics
Research in chemistry has identified key principles that govern the behavior of chemical reactions, including concepts of transformation, catalysis, and reaction kinetics. These principles offer valuable insights into the dynamics of interactions, suggesting that user experiences can be similarly analyzed and optimized through an understanding of these processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich theoretical foundations in both chemistry and user experience design, significant gaps exist in the current research that fails to connect these domains. The lack of interdisciplinary studies that leverage insights from chemical principles to enhance digital interactions presents a unique opportunity for exploration. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a framework that integrates chemical principles into the analysis of user experiences in the Spatial Web.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Chemical Reaction Theory
Chemical reaction theory encompasses a range of concepts that describe how substances interact and transform. Key principles include the conservation of mass, the role of catalysts in accelerating reactions, and the concept of equilibrium, where reactants and products coexist in a stable state. These principles can be applied to user interactions, where user inputs and system responses can be viewed as reactants and products, respectively.

#### User Experience Design
User experience design is grounded in theories that emphasize the importance of understanding user behaviors, motivations, and contexts. Models such as the User Experience Honeycomb and the Double Diamond framework highlight the iterative nature of design processes and the need for empathy-driven approaches. By integrating chemical principles into these frameworks, a more dynamic understanding of user interactions can be developed.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Digital Reactants and User Experience Products
This dissertation proposes the concepts of "Digital Reactants" and "User Experience Products" as analogs to chemical reactions. Digital Reactants encompass user inputs, such as clicks, gestures, and voice commands, while User Experience Products represent the outcomes of these interactions, including satisfaction, engagement, and information retention. This framework allows for the analysis of user interactions as a series of transformations, akin to chemical reactions.

#### Equilibrium in Digital Interactions
The concept of equilibrium can be applied to user interactions, where a balance is sought between user needs and system capabilities. Understanding the factors that influence this equilibrium can provide insights into optimizing user experiences, ensuring that interactions remain fluid and responsive.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines chemical reaction principles with user interaction design will be presented. This model will illustrate how the concepts of transformation, catalysis, and equilibrium interact and influence user experiences in the Spatial Web. By providing a visual representation of these interactions, the model aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play in digital environments.
