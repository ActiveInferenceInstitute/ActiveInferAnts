## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated by neuroscientists such as Karl Friston, posits that adaptive systems—whether biological or artificial—strive to minimize surprise and uncertainty through predictive modeling and active inference. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognition, perception, and action in living organisms. On the other hand, Blockchain Technology (BT), characterized by its decentralized and immutable ledger, relies on consensus mechanisms and smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent transactions. 

The intersection of FEP and BT presents a unique opportunity to enhance the adaptive capabilities of blockchain systems. By integrating cognitive science principles into the operational frameworks of decentralized networks, it is possible to create systems that not only react to changes in their environment but also predict and adapt to future states. This dissertation will explore these synergies, focusing on how FEP can inform and improve blockchain operations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its interdisciplinary approach, merging cognitive science with blockchain technology to create adaptive, predictive systems. The novelty lies in applying FEP concepts to develop a new lexicon for blockchain, such as "Predictive Ledger" and "Active Contracts," which could redefine transaction validation and smart contract functionality. By framing blockchain processes through the lens of cognitive science, this work opens new avenues for enhancing system resilience, scalability, and user engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be integrated into blockchain technology to enhance its efficiency and adaptability?
2. What novel frameworks can be developed to optimize transaction validation and smart contract performance?
3. In what ways can this integration redefine user experience and governance within decentralized systems?

The objectives of this research include developing theoretical models that integrate FEP with BT, conducting empirical investigations to validate these models, and exploring potential applications across various industries.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its origins in the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science, proposing that biological systems maintain their states by minimizing free energy through predictive coding. This principle asserts that organisms are essentially Bayesian inference machines, continuously updating their beliefs about the world based on sensory input and prior knowledge. The implications of FEP extend beyond biology, influencing fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics, where adaptive learning and decision-making are paramount.

#### Evolution of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional financial systems. Over the years, blockchain has evolved to encompass a wide range of applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These innovations have transformed industries by enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency. However, challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and governance remain prevalent, necessitating further exploration and innovation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Recent Advancements in Predictive Coding

Recent advancements in predictive coding have highlighted its applications in various domains, including perception, decision-making, and social cognition. Researchers are increasingly exploring how predictive models can be applied to artificial systems, leading to the development of intelligent agents capable of adaptive behavior. These advancements provide a rich context for integrating FEP principles into blockchain technology.

#### Current Trends in Blockchain Technology

Current trends in blockchain technology include the exploration of scalability solutions such as sharding and layer-two protocols, as well as the development of decentralized governance models. Innovations in smart contracts are also gaining traction, with a focus on enhancing their functionality and adaptability. However, the lack of interdisciplinary research combining cognitive science with blockchain presents a significant gap that this dissertation aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive science and blockchain technology represents a fertile ground for research. There is a notable lack of interdisciplinary studies that explore how principles from cognitive science, particularly those related to predictive modeling and adaptive behavior, can enhance blockchain functionality. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by proposing frameworks that leverage FEP to improve transaction validation, smart contract performance, and user experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Principles of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in several key concepts, including predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about incoming sensory information and updates these predictions based on the error between expected and actual input. Active inference extends this idea, suggesting that agents act to minimize prediction error by engaging with their environment. Variational free energy provides a mathematical framework for understanding how systems minimize surprise and uncertainty.

#### Core Components of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology is characterized by its core components, including distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Distributed ledgers ensure that all participants in a network have access to the same information, promoting transparency and trust. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, enable participants to agree on the state of the ledger. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, facilitating automated transactions without intermediaries.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Integration of Predictive Models in Transaction Validation

This dissertation proposes the integration of predictive models into transaction validation processes within blockchain systems. By leveraging predictive coding principles, blockchain networks can anticipate transaction patterns and validate them more efficiently, reducing latency and enhancing throughput. 

**Hypothesis 1**: Implementing predictive models in transaction validation will decrease transaction confirmation times by at least 30% compared to traditional validation methods.

#### Development of Adaptive Smart Contracts Informed by Active Inference

The concept of adaptive smart contracts, informed by active inference, suggests that contracts can dynamically adjust their terms based on real-time data inputs and user interactions. This adaptation can lead to more responsive and efficient contract execution, aligning with the needs of users and the context in which the contract operates.

**Hypothesis 2**: Smart contracts that utilize active inference will exhibit a 25% increase in successful execution rates in dynamic environments compared to static contracts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interaction between cognitive processes and blockchain mechanisms. This model highlights feedback loops between predictive coding and transaction validation, as well as the role of active inference in shaping adaptive governance structures. By visualizing these interactions, the model provides a framework for understanding how cognitive principles can enhance blockchain technology.
