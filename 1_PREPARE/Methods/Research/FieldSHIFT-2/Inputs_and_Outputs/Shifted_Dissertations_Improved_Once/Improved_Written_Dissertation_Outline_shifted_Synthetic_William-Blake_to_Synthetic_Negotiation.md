## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a multifaceted artist, poet, and visionary whose works reflect a profound engagement with the spiritual and socio-political issues of his time. Growing up in London, Blake was influenced by the tumultuous atmosphere of the Industrial Revolution, which shaped his views on society, religion, and the human condition. His artistic philosophy emphasized the importance of imagination as a means of transcending the limitations of rational thought. Blake's poetry, particularly in works like "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," encapsulates his belief in the dualities of human existence, illustrating the tension between opposing forces such as innocence and experience, good and evil, and reason and imagination.

#### Negotiation Practices

The field of negotiation has evolved significantly over the centuries, with roots tracing back to ancient practices of diplomacy and conflict resolution. Early negotiation theories, such as those proposed by Thomas Schelling, emphasized rational choice and game theory as the foundation for understanding negotiation dynamics. Over time, scholars have recognized the importance of emotional intelligence, communication styles, and cultural contexts in shaping negotiation outcomes. Contemporary negotiation models, such as interest-based negotiation and principled negotiation, advocate for collaborative approaches that prioritize mutual gains over adversarial tactics. However, there remains a gap in integrating artistic and philosophical insights into these frameworks, which this dissertation aims to address.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Blake's Influence

The existing literature on William Blake highlights his significant contributions to art, literature, and philosophy. Scholars have explored his impact on Romanticism, the Symbolist movement, and modern literary criticism. Blake's emphasis on imagination and the exploration of contraries has inspired various interpretations of his work, particularly in the context of human experience and creativity. However, there is a dearth of research that directly connects Blake's insights to practical applications in negotiation practices.

#### Negotiation Research

Current negotiation research primarily focuses on rational strategies, emotional dynamics, and the psychological aspects of negotiation. Scholars like Roger Fisher and William Ury have contributed to the development of interest-based negotiation, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying interests rather than positional bargaining. Emotional intelligence, as articulated by Daniel Goleman, has also emerged as a critical factor in negotiation success. Despite these advancements, there remains a limited exploration of how artistic and philosophical insights, particularly those derived from figures like Blake, can enhance negotiation practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature review reveals significant gaps in the interdisciplinary approach to negotiation studies. The integration of artistic insights, particularly those from Blake's oeuvre, presents an opportunity to enrich negotiation practices by incorporating elements of creativity, emotional resonance, and symbolic communication. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring how Blake's visionary insights can inform and transform contemporary negotiation strategies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Imagination vs. Reason

Blake's philosophy posits that imagination is a fundamental aspect of human experience, surpassing the limitations of reason. He believed that true understanding arises from the interplay between the imaginative and rational faculties. This perspective challenges the conventional negotiation models that prioritize logical reasoning and strategic calculations. By embracing imagination, negotiators can unlock creative solutions that transcend traditional boundaries, fostering a more collaborative and innovative negotiation environment.

#### Contraries

Blake's concept of contraries is central to his understanding of human experience. He argued that opposing forces are not merely in conflict but are essential for achieving a deeper understanding of truth. In the context of negotiation, this principle can be applied to acknowledge and explore opposing interests, facilitating a more nuanced dialogue between parties. By embracing contraries, negotiators can identify common ground and develop solutions that reflect the complexities of human relationships.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Visionary Negotiation

Drawing on Blake's principles, the concept of "Visionary Negotiation" emerges as a new negotiation style that prioritizes creativity and imaginative solutions. This approach encourages negotiators to engage in a process of co-creation, where diverse perspectives are valued, and innovative outcomes are sought. Visionary Negotiation emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence, fostering a deeper connection between negotiating parties.

#### Contrary Engagement

"Contrary Engagement" introduces techniques for acknowledging and exploring opposing interests in negotiations. This construct encourages negotiators to embrace the complexities of human relationships and to view conflicts as opportunities for growth and understanding. By engaging with contraries, negotiators can foster collaboration and develop solutions that reflect the richness of human experience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between Blake's principles and negotiation practices. At its core, the model emphasizes creativity, emotional intelligence, and symbolic communication as essential components of effective negotiation. The model posits that by integrating these elements, negotiators can achieve more innovative and satisfactory outcomes, ultimately redefining the negotiation process as a holistic and collaborative endeavor.
