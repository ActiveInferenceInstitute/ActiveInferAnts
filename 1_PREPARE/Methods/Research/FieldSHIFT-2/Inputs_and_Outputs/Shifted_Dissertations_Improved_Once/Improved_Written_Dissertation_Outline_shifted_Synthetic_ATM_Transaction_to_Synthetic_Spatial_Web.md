## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### ATM Transactions

The evolution of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) can be traced back to their inception in the late 1960s, with the first operational ATM introduced in 1969 in London. Initially designed to dispense cash, ATMs have undergone significant technological advancements, expanding their functionalities to include balance inquiries, fund transfers, and bill payments. The operational principles of ATMs rely on a combination of hardware, software, and secure communications protocols, which have evolved to address emerging security threats and user demands.

As technology progressed, ATMs began to incorporate features such as touchscreen interfaces, cardless transactions, and biometric authentication. These advancements have not only enhanced user convenience but have also increased the complexity of ATM security measures, necessitating ongoing research and development to mitigate risks associated with fraud and data breaches.

#### Spatial Web

The concept of the Spatial Web has emerged as a transformative force in the digital landscape, characterized by the integration of physical and digital environments through technologies such as AR, VR, and IoT. This paradigm shift enables users to interact with digital content in immersive ways, blurring the lines between the physical and virtual worlds. The Spatial Web has gained traction in various sectors, including gaming, education, and retail, but its application in the financial services sector remains relatively unexplored.

Key technologies underpinning the Spatial Web include geolocation, sensor networks, and immersive interfaces, which collectively facilitate enhanced user engagement and interaction. As users increasingly seek personalized and immersive experiences, the integration of these technologies into banking services presents an opportunity to redefine customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing research on ATM security protocols has primarily focused on traditional measures such as PIN authentication, encryption, and fraud detection systems. While these measures have proven effective in many contexts, they often fail to address the evolving nature of cyber threats and user expectations for enhanced security. Recent studies have highlighted the need for innovative security solutions that leverage emerging technologies, such as biometric authentication and blockchain, to improve transaction security and user trust.

In the realm of the Spatial Web, literature has explored the impact of immersive technologies on user engagement and decision-making. Research indicates that AR and VR can significantly enhance user experiences by providing interactive and contextually relevant information. However, there remains a lack of empirical studies examining how these technologies can be effectively integrated into financial services, particularly in the context of ATM transactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of ATM transactions within the Spatial Web presents several gaps and opportunities for research. Firstly, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of user experiences in spatial banking environments, particularly in terms of engagement, satisfaction, and security perceptions. Secondly, the development of robust security protocols that leverage emerging technologies is essential to ensure user trust in virtual banking environments. Finally, the establishment of interoperability standards is crucial to facilitate seamless transactions across diverse financial platforms, enabling users to navigate their banking services with ease.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User Experience Theory

User Experience (UX) theory encompasses principles governing user interaction and satisfaction with technology. Key concepts include usability, accessibility, and emotional engagement, which collectively influence user perceptions and behaviors. In the context of banking, understanding UX is critical for designing interfaces that meet user needs and expectations.
