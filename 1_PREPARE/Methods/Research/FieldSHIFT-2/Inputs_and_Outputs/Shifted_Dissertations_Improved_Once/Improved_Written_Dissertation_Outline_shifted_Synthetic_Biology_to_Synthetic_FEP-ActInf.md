## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Ecosystems and the Free Energy Principle represent two distinct yet increasingly relevant fields. Ecosystems are complex networks characterized by the interactions of organisms and their environments, encompassing a wide array of biotic and abiotic components that function through intricate relationships. The FEP, on the other hand, provides a theoretical framework for understanding adaptive systems in both biological and artificial contexts, positing that systems strive to minimize their free energy by predicting sensory inputs and optimizing actions based on those predictions. 

By transposing concepts from ecosystems into the FEP framework, this research seeks to bridge these domains, fostering a deeper understanding of their interconnectedness. The integration of these frameworks not only enhances ecological modeling but also enriches cognitive science, leading to a more holistic understanding of adaptive systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This dissertation will pioneer a novel approach that views ecosystems through the lens of predictive processing and active inference, challenging traditional ecological models that often emphasize equilibrium states and static interactions. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ecological dynamics by framing biodiversity not merely as a product of environmental conditions but as an inherent aspect of predictive diversity that enhances ecosystem resilience. 

Moreover, the application of active inference principles can inform conservation strategies, providing a dynamic toolset for enhancing ecosystem stability amid changing environmental conditions. This interdisciplinary approach is poised to enrich both ecological science and cognitive research, offering new insights into the mechanisms that govern complex adaptive systems. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can ecosystems be modeled as predictive systems within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
2. What are the implications of viewing biodiversity as a form of predictive diversity in ecosystem resilience?
3. How can active inference inform conservation strategies to enhance ecosystem stability?

**Testable Hypotheses:**
- H1: Ecosystems modeled as predictive systems will exhibit greater resilience to disturbances than traditional equilibrium-based models.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Dynamics

The study of ecosystems has evolved through various theoretical frameworks, beginning with foundational concepts such as energy flow and nutrient cycling. Early ecological theories focused on the linear flow of energy through trophic levels, emphasizing the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers. The concept of ecological succession introduced the idea of dynamic change over time, highlighting the importance of disturbance and recovery processes. 

Furthermore, the recognition of keystone species underscored the interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem, illustrating how certain organisms disproportionately influence community structure and function. Recent advancements in ecology have emphasized the importance of biodiversity as a critical factor in ecosystem resilience, leading to a more nuanced understanding of ecological interactions and stability.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, gaining prominence in the fields of cognitive science and theoretical biology. Proposed by Karl Friston, the FEP posits that biological systems minimize their free energy by maintaining a balance between their internal states and external environmental conditions. This principle has been applied to various domains, including neuroscience, where it offers insights into perception, action, and learning processes. 

The FEP has also been utilized to model artificial intelligence systems, providing a framework for understanding how machines can adapt to complex environments. As the FEP continues to gain traction, its potential applications in ecological contexts remain largely unexplored.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The contemporary research landscape in ecology is characterized by a growing emphasis on network theory, resilience, and the role of feedback loops in ecosystem dynamics. Studies have increasingly focused on the impacts of climate change, habitat destruction, and species invasions, highlighting the urgent need for innovative modeling approaches that incorporate these dynamic interactions. 

In parallel, the FEP has been applied to various adaptive systems, yet its integration with ecological frameworks remains limited. Current models often overlook the predictive capabilities inherent in ecosystems, which can provide valuable insights into their functioning and adaptability.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how predictive models can enhance ecological theory. Traditional ecological models often fail to account for the dynamic, non-linear interactions that characterize ecosystems. By identifying these gaps, this research presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration that combines the strengths of ecological and cognitive frameworks, paving the way for innovative research methodologies and applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theory

Ecosystem theory encompasses a range of concepts that elucidate the functioning of ecological systems. Key principles include the flow of energy through trophic levels, the cycling of nutrients, and the roles of various species in maintaining ecosystem structure and function. The concept of ecosystem resilience, defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbances while retaining its fundamental structure and processes, is particularly relevant in the context of this research. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin resilience is essential for developing effective conservation strategies.

#### FEP Theory

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the idea that living organisms strive to minimize their free energy by predicting sensory inputs and optimizing their actions accordingly. This framework emphasizes the importance of internal models that organisms use to interpret and respond to their environment. The principles of predictive processing and active inference are central to the FEP, providing a basis for understanding how organisms adapt to changing conditions and make decisions based on their predictions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Eco-Predictive Models

The integration of ecological principles with the FEP leads to the development of **eco-predictive models**, which conceptualize ecosystems as dynamic, generative systems that continuously adapt to their environments. These models emphasize the importance of feedback loops and the role of information flow in shaping ecological interactions. By framing ecosystems as predictive systems, this research aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive ecological dynamics and resilience.

#### Energetic Inference

**Energetic inference** refers to the adjustments in behavior that organisms make based on predictive assessments of resource availability. This concept highlights the interplay between energy flow and information processing, suggesting that organisms continuously update their internal models based on changes in their environment. By understanding how energetic inference operates within ecosystems, we can gain insights into the adaptive strategies employed by various species and their implications for ecosystem stability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes ecological principles with the FEP, illustrating the interdependence of energy flow and information processing in ecosystems. This model posits that ecosystems function as predictive systems that continuously adapt to environmental changes, utilizing feedback mechanisms to optimize resource allocation and species interactions. By framing ecosystems within this context, we can better understand the factors that contribute to their resilience and stability.
