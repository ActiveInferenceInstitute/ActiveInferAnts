## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

1. **Overview of Chemical Reactions and Their Foundational Principles**

   Chemical reactions are processes that lead to the transformation of reactants into products, governed by principles such as thermodynamics, kinetics, and equilibrium. Thermodynamics provides insight into the energy changes associated with reactions, while kinetics studies the rates at which these transformations occur. Equilibrium describes the state at which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in a stable system. These foundational principles will serve as a metaphorical framework for understanding Blake's artistic evolution.

   **Table 1: Key Principles of Chemical Reactions**

   | Principle      | Description                                                  |
   |----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Thermodynamics | Study of energy changes in chemical reactions                |
   | Kinetics       | Study of the rates of reactions and factors affecting them   |
   | Equilibrium    | State of balance between opposing chemical reactions         |

2. **Exploration of William Blake's Life, Artistic Development, and Philosophical Beliefs**

   William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work is characterized by its visionary quality and deep philosophical underpinnings. Blake's artistic development was influenced by his mystical experiences, political ideologies, and the socio-cultural context of 18th-century England. His belief in the power of imagination as a transformative force is central to his work, making him a pivotal figure in both the Romantic movement and the broader landscape of English literature.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

1. **Review of Existing Literature on Chemical Reactions and Their Implications**

   The study of chemical reactions has evolved significantly, with contemporary research exploring the implications of these processes in various fields, including materials science, biochemistry, and environmental science. Scholars have examined the philosophical implications of chemical transformations, particularly in relation to concepts of change and stability.

2. **Analysis of Current Interpretations of Blake's Work within Literary Studies**

   Blake's work has been the subject of extensive literary analysis, with scholars focusing on themes such as duality, imagination, and the interplay between innocence and experience. Despite this rich body of literature, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that connect Blake's artistic vision with scientific principles.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

1. **Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Approaches Linking Chemistry and Literature**

   The absence of interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate chemical principles into literary analysis presents a unique opportunity for exploration. This research seeks to fill this gap by applying concepts from chemistry to the study of Blake's work, thereby opening new avenues for understanding creativity.

2. **Exploration of the Potential for New Insights into Blake's Work through Scientific Analysis**

   By employing a scientific lens to analyze Blake's artistic evolution, this dissertation aims to uncover new insights into his creative processes. This approach not only enhances the understanding of Blake's work but also contributes to the broader discourse on the interconnectedness of the sciences and the arts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Principles of Thermodynamics, Kinetics, and Equilibrium in Chemistry**

   Thermodynamics, the study of energy and its transformations, provides a critical backdrop for understanding the changes inherent in artistic creation. Kinetics, which examines the rates of reactions, allows for an exploration of how external factors influence the pace of artistic output. Equilibrium, characterized by a balance between opposing forces, parallels the dualities present in Blake's work.

2. **Dualities and Symbolism in Blake's Poetry and Visual Art**

   Blake's oeuvre is rife with dualities, such as innocence versus experience and imagination versus reason. These dualities can be interpreted as symbolic representations of the dynamic tensions that exist within his artistic vision, mirroring the principles of equilibrium in chemical reactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Concept of "Artistic Reactants" and "Visionary Catalysis"**

   This dissertation introduces the concepts of "Artistic Reactants," which represent the influences and experiences that shape an artist's work, and "Visionary Catalysis," which refers to the transformative insights that propel the creative process. These constructs will serve as foundational elements in the analysis of Blake's artistic evolution.

2. **Development of a Framework for Understanding "Duality Equilibrium" in Artistic Expression**

   The framework of "Duality Equilibrium" posits that artistic expression is characterized by a dynamic balance between opposing forces. This concept will be employed to analyze the interplay between themes of innocence and experience in Blake's poetry and visual art.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

1. **A Model Illustrating the Parallels Between Chemical Reactions and Artistic Creation**

   This model will visually represent the connections between the principles of chemical reactions—transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, and energy changes—and the processes of artistic creation. By mapping these parallels, the dissertation will provide a comprehensive understanding of how chemical principles can be applied to analyze Blake's work.
