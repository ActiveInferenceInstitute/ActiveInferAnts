## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

PME has emerged as a critical framework in understanding predictive accuracy across disciplines. Originating in cognitive science, PME emphasizes the role of expertise in enhancing prediction capabilities. Key methodologies include knowledge synthesis, heuristic analysis, and the application of machine learning algorithms to refine predictive models. The interdisciplinary nature of PME is underscored by its applications in fields such as environmental science, economics, and healthcare, where diverse knowledge bases converge to inform decision-making processes.

#### Free Energy Principle (FEP)

The FEP, introduced by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive processing. This principle has evolved to encompass a range of applications, from neuroscience to ecological modeling. Central to FEP is the concept of active inference, where organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world based on sensory inputs and prior knowledge. This framework has profound implications for understanding adaptive behaviors and cognitive processes in living systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### PME

Recent advancements in PME have highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in enhancing predictive methodologies. Studies have shown that the integration of knowledge from disparate fields can lead to significant improvements in model accuracy and robustness. For instance, the application of PME in climate modeling has demonstrated how diverse expert inputs can refine predictions about environmental changes, underscoring the value of interdisciplinary approaches.

#### FEP

Current research on FEP has expanded its applicability beyond biological systems to include social and cognitive dimensions. Investigations into predictive processing have revealed insights into learning mechanisms and decision-making strategies in both humans and animals. The integration of FEP with computational modeling has further enriched our understanding of adaptive systems, paving the way for innovative applications in artificial intelligence and robotics.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both PME and FEP, significant gaps remain in the integration of these frameworks. The lack of interdisciplinary dialogue has hindered the development of comprehensive models that account for the complexities of adaptive systems. This research aims to identify these gaps and explore opportunities for creating interdisciplinary frameworks that enhance predictive capabilities, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of adaptive behaviors.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in PME

Cognitive flexibility is a cornerstone of PME, referring to the ability to adapt cognitive processing strategies to new and unexpected conditions. This flexibility is crucial for effective problem-solving and decision-making in complex environments. Holistic problem-solving approaches further emphasize the importance of integrating diverse perspectives and knowledge bases to enhance predictive accuracy.

#### Foundational Theories in FEP

The FEP is grounded in predictive processing and variational inference. Predictive processing posits that the brain continuously generates and updates predictions about sensory input, while variational inference provides a mathematical framework for understanding how organisms minimize free energy by optimizing their internal models of the world. These foundational theories offer a robust basis for exploring the integration of PME and FEP.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From the integration of PME and FEP, new theoretical constructs such as predictive synthesis and adaptive feedback loops emerge. Predictive synthesis refers to the process of combining diverse knowledge inputs to enhance predictive modeling, while adaptive feedback loops illustrate how organisms adjust their behaviors based on feedback from their environment. These constructs provide a framework for understanding the dynamic interplay between knowledge integration and adaptive behaviors.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between interdisciplinary knowledge integration and adaptive behaviors in living systems. This model posits that the synthesis of diverse knowledge bases enhances predictive accuracy, leading to improved cognitive flexibility and resilience in adaptive systems. By situating PME within the FEP, this framework offers a comprehensive approach to understanding complex adaptive behaviors.
