# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The **Shifted Domain** represents a pioneering fusion of negotiation and the fabric industry, where dialogue and collaboration are paramount. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a means to reach agreements, can be transposed into the fabric arts, fostering a culture of iterative design and ethical practices. This intersection opens new avenues for research and practice, allowing stakeholders to navigate complex relationships in the fabric supply chain while emphasizing sustainable and culturally sensitive approaches.

The fabric industry, historically characterized by its artisanal roots, has undergone significant transformations due to globalization, technology, and evolving consumer demands. As sustainability becomes a critical concern, the integration of negotiation strategies can provide a framework for addressing the multifaceted challenges faced by designers, manufacturers, and consumers alike. By reimagining negotiation as a collaborative dialogue, the Shifted Domain encourages a holistic approach to fabric design that prioritizes ethical sourcing, environmental stewardship, and cultural preservation.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses the urgent need for sustainability in the fabric industry by integrating negotiation strategies that promote ethical sourcing and collaboration. The fabric industry is notorious for its environmental impact, and by incorporating negotiation methodologies, stakeholders can work together to identify sustainable practices that benefit both the planet and local communities.

Secondly, it enhances the creative process in textile design by framing it as a dialogue rather than a solitary endeavor. This perspective encourages designers to engage with diverse stakeholders, including artisans, suppliers, and consumers, fostering a more inclusive and innovative design process.

Lastly, the research contributes to the theoretical foundations of both fields, offering a novel perspective on how negotiation can inform and transform fabric production. By developing new theoretical constructs and models, this dissertation aims to lay the groundwork for future interdisciplinary research that bridges negotiation studies and textile design.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The study of negotiation has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Early negotiation literature primarily focused on traditional bargaining techniques, emphasizing competitive strategies aimed at maximizing individual gain. However, scholars have increasingly recognized the importance of collaborative and integrative strategies that prioritize mutual benefit and long-term relationships. Key developments include the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes joint problem-solving, and the dual concern theory, which posits that negotiators must balance their own interests with those of their counterparts.

Similarly, the fabric industry has undergone a transformation from artisanal craftsmanship to high-tech manufacturing processes. The rise of globalization has led to complex supply chains that often prioritize cost over quality and sustainability. In response, there has been a growing emphasis on ethical sourcing, environmental impact, and the integration of technology into design processes. However, the intersection of negotiation and the fabric industry remains underexplored, highlighting a critical gap in the literature.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current negotiation literature highlights the importance of emotional intelligence, cultural awareness, and ethical considerations in achieving successful outcomes. Emotional intelligence enables negotiators to navigate interpersonal dynamics, while cultural awareness fosters sensitivity to the diverse backgrounds and values of stakeholders. Ethical considerations are increasingly recognized as essential for building trust and transparency in negotiation processes.

In contrast, the fabric industry is increasingly focused on sustainability, ethical sourcing, and the integration of technology into design processes. Initiatives such as the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and the Ethical Fashion Initiative exemplify the industry's commitment to promoting responsible practices. However, the lack of a systematic approach to integrating negotiation strategies into these initiatives presents an opportunity for further research.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a gap in understanding how negotiation can enhance collaboration in the fabric industry. While there is a growing body of work on sustainability and ethical sourcing, few studies have explored the role of negotiation as a tool for fostering collaboration and innovation. This research will capitalize on this opportunity by proposing frameworks that integrate negotiation principles into textile design and production practices. By addressing this gap, the dissertation aims to contribute to the development of a more sustainable and culturally sensitive fabric industry.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories in negotiation provide a foundation for understanding the dynamics of collaboration in the fabric industry. The **integrative bargaining model** emphasizes the importance of joint problem-solving and mutual gains. This model is particularly relevant in the context of sustainable sourcing, where stakeholders must work together to identify solutions that benefit both the environment and local communities.

The **dual concern theory** posits that negotiators must balance their own interests with those of their counterparts. This theory underscores the importance of empathy and cultural awareness in negotiation processes, especially in the context of fabric design, where diverse stakeholders may have differing priorities and values.

From the fabric industry, theories of **design thinking** and **sustainability** will be integrated into the research. Design thinking emphasizes the importance of empathy, collaboration, and iteration in the design process, aligning closely with the principles of negotiation. Sustainability theories highlight the need for responsible practices that consider environmental, social, and economic impacts.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research will propose new constructs such as **"Fabric Dialogue"** and **"Sustainable BATNA"** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement), which will serve as foundational concepts for understanding the interplay between negotiation and textile design. 

- **Fabric Dialogue** refers to the iterative communication process that occurs among stakeholders in the fabric design and production process. This construct emphasizes the importance of collaboration, empathy, and cultural sensitivity in achieving innovative and sustainable outcomes.

- **Sustainable BATNA** highlights the need for designers to identify and leverage alternative sourcing strategies that prioritize sustainability. This construct encourages stakeholders to consider the broader implications of their sourcing decisions, fostering a more responsible approach to fabric production.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the relationship between negotiation strategies, collaborative design processes, and sustainable practices in the fabric industry. This model will serve as a framework for understanding how negotiation can enhance creativity, foster ethical sourcing, and promote cultural sensitivity. By visualizing the interplay between these elements, the model aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Shifted Domain and its implications for the fabric industry.
