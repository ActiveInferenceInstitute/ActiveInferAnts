## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between healthcare and negotiation, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Both domains share core principles such as stakeholder engagement, quality outcomes, and the importance of communication. Negotiation, often perceived as a competitive and adversarial process, can benefit from the collaborative and empathetic approaches inherent in patient-centered care. This dissertation will investigate how healthcare's patient-centered approach can inform and improve negotiation practices, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and fostering more sustainable agreements.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which challenges conventional views of negotiation as purely competitive. By applying healthcare principles, this study aims to promote empathy, active listening, and collaboration in negotiations, leading to better outcomes for all parties involved. This research is not only timely but also essential, given the increasing complexity of negotiations in various sectors, including healthcare, business, and public policy. The implications of this work extend beyond academic discourse, potentially informing training programs and policy frameworks that prioritize patient-centered negotiation strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can healthcare principles enhance negotiation practices?
2. What are the key isomorphisms between patient-centered care and negotiation strategies?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these domains?
4. How can technology be leveraged to improve negotiation outcomes?
5. What are the potential impacts of a patient-centric approach on stakeholder relationships and long-term agreements?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of Healthcare Evolution and Patient-Centered Care Principles
The evolution of healthcare has witnessed a significant paradigm shift from a provider-centric model to a patient-centered approach. This transformation emphasizes the importance of understanding patients' needs, preferences, and values, which has been extensively documented in literature (McCormack et al., 2015). The principles of patient-centered care include respect for patients' autonomy, effective communication, and shared decision-making. These principles align closely with the tenets of effective negotiation, where understanding and addressing the interests of all parties are crucial.

#### Historical Development of Negotiation Theories and Practices
Negotiation theories have evolved significantly over the decades. Early models focused on distributive bargaining, where the primary goal was to claim value. However, integrative negotiation models emerged in the late 20th century, emphasizing collaboration and mutual benefit (Fisher & Ury, 1981). This shift parallels the evolution in healthcare, where the focus has moved from mere transactional interactions to collaborative partnerships. 

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Examination of Existing Literature on Patient Experience in Healthcare
Recent studies have highlighted the correlation between patient experience and health outcomes, emphasizing the necessity for healthcare providers to adopt patient-centered practices (Duncan et al., 2010). This literature underscores the importance of understanding patients' perspectives, which can be directly applied to negotiation contexts, suggesting that negotiators who prioritize stakeholder experiences may achieve more favorable outcomes.

#### Analysis of Negotiation Strategies and Their Effectiveness in Various Contexts
Negotiation literature has explored various strategies, from competitive to collaborative approaches. Research has demonstrated that negotiators who employ collaborative strategies tend to achieve better outcomes and maintain stronger relationships (Thompson, 2009). This parallels the patient-centered approach, which prioritizes long-term relationships and satisfaction over short-term gains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
#### Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research Between Healthcare and Negotiation
Despite the evident parallels between the two fields, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that integrates healthcare principles into negotiation practices. This gap presents a unique opportunity for exploration and innovation. By bridging these two domains, this research aims to fill the void and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding negotiation through a healthcare lens.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Methodologies from Both Fields
The integration of qualitative insights from healthcare with quantitative negotiation metrics offers a comprehensive approach to understanding and enhancing negotiation outcomes. This dissertation will leverage mixed-methods research to address these gaps, providing a robust analysis that combines numerical data with rich qualitative narratives.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Patient-Centered Care Theory
Patient-centered care theory emphasizes the importance of understanding patients as active participants in their own care. This approach fosters a therapeutic alliance between healthcare providers and patients, which can be mirrored in negotiation settings where trust and collaboration are paramount. The principles of active listening, empathy, and shared decision-making are integral to both domains.

#### Negotiation Theory (e.g., Fisher and Ury’s Principled Negotiation)
Fisher and Ury’s Principled Negotiation model advocates for separating people from the problem, focusing on interests rather than positions, and generating options for mutual gain. This framework aligns well with the principles of patient-centered care, which also prioritizes understanding underlying interests and fostering collaboration. The incorporation of these theories will form the backbone of the proposed Patient-Centric Negotiation Model.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### The "Patient-Centric Negotiation Model"
The "Patient-Centric Negotiation Model" emphasizes empathy and stakeholder engagement, proposing that negotiators adopt a patient-centered mindset to enhance outcomes. This model will be further developed in subsequent chapters, illustrating its practical applications and theoretical underpinnings. The model posits that by prioritizing the needs and interests of all parties, negotiators can achieve more sustainable and mutually beneficial agreements.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
#### Comprehensive Model Synthesizing Healthcare Principles with Negotiation Strategies
This section will present a comprehensive model that synthesizes healthcare principles with negotiation strategies, demonstrating their interdependence. The model will highlight key components such as empathy, active listening, and collaborative problem-solving, providing a roadmap for practitioners seeking to implement these principles in negotiation contexts. 

| Key Components          | Healthcare Principles          | Negotiation Strategies         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Empathy                 | Understanding patient needs    | Identifying interests          |
| Active Listening        | Engaging with patient feedback | Facilitating open dialogue     |
| Shared Decision-Making  | Collaborative care planning    | Generating options for mutual gain |
| Quality Outcomes        | Improving patient satisfaction  | Achieving lasting agreements   |
