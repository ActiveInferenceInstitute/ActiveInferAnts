#### Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science

Fuller’s concept of comprehensive anticipatory design science emphasizes the importance of foresight and sustainability in design processes. This approach encourages practitioners to consider the long-term implications of their decisions, fostering a mindset that prioritizes ecological and social well-being.

In the context of negotiation, anticipatory design science can inform strategies that account for potential future scenarios and their impact on stakeholders. By adopting this forward-thinking approach, negotiators can create solutions that are not only effective in the present but also sustainable in the long term.

#### Systems Theory and Synergetics

Systems theory posits that complex systems are composed of interdependent parts that interact in dynamic ways. Synergetics, a term coined by Fuller, further explores the principles of organization and coherence within systems. By applying these theories to negotiation, practitioners can better understand the interconnectedness of stakeholders and the importance of collaborative problem-solving.

The application of systems theory to negotiation highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the dynamics at play. Recognizing that negotiation outcomes are influenced by a myriad of factors can lead to more effective strategies that consider the broader context.

#### Negotiation Theories (e.g., Interest-Based Negotiation, Win-Win Strategies)

Interest-based negotiation and win-win strategies focus on identifying the underlying interests of parties involved in a negotiation. These approaches align with Fuller’s principles by promoting collaboration and mutual benefit, yet they often lack a comprehensive framework for incorporating sustainability considerations.

By integrating Fuller’s principles into existing negotiation theories, practitioners can enhance their ability to navigate complex negotiations while prioritizing sustainability and relational dynamics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Synergetic Negotiation Theory

Synergetic negotiation theory builds upon existing negotiation frameworks by integrating principles of systems thinking and collaboration. This theory emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader context of negotiations, recognizing that outcomes are not merely the result of individual actions but rather the product of complex interactions among stakeholders.

The development of synergetic negotiation theory can lead to the creation of new methodologies that enhance the effectiveness of negotiations while promoting sustainability and collaboration.

#### Tensegrity Model of Negotiation

The tensegrity model of negotiation draws from Fuller’s concept of tensegrity—structures that maintain integrity through a balance of tension and compression. In negotiation, this model advocates for flexible and adaptable agreements that can withstand changes in context and stakeholder dynamics, promoting resilience and sustainability.

By adopting the tensegrity model, negotiators can create agreements that are robust yet adaptable, allowing for adjustments in response to evolving circumstances.

#### Ephemeralization Hypothesis

Fuller’s ephemeralization hypothesis, which suggests that technological advancements can lead to more efficient resource use, can be applied to negotiation by encouraging parties to seek innovative solutions that maximize value while minimizing resource consumption. This hypothesis aligns with contemporary efforts to promote sustainable practices in various sectors.

The application of the ephemeralization hypothesis to negotiation can inspire stakeholders to explore creative solutions that enhance resource efficiency while achieving desired outcomes.
