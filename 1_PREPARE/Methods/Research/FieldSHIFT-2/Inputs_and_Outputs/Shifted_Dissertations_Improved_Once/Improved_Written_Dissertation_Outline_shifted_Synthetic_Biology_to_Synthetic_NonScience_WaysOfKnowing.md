# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Biological Ecosystems into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation investigates the transformative potential of integrating biological ecosystem concepts with non-scientific ways of knowing. By establishing a comprehensive framework that recognizes the interconnectedness, resilience, and adaptability of both domains, this research aims to create a novel knowledge ecosystem that enhances problem-solving and innovation in addressing complex global issues. The significance of this work lies in its potential to bridge the gap between scientific and non-scientific knowledge, fostering a more inclusive approach to understanding and responding to societal challenges. This study ultimately proposes a shift from a dualistic understanding of knowledge to a more integrated, holistic perspective that values the contributions of diverse epistemologies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between biology—particularly the study of ecosystems—and non-scientific ways of knowing, which encompass intuitive, experiential, and cultural knowledge systems. This convergence highlights the necessity of understanding how these diverse knowledge systems can inform and enhance one another. Biological ecosystems are characterized by intricate relationships among organisms and their environments, governed by principles of interdependence and co-evolution. Conversely, non-scientific ways of knowing, often rooted in cultural traditions and community experiences, provide valuable insights into human behavior, social dynamics, and environmental stewardship.

#### Creative Inquiry
To deepen our understanding of this intersection, we must ask: How can the principles of ecological interdependence be mirrored in the relationships between diverse knowledge systems? What mechanisms can facilitate the co-evolution of scientific and non-scientific knowledge?

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation posits that by viewing knowledge as an ecosystem, we can recognize the value of diverse perspectives and practices in fostering resilience and adaptability within communities. The novel approach of integrating scientific and non-scientific knowledge offers a fresh lens through which to examine complex social and environmental issues. This research aims to contribute to a more holistic understanding of knowledge systems, emphasizing that the interplay between different forms of knowledge can lead to innovative solutions for pressing global challenges.

#### Hypotheses
1. **H1**: The integration of biological ecosystem principles into non-scientific knowledge systems will enhance community resilience.
2. **H2**: Diverse knowledge ecosystems will yield more innovative solutions to environmental challenges than homogenous knowledge systems.
3. **H3**: Communities that actively engage in knowledge co-creation will demonstrate higher adaptability in the face of socio-environmental changes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can concepts from biological ecosystems inform and enhance non-scientific ways of knowing?
2. What are the implications of creating knowledge ecosystems for community resilience and adaptability?
3. How can this integrated framework be applied to address contemporary global challenges?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Biology and Ecosystems**: The evolution of ecosystem studies can be traced back to early observations of species interactions in natural environments. Pioneers like Charles Darwin and Alexander von Humboldt laid the groundwork for understanding biodiversity and ecological relationships. The contemporary focus on ecosystem services emphasizes the functional roles of biodiversity and the importance of maintaining ecological balance for human well-being.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Historically, non-scientific knowledge has often been undervalued in academic discourse and policy-making. Indigenous knowledge systems, for instance, have been marginalized despite their deep understanding of local ecosystems and sustainable practices. Recent movements advocating for the recognition of these knowledge forms underscore their importance in participatory research and community-based approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- In biological research, current trends emphasize the significance of ecosystem services, conservation efforts, and climate resilience. The integration of ecological data into policy frameworks has gained momentum, reflecting a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary approaches to environmental challenges.
- The acknowledgment of non-scientific knowledge is also on the rise, with movements such as community-based participatory research (CBPR) gaining traction. These approaches advocate for the inclusion of local knowledge and experiences in scientific inquiry, fostering collaborative solutions to complex issues.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the progress in both fields, there remains a notable gap in frameworks that effectively integrate scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems. This highlights the need for interdisciplinary research that respects and values diverse ways of knowing. The Shifted Domain presents an opportunity to bridge this divide, fostering collaboration and innovation through the synthesis of different knowledge forms.

| **Knowledge System**       | **Current State**                                | **Opportunities for Integration**                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Biological Ecosystems      | Focus on biodiversity and ecosystem services     | Incorporate local ecological knowledge for enhanced conservation strategies |
| Non-Scientific Knowledge    | Marginalized in policy-making                    | Leverage indigenous knowledge for community resilience and environmental stewardship |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Ecosystem Theory**: Ecosystem theory encompasses principles of interdependence, energy flow, and nutrient cycling. These principles illustrate how organisms interact with one another and their environment, forming complex networks that contribute to the overall health and stability of ecosystems.
- **Cultural Theory**: Cultural theory addresses the processes of knowledge construction, emphasizing constructivism and critical theory. Constructivism posits that knowledge is actively constructed through experiences, while critical theory critiques power dynamics in knowledge production, advocating for marginalized voices.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Knowledge Ecosystem Theory**: This emerging conceptual model frames knowledge as a dynamic, interconnected network influenced by cultural, experiential, and scientific inputs. It recognizes that knowledge is not static but evolves through interactions among diverse stakeholders, fostering resilience and adaptability in communities.

#### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interactions between biological and non-scientific knowledge systems. It emphasizes the importance of resilience, adaptability, and collaborative learning, suggesting that the integration of diverse knowledge forms can lead to more effective problem-solving strategies.

### Creative Methodological Constructs
- **Interdisciplinary Co-Creation Framework**: This framework encourages collaborative processes where scientists and community members jointly explore and develop solutions to complex issues, drawing on their respective strengths and perspectives.
