## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between cognitive security and ATM transactions. Cognitive security emphasizes safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, while ATM transactions are pivotal in modern banking, characterized by self-service and automated processes. The rapid evolution of technology has transformed how users interact with financial systems, yet this transformation has also created new vulnerabilities. As ATMs become increasingly sophisticated, understanding the cognitive biases and security challenges faced by users is crucial. This dissertation will explore how principles from cognitive security can be systematically applied to enhance the integrity and user experience of ATM transactions.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Cognitive Security Evolution and Its Foundational Theories

Cognitive security has emerged as a critical area of research in the context of information security. It focuses on protecting cognitive processes—such as perception, attention, memory, and decision-making—from manipulation and exploitation. Foundational theories in cognitive security include the Cognitive Load Theory, which posits that the amount of information a user can process simultaneously is limited. This theory is crucial for understanding how excessive cognitive load can lead to errors in decision-making, particularly in high-stakes environments such as banking.

#### Historical Development of ATM Technology and Transaction Protocols

Automated Teller Machines have undergone significant technological advancements since their inception in the late 1960s. Initially designed for simple cash withdrawals, ATMs have evolved into multifunctional devices capable of performing a variety of banking transactions, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. The development of transaction protocols has also progressed, with the introduction of encryption technologies and biometric authentication methods aimed at enhancing security. Despite these advancements, vulnerabilities remain, often stemming from user interactions with the machines.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Existing Literature on Cognitive Security Practices and Their Application in Various Domains

The literature on cognitive security encompasses various domains, including cybersecurity, behavioral economics, and human-computer interaction. Research has highlighted the significance of understanding cognitive biases—such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and overconfidence—in influencing user behavior. However, there is limited exploration of these concepts within the context of ATM transactions, indicating a pressing need for further investigation.

#### Analysis of Current ATM Security Measures, User Experiences, and Fraud Prevention Techniques

Current ATM security measures primarily focus on technological solutions, such as encryption, card skimming prevention, and surveillance systems. While these measures are essential, they often overlook the human element of security. User experiences at ATMs can be affected by cognitive biases and a lack of awareness regarding security risks. Existing literature suggests that enhancing user education and awareness is crucial for improving transaction security and reducing the likelihood of fraud.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in the Literature Regarding User Cognitive Vulnerabilities in ATM Interactions

Despite the growing body of research on cognitive security, there remains a significant gap in understanding how cognitive vulnerabilities specifically affect ATM interactions. Most studies have focused on technological aspects of ATM security, neglecting the cognitive processes that influence user behavior. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by integrating cognitive security principles into the analysis of ATM transactions.

#### Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Research Combining Cognitive Security and Banking Technology

The intersection of cognitive security and banking technology presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research. By drawing on insights from psychology, cybersecurity, and finance, this dissertation aims to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing ATM transaction security. This approach not only enriches academic discourse but also has practical implications for banking institutions seeking to improve user experiences and security measures.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory posits that individuals have a limited capacity for processing information, which can lead to cognitive overload in complex decision-making environments. In the context of ATM transactions, cognitive load can arise from various factors, including the number of options presented, the complexity of transaction processes, and the presence of security features. Understanding cognitive load is essential for designing user-friendly ATM interfaces that minimize errors and enhance decision-making.

#### Security Awareness Theory

Security Awareness Theory emphasizes the importance of user education and awareness in mitigating security risks. It posits that users who are knowledgeable about potential threats and security measures are more likely to engage in safe behaviors. In the context of ATM transactions, enhancing user awareness of security risks and best practices can significantly reduce vulnerabilities.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### ATM Cognitive Security Framework

The ATM Cognitive Security Framework integrates principles from cognitive security and ATM transaction processes. This framework highlights the importance of understanding user cognition, biases, and decision-making processes in enhancing transaction security. It emphasizes the need for user-centered design, cognitive load management, and effective education programs to mitigate vulnerabilities.

#### User Trust and Decision-Making Model in Automated Transactions

This model explores the interplay between user trust, cognitive biases, and decision-making in ATM transactions. It posits that user trust is influenced by perceived security measures, past experiences, and cognitive biases. By understanding these relationships, banking institutions can develop strategies to enhance user trust and improve transaction outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between cognitive security principles and ATM transaction processes. It highlights the importance of user education, cognitive biases, and security measures in shaping user behavior and decision-making. This model serves as a foundation for the research, guiding the exploration of cognitive vulnerabilities and their implications for ATM security.

## Core Chapters

### Key Aspect 1: Cognitive Biases in ATM Transactions

#### Sub-section 1: Identification of Common Cognitive Biases

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. In the context of ATM transactions, several biases may influence user behavior, including:

- **Confirmation Bias**: Users may seek information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs about security, ignoring contradictory evidence.
- **Anchoring**: Initial information presented at the ATM (e.g., a displayed balance) may unduly influence subsequent decisions.
- **Overconfidence**: Users may overestimate their ability to detect security threats, leading to complacency.

Understanding these biases is crucial for designing interventions that enhance user decision-making and transaction security.

#### Sub-section 2: Impact of Biases on User Behavior

Case studies illustrating how biases affect ATM transaction choices will be explored. For example, users exhibiting confirmation bias may disregard security warnings if they believe their transaction is secure based on prior experiences. Such biases can lead to increased vulnerability to fraud and security breaches. By analyzing these case studies, the dissertation will highlight the need for targeted interventions that address specific cognitive biases.
