## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality
The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the past century, moving from a purely transactional model to one that emphasizes emotional engagement and personalized service. Early hospitality practices focused on providing basic amenities; however, as competition intensified, establishments began to recognize the importance of creating memorable experiences. The rise of customer relationship management (CRM) systems in the late 20th century revolutionized the industry by enabling businesses to collect and analyze guest data, thus facilitating personalized service delivery.

#### Development of Neural Networks and Their Foundational Theories
Neural networks, inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains, have undergone significant advancements since their inception in the 1950s. Foundational theories of neural networks, including backpropagation and feedforward architectures, have paved the way for deep learning, which has transformed various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. Understanding these foundational theories is crucial for exploring how hospitality principles can be integrated into neural network design.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Analysis of Existing Research on Personalization in Hospitality
Existing research highlights the critical role of personalization in enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty. Studies have demonstrated that tailored experiences lead to higher levels of emotional engagement, which in turn fosters repeat business and positive word-of-mouth. The incorporation of technology, such as mobile applications and data analytics, has further empowered hospitality providers to deliver personalized experiences at scale.

#### Examination of Advancements in Neural Network Technology and Their Applications
Recent advancements in neural network technology, particularly in deep learning, have enabled significant improvements in machine learning applications. These advancements have led to increased accuracy in tasks such as image and speech recognition, as well as the development of generative models that can create new content. However, the application of these technologies in user-centric domains, such as hospitality, remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
#### Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research Between Hospitality and Neural Networks
Despite the growing importance of both fields, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges hospitality and neural networks. This gap presents an opportunity to explore how principles from hospitality can enhance neural network design, leading to more adaptive and personalized AI systems.

#### Exploration of the Potential Benefits of Merging These Two Fields
Merging hospitality principles with neural network design can yield numerous benefits, including improved user satisfaction, increased operational efficiency, and the development of more sustainable AI practices. By leveraging insights from both domains, this research aims to create a framework that enhances the overall user experience while addressing the challenges faced by the hospitality industry.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Theories of Service Quality and Guest Experience
Theories such as the SERVQUAL model, which measures service quality based on dimensions like tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, provide a robust framework for understanding guest experiences. These dimensions can inform the design of neural networks by establishing metrics for evaluating their performance in terms of user satisfaction and engagement.

#### Principles of Neural Communication and Learning
The principles of neural communication, including synaptic plasticity and reinforcement learning, offer valuable insights into how neural networks can adapt to user preferences. By understanding how learning occurs in biological systems, we can develop neural networks that are more responsive to changes in user behavior and preferences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Concept of "Neural Personalization" as an Adaptive Learning Mechanism
The concept of "Neural Personalization" posits that neural networks can be designed to adaptively learn from user-specific data, thereby enhancing their ability to deliver personalized experiences. This construct emphasizes the importance of user data in shaping neural network behavior, allowing for more tailored interactions.

#### "Synaptic Service Quality" as a Measure of Neural Efficiency
"Synaptic Service Quality" refers to the efficiency of neural communication and processing within neural networks. By applying service quality metrics to neural networks, we can evaluate their performance in terms of responsiveness, adaptability, and overall user satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model combines hospitality principles with neural network design, creating a framework that emphasizes personalization, service quality, and sustainability. This model serves as the foundation for the research questions and hypotheses explored in this dissertation.
