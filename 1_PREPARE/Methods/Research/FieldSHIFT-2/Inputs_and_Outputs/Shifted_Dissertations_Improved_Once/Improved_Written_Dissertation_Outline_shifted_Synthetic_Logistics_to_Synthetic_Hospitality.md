## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Logistics as a Discipline

Logistics has evolved significantly since its inception, transitioning from a military-focused discipline to a vital component of global supply chains. Foundational theories such as Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Lean Management have established the importance of efficiency, responsiveness, and customer satisfaction within logistics. SCM emphasizes the interconnectedness of various stakeholders in the supply chain, while Lean Management focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value. These principles have shaped contemporary logistics practices, making them applicable across various sectors, including hospitality.

#### Examination of the Hospitality Industry's Development

The hospitality industry has a rich history, characterized by its evolution from traditional inns and taverns to modern hotels and resorts. The importance of guest experience has become paramount, with service quality, personalization, and technological integration playing critical roles in attracting and retaining customers. Recent trends indicate a shift towards experiential hospitality, where guests seek not only quality service but also unique and memorable experiences. This evolution necessitates innovative approaches to service delivery, making the integration of logistics principles particularly relevant.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Summary of Contemporary Research in Logistics

Recent research in logistics has focused on several key areas, including efficiency optimization, data utilization, and customer-centric approaches. The advent of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence has transformed logistics operations, enabling real-time tracking, predictive analytics, and enhanced decision-making. These advancements have significant implications for customer satisfaction, as logistics plays a critical role in ensuring timely and accurate service delivery.

#### Analysis of Current Trends in Hospitality

In the hospitality sector, current trends emphasize service quality, technology integration, and sustainability. The rise of online booking platforms, mobile applications, and personalized marketing strategies has reshaped guest interactions, requiring hospitality businesses to adopt a more data-driven approach. Additionally, sustainability has become a focal point, with guests increasingly favoring establishments that prioritize environmental responsibility. These trends highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of how logistics principles can enhance operational efficiency and guest experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both logistics and hospitality, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the intersection of these two fields. Existing research often treats logistics and hospitality as separate domains, overlooking the potential for integration. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring the opportunities for interdisciplinary research and practical applications, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how logistics principles can enhance guest experience management.

## Theoretical Framework
