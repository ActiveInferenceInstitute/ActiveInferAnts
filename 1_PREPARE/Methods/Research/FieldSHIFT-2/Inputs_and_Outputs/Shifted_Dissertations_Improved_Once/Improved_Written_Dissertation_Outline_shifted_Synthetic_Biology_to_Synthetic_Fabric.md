## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of ecosystem science with the fabric industry and arts represents an unprecedented opportunity to rethink production and design practices. Ecosystems are characterized by complex interactions among living organisms and their environments, while the fabric industry faces challenges related to sustainability and ethical production. This dissertation investigates how principles from ecosystems can inform and enhance practices within the fabric industry, thereby creating a robust model for sustainable development that transcends traditional boundaries.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in the fabric industry by applying ecological principles. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecosystem concepts to create a new theoretical framework—Textile Ecosystems—that highlights the interdependence of stakeholders and the importance of diversity in promoting resilience. By establishing this framework, the dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ecological principles can lead to innovative practices in the fabric industry, ultimately redefining the relationship between textiles and the environment.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
Ecosystem science has evolved significantly over the past century, with foundational theories emerging from ecological studies that emphasize the interdependence of species and their environments. Key principles such as energy flow, nutrient cycling, and population dynamics form the backbone of ecological research. Concurrently, the fabric industry has undergone substantial transformations, from the industrial revolution's mechanization to the contemporary focus on sustainability. Historical milestones, such as the rise of organic cotton and the adoption of fair trade practices, illustrate the industry's gradual shift towards more responsible production methods.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary research in ecosystem dynamics emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and resilience in maintaining healthy ecosystems. Scholars such as Folke (2006) have highlighted the adaptive capacity of ecosystems in the face of environmental change. In the fabric industry, there is a growing body of literature addressing sustainability, with studies focusing on technological innovations, consumer demand for eco-friendly products, and ethical production practices. However, the integration of ecological principles into textile practices remains underexplored, indicating a critical gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The current literature reveals significant gaps in the application of ecological concepts to the fabric industry. While there is extensive research on sustainability, a comprehensive framework that incorporates ecosystem dynamics into textile production is lacking. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring interdisciplinary research opportunities and fostering collaboration between ecologists, textile designers, and industry stakeholders.

| Gap in Literature                     | Opportunity for Research                         |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of ecological frameworks in textiles | Development of Textile Ecosystems model         |
| Limited interdisciplinary studies      | Collaborative projects between ecologists and designers |
| Insufficient empirical data on sustainability impacts | Comprehensive case studies on sustainable practices |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Key ecological theories such as resilience theory and biodiversity theory provide a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of ecosystems. Resilience theory, as articulated by Holling (1973), posits that ecosystems have the capacity to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change. Biodiversity theory emphasizes the role of species diversity in enhancing ecosystem stability and productivity. In the context of the fabric industry, sustainability theories such as the triple bottom line approach highlight the need for economic viability, environmental health, and social equity.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The Theory of Textile Ecosystems emerges as a novel construct that synthesizes ecological principles with textile practices. This theory posits that the fabric industry functions as an ecosystem characterized by diverse stakeholders, resource flows, and interdependent relationships. Additionally, the Sustainability as a Symbiotic Relationship framework suggests that sustainable practices arise from collaborative interactions among designers, manufacturers, consumers, and the environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated theoretical model will be visually represented, illustrating the interactions among stakeholders, diversity, and resource management in the fabric industry. This model serves as a conceptual tool for understanding the complex dynamics of Textile Ecosystems and guiding future research and practice.
