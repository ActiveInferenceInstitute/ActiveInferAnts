# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Quantum Computation and the Free Energy Principle, which explains how biological systems maintain their organization and adapt to their environments. This convergence offers an unprecedented opportunity to rethink adaptive systems through the lens of quantum mechanics, enabling a deeper understanding of both cognitive and biological processes.

Quantum Computation is fundamentally rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics, which delineate the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales. Unlike classical computation, which relies on binary states (0s and 1s), quantum computation employs qubits that can exist in superposition, allowing them to represent multiple states simultaneously. This capability enables quantum computers to solve complex problems with exponential efficiency compared to classical counterparts. The Free Energy Principle, conversely, posits that biological systems strive to minimize their free energy, thus maintaining their organization and adapting to changing environments. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognition, perception, and decision-making processes in living organisms.

By integrating these two domains, the research presented in this dissertation aims to illuminate how quantum principles can inform our understanding of adaptability in cognitive and biological systems, leading to a richer comprehension of intelligence and decision-making.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

By integrating quantum principles with the FEP, the research challenges traditional models of cognition and decision-making, proposing that the principles of quantum computation can inform our understanding of generative models and predictive coding in living organisms. 

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging quantum mechanics and cognitive science. It posits that quantum-inspired generative models can enhance the adaptability of artificial intelligence systems in dynamic environments. Furthermore, it explores the implications of entangled predictions for social cognition and collective behavior, suggesting that quantum mechanics can offer insights into the complexities of human interaction and decision-making.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Quantum Computation

The development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century laid the groundwork for quantum computation. Key milestones include:

- **Shor's Algorithm**: Developed by Peter Shor in 1994, this algorithm demonstrated that quantum computers could factor large integers exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. This breakthrough highlighted the potential of quantum computation in cryptography and information security.

- **Grover's Algorithm**: Introduced by Lov Grover in 1996, this algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, showcasing the efficiency of quantum algorithms in solving complex problems.

- **Quantum Error Correction**: As quantum systems are prone to decoherence and noise, the development of quantum error correction codes, such as the Shor code and the surface code, has been pivotal in ensuring the reliability of quantum computations.

### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its origins in the laws of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy in statistical mechanics. Key concepts include:

- **Variational Free Energy**: This concept describes the difference between the true distribution of states in a system and an approximate distribution. It forms the basis for understanding how biological systems minimize free energy.

- **Active Inference**: This framework posits that organisms actively sample their environments to minimize surprise, thereby maintaining their internal states and adapting to external changes.

- **Predictive Coding**: This theory suggests that the brain operates as a predictive machine, constantly generating predictions about sensory input and updating these predictions based on incoming data.
