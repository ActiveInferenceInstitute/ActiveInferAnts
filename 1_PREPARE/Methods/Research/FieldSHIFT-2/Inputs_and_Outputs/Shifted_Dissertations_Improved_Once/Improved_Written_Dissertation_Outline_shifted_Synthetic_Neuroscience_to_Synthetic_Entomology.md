## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

The evolution of neural network theory traces back to the early 1940s when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced the concept of artificial neurons. Subsequent developments, such as the perceptron model by Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950s, laid the groundwork for modern neural networks. Key milestones include the backpropagation algorithm introduced in the 1980s, which enabled the training of multi-layer networks, and the rise of deep learning in the 2010s, which has revolutionized AI applications across various domains.

#### Insect Behavior

The study of insect behavior has a rich history, beginning with foundational studies by pioneers such as Charles Darwin and Karl von Frisch. Research has primarily focused on social behaviors, communication strategies, and ecological roles of insects. Notable contributions include the discovery of pheromonal communication in ants and bees, which has provided insights into the mechanisms of social organization and decision-making in insect colonies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in neural networks, particularly in deep learning, have led to breakthroughs in AI applications, including autonomous systems and predictive modeling. In the realm of insect behavior, current research emphasizes chemical communication, social dynamics, and the ecological implications of insect interactions. However, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these two fields, presenting an opportunity for innovative exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research linking neural network theory to insect behavior highlights the need for a comprehensive framework that integrates insights from both domains. By applying computational modeling techniques to biological systems, this research aims to uncover new patterns and behaviors that can inform both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neural Network Theory

Key concepts in neural network theory include interconnected systems, synaptic plasticity, and decision-making mechanisms. Interconnected systems refer to the network of neurons that communicate through synapses, where synaptic plasticity describes the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, influencing learning and memory. Decision-making mechanisms in neural networks often involve activation functions that determine the output based on the input signals.

#### Insect Social Theory

Insect social theory encompasses the study of social structures, communication, and ecological roles of insects. Social insects exhibit complex hierarchical organizations, with roles differentiated by tasks such as foraging, brood care, and defense. Communication among individuals is primarily mediated by pheromones, which convey information about food sources, nest conditions, and threats.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The concept of "Insect Neural Networks" emerges as a framework for understanding collective behavior in insect societies. This construct posits that individual insects function as nodes within a network, where their interactions and communications mirror neural connections in biological networks. Furthermore, the idea of "Pheromonal Modulation" parallels neurotransmitter dynamics, suggesting that pheromones play a crucial role in influencing behavior and decision-making within colonies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes principles from neural networks and insect behavior, illustrating how individual actions lead to collective intelligence. This model posits that the flow of information within insect colonies can be represented as a neural network, where pheromonal signals act as modulators of behavior, akin to neurotransmitters in neural circuits. By understanding these dynamics, researchers can gain insights into the emergent properties of social insect behavior.
