## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain

Blockchain technology emerged in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, a digital currency designed to operate without a central authority. Its foundational principles—decentralization, transparency, and security—have led to its adoption across various industries. Key technological advancements include the development of consensus algorithms, such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, which ensure the integrity of transactions within the network. The application of blockchain has expanded to include smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and supply chain management, demonstrating its versatility and potential for innovation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in blockchain technology focuses on enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability among decentralized systems. Studies on consensus mechanisms have yielded insights into optimizing transaction speeds and reducing energy consumption. In the realm of Hymenoptera, investigations into collective behavior have revealed the significance of social interactions and environmental cues in decision-making processes. However, there remains a gap in interdisciplinary research that combines insights from blockchain technology with biological systems, particularly in the context of social insects.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

By applying blockchain concepts to the study of Hymenoptera, this dissertation aims to fill the existing gaps in knowledge and provide a framework for understanding the complexities of collective intelligence and resource management in social insects. The research could also lead to the formulation of new hypotheses regarding the evolutionary advantages of decentralized decision-making in both biological and technological contexts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blockchain Theory

Blockchain theory encompasses principles of decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic security. Decentralization allows for distributed control, reducing the risk of single points of failure. Consensus mechanisms, such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance, ensure agreement among participants in a network, while cryptographic security safeguards data integrity and confidentiality. These principles can be applied to model decision-making processes in social insects, where decentralized communication and collective agreement are paramount.

#### Social Insect Theory

Social insect theory explores the dynamics of collective behavior, communication, and resource allocation within colonies. Theories such as the Self-Organization Theory and the Social Insect Theory emphasize the importance of local interactions among individuals in shaping emergent group behaviors. Pheromone communication plays a crucial role in coordinating activities such as foraging and nest building, providing a parallel to blockchain's transaction validation processes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes a new theoretical framework that integrates blockchain principles with the social structures of Hymenoptera. By conceptualizing pheromone trails as decentralized communication channels and decision-making processes as consensus mechanisms, this framework seeks to illuminate the parallels between biological and technological systems. 

| **Proposed Theoretical Constructs**             |
|------------------------------------------------|
| Pheromone Trails as Communication Channels     |
| Consensus Mechanisms in Ant Decision-Making    |
| Resource Allocation as Smart Contracts          |
