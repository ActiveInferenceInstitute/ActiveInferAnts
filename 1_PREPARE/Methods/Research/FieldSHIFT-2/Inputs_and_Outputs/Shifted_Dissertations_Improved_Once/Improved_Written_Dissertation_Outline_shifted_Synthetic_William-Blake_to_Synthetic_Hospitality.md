## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

This section provides a detailed exploration of William Blake's life, his artistic philosophy, and his contributions to literature and visual art. Blake, an English poet, painter, and printmaker, is often considered a precursor to the Romantic movement. His work is characterized by a profound exploration of the human condition, imagination, and the interplay of opposites, which he referred to as "contraries." Blake's vision of a world where the spiritual and material coexist harmoniously serves as a rich source of inspiration for contemporary practices in hospitality.

In parallel, the evolution of the hospitality industry reveals a significant shift toward guest-centered service models. Historically, hospitality was primarily concerned with providing basic accommodations and sustenance. However, the late 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a transformation, with a growing emphasis on creating unique and memorable experiences for guests. This shift is influenced by changing consumer expectations, technological advancements, and an increased understanding of the psychological and emotional dimensions of service.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An overview of contemporary research in both literary studies, particularly focusing on Blake, and hospitality management will be presented. In literary studies, Blake's work has been analyzed through various lenses, including psychoanalytic, feminist, and post-colonial perspectives. Scholars have emphasized the importance of imagination and creativity in Blake's poetry and art, which can inform contemporary discussions about emotional engagement and experience.

In hospitality management, recent research has focused on personalization, technology integration, and the importance of guest experience. Studies have shown that guests increasingly seek personalized services that cater to their individual preferences and needs. Furthermore, the integration of technology in hospitality, such as mobile apps and artificial intelligence, has transformed the way guests interact with service providers. However, despite the advancements in these areas, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate artistic and philosophical insights into practical applications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying gaps in current hospitality research, particularly the lack of interdisciplinary approaches, highlights the need for innovative frameworks that incorporate artistic and philosophical insights into practical applications. By exploring the intersection of Blake's concepts and hospitality practices, this dissertation aims to address these gaps and provide a comprehensive understanding of how artistic principles can enhance guest experiences. The opportunity to integrate Blake's visionary ideas into hospitality offers a fresh perspective on enhancing emotional engagement and satisfaction, ultimately contributing to a more holistic approach to guest experience management.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

This section outlines key theories from both Blake's work and hospitality management. Blake's concept of contraries posits that oppositional forces are essential for understanding the human experience. This idea can be applied to hospitality by examining how contrasting elements—such as luxury and simplicity, technology and personal interaction—can coexist to create a richer guest experience.

In hospitality management, theories related to service quality and customer satisfaction provide a foundation for understanding guest experiences. The SERVQUAL model, for example, identifies key dimensions of service quality, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. By integrating Blake's philosophical insights with established hospitality theories, this dissertation seeks to develop a new framework for understanding and enhancing guest experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

New constructs will be developed, including the "Dual Experience Framework" and "Imaginative Engagement Theory." The Dual Experience Framework emphasizes the importance of balancing contrasting elements in guest experiences, while Imaginative Engagement Theory explores the role of creativity and artistic expression in fostering emotional connections. These constructs will serve as the basis for the proposed model, providing a theoretical foundation for the practical applications discussed in subsequent sections.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will be presented, illustrating how Blake's principles can be systematically applied to enhance guest experiences. This model will incorporate elements of the Dual Experience Framework and Imaginative Engagement Theory, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding and improving guest satisfaction and emotional engagement in hospitality settings.
