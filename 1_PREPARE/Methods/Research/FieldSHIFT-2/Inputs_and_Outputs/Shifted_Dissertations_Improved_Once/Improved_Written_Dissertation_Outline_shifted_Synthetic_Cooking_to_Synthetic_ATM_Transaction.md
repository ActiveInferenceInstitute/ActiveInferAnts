## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Culinary Arts

The evolution of culinary techniques can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where the preparation and presentation of food were integral to cultural identity and social rituals. The focus on user experience in culinary arts has grown significantly, with the rise of gastronomy emphasizing sensory engagement, creativity, and the emotional connection between food and the consumer. Modern culinary practices, influenced by molecular gastronomy and fusion cuisine, prioritize not only taste but also the overall dining experience, including aesthetics and ambiance.

#### Banking Technology

The historical development of ATMs began in the late 1960s, revolutionizing banking by providing customers with self-service options for cash withdrawals and balance inquiries. Over the decades, ATMs have evolved to include various functionalities such as deposits, transfers, and bill payments. The importance of user interaction and security has been paramount, with advancements in technology leading to enhanced security measures, biometric authentication, and user-friendly interfaces. However, despite these advancements, user experience often remains underexplored, presenting an opportunity for innovation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in user experience design in both culinary and banking domains have highlighted the importance of sensory engagement and emotional connection. In culinary arts, research has shown that sensory experiences significantly impact consumer satisfaction and decision-making. Similarly, in banking technology, user experience design has gained traction, with a focus on creating intuitive interfaces that cater to user needs. However, the intersection of these domains remains largely unexplored, indicating a gap in the literature and a potential area for innovative research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in user experience within ATM transactions presents opportunities for improvement through culinary-inspired design. Current ATM interfaces often lack the sensory engagement and personalization that characterize successful culinary experiences. By examining user interactions and preferences through the lens of culinary principles, this research aims to uncover new design methodologies that enhance user satisfaction and efficiency in banking transactions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Experience Theory

Culinary Experience Theory posits that sensory engagement, including taste, smell, sight, and touch, significantly influences user satisfaction. The preparation methods, presentation, and ambiance surrounding food consumption create a holistic experience that resonates with consumers. This theory emphasizes the importance of emotional connections and personal preferences, which can be applied to the design of user interfaces in banking technology.

#### User Experience Design Principles

Established theories in user experience design, particularly in banking technology, focus on usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. Key principles include user-centered design, iterative testing, and the importance of feedback mechanisms. These principles guide the development of interfaces that facilitate efficient and secure transactions while prioritizing user needs.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Banking Theory

Culinary Banking Theory proposes a new framework that combines culinary principles with banking technology to enhance user experience. This theory emphasizes the importance of sensory engagement, personalization, and preparation techniques in creating a more enjoyable and efficient banking experience. By integrating culinary concepts into ATM design, this framework seeks to redefine user interactions and satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model illustrates the interaction between culinary concepts and ATM design. It encompasses sensory engagement, user preferences, and transaction preparation, highlighting how these elements can be synergistically combined to enhance user experience. This model serves as a foundation for the subsequent research and experimentation outlined in this dissertation.

| Element                  | Culinary Concept         | ATM Design Application         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Sensory Engagement      | Flavor, Aroma           | Tactile feedback, Visual cues |
| Personalization         | Customizable dishes      | User-defined transaction settings |
| Preparation Techniques   | Mise en place           | Pre-selection of common transactions |
