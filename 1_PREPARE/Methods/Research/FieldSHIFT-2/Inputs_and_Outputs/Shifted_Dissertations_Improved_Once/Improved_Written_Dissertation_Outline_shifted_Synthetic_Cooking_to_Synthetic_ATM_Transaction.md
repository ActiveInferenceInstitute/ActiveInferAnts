## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a pioneering integration of culinary arts and banking technology, with a particular focus on ATM transactions. Culinary arts emphasize sensory engagement, meticulous organization, and an immersive user experience, while banking technology prioritizes efficiency, security, and user interaction. This dissertation endeavors to bridge the gap between these two distinct fields, applying culinary principles to enhance the ATM experience. 

Historically, ATMs have been designed with a predominant focus on functionality and security, often at the expense of user experience. Conversely, culinary arts thrive on creating immersive and engaging experiences that stimulate the senses. By examining the intersection of these domains, this research aims to redefine the design and functionality of ATMs, striving to make them not only more user-friendly but also enjoyable.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its challenge to traditional views of banking technology by applying creative, sensory-driven principles from culinary arts. The novelty of this work is rooted in the systematic transposition of culinary concepts to enhance user experience in banking, creating a framework adaptable across various technological interfaces. This interdisciplinary approach enriches ATM design while simultaneously opening new avenues for collaboration between culinary experts and banking technologists.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Culinary Arts

The evolution of culinary techniques has consistently emphasized user experience. From the primitive days of cooking, where sustenance was the primary goal, to the contemporary culinary arts that prioritize presentation, taste, and sensory engagement, the field has undergone a profound transformation. The concept of "mise en place," which involves organizing ingredients and tools before cooking, serves as a foundational principle in culinary arts that can be transposed to user experience design.

#### Banking Technology

The historical development of ATMs dates back to the 1960s, with the first functional ATM introduced in 1967. Initially designed to provide basic banking services, ATMs have evolved to encompass a variety of functionalities, including cash withdrawal, deposits, and account inquiries. However, the emphasis on user interaction and security has often overshadowed the importance of user experience. Recent advancements in banking technology have begun to prioritize user-centered design, yet there remains a significant gap in integrating sensory and experiential elements.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in user experience design in both culinary and banking domains highlight innovative methodologies that prioritize user engagement. In culinary arts, techniques such as molecular gastronomy and immersive dining experiences have emerged, emphasizing the importance of sensory engagement. Similarly, in banking technology, there has been a growing acknowledgment of the need for intuitive interfaces and personalized user experiences. However, the intersection of these fields remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in user experience within ATM transactions presents opportunities for improvement through culinary-inspired design. By analyzing user interactions with ATMs and understanding their preferences, this research aims to propose design modifications that enhance user satisfaction and efficiency.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Experience Theory

Culinary Experience Theory examines how sensory engagement and preparation methods impact user satisfaction. This theory posits that the overall experience of a meal is shaped not only by the taste and presentation of food but also by the environment and the emotional context in which it is consumed. This theory can be adapted to explore how sensory feedback and aesthetic design in ATMs influence user satisfaction.

#### User Experience Design Principles

Established theories in user experience design within banking technology emphasize the importance of usability, accessibility, and user-centered design. These principles highlight the need for interfaces that are intuitive and responsive to user needs, which can be further enhanced by incorporating culinary concepts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Banking Theory

Culinary Banking Theory proposes a new framework that combines culinary principles with banking technology to enhance user experience. This theory suggests that by applying culinary techniques—such as sensory engagement, organization, and personalization—banking interfaces can be transformed to create more enjoyable and efficient user interactions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model illustrates the interaction between culinary concepts and ATM design. This model posits that sensory engagement, organized interfaces, and personalized experiences collectively contribute to enhanced user satisfaction and efficiency in ATM transactions.
