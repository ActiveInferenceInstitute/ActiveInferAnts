## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of ecology and literature, particularly within the works of William Blake, represents a novel interdisciplinary domain that challenges the conventional boundaries of literary criticism. This shift enables a fresh perspective on Blake's exploration of human experience, spirituality, and societal critique, framed through ecological principles such as interconnectedness, resilience, and biodiversity. By employing an ecological lens, the research illuminates how Blake’s themes resonate with contemporary environmental concerns, thereby enhancing the relevance of his work in today's ecological discourse. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional literary analysis by introducing ecological frameworks, offering a new lens through which to interpret Blake's work. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecosystem dynamics into literary analysis, fostering a deeper understanding of Blake's thematic complexity. By bridging the gap between ecology and literature, this dissertation not only contributes to Blake scholarship but also advocates for a more holistic understanding of human experiences that acknowledges the intricate relationships between individuals and their environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. **How can ecological principles illuminate the interconnected themes in Blake's work?**
2. **In what ways do Blake's characters exemplify resilience akin to ecological systems?**
3. **What new theoretical constructs emerge from viewing Blake’s oeuvre through an ecological lens?**

These questions guide the exploration of Blake's work, aiming to reveal the rich tapestry of ideas that connect his artistic output with ecological dynamics.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical development of ecological principles has roots in various scientific disciplines, particularly biology and environmental science. Key concepts such as ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecological resilience have evolved over time, influenced by thinkers ranging from Darwin to contemporary ecologists. Concurrently, Blake's life and work emerged during the Romantic period, characterized by a profound engagement with nature, spirituality, and social critique. His poetry and visual art often reflect a dichotomy between innocence and experience, encapsulating a complex relationship with the natural world.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent scholarship in ecology emphasizes the importance of understanding human interactions with the environment, advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that includes the humanities. In literary studies, Blake scholarship has predominantly focused on thematic analysis, historical context, and formalist critiques. However, there is a notable lack of engagement with ecological frameworks, which limits the potential for deeper insights into Blake's work. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by synthesizing ecological principles with literary analysis.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of ecology and literature presents significant gaps, particularly in the analysis of how literary texts can reflect and influence ecological understanding. Opportunities for interdisciplinary research abound, as scholars can draw upon ecological dynamics to enrich literary analysis, and vice versa. This research aims to explore these opportunities by examining the implications of viewing Blake's work through an ecological lens, thereby contributing to the burgeoning field of ecoliterature.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key ecological theories, such as systems theory and resilience theory, provide a foundation for understanding the dynamics of ecosystems. Systems theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of various components within an ecosystem, while resilience theory focuses on the capacity of systems to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change. In literary studies, theories relevant to Blake include Romanticism, which celebrates nature and the sublime, and post-structuralism, which interrogates the stability of meaning in texts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces the concept of the "ecosystem of ideas" as a framework for analyzing Blake's work. This construct posits that Blake's themes and motifs interact dynamically, similar to the relationships found within ecological systems. Additionally, the concept of "trophic cascades of influence" is developed to describe the impact of key texts on subsequent literary movements, illustrating how Blake's work has shaped and been shaped by the literary ecosystem.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines ecological dynamics with literary analysis is proposed, emphasizing interconnectedness and resilience. This model allows for a comprehensive examination of Blake's work, revealing the intricate relationships among themes, characters, and the broader cultural context in which he operated.
