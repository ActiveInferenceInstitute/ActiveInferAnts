## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the decades. Initially, hospitality focused primarily on the physical aspects of service delivery, such as comfort and cleanliness. However, as competition intensified, the industry began to recognize the importance of emotional connections and personalized services. Recent studies have emphasized the role of technology, such as mobile applications and AI, in enhancing guest experience by providing tailored recommendations and seamless interactions. 

#### Development of the Free Energy Principle and Its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle, first articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy, which can be understood as a measure of surprise or prediction error. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognition and behavior, suggesting that organisms actively infer and adapt to their environments. The foundational theories of the FEP, including active inference and predictive coding, provide a framework for understanding how individuals process information and make decisions based on their experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Existing Literature on Guest Experience Strategies and Their Effectiveness

Current literature highlights various strategies employed by hospitality organizations to enhance guest experience, including personalization, service quality, and technological advancements. Studies have shown that personalized services significantly improve guest satisfaction, while high service quality is correlated with positive guest reviews and repeat business. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate cognitive science principles into these strategies. 

#### Examination of the Current Applications of the Free Energy Principle in Cognitive Science and Biology

The FEP has been applied across various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and robotics, to explain adaptive behavior. Its application in cognitive science has provided insights into how individuals form expectations and update beliefs based on new information. Nevertheless, its potential applications in hospitality remain largely unexplored, presenting a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Current Hospitality Research Regarding Cognitive Frameworks

Despite the recognition of the importance of guest experience, there is a notable absence of research that applies cognitive frameworks, such as the FEP, to hospitality practices. This gap limits the industryâ€™s ability to fully understand and anticipate guest behavior, hindering the development of innovative strategies that could enhance overall satisfaction.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Integrating FEP Concepts into Hospitality Practices

The integration of FEP concepts into hospitality practices presents numerous opportunities for enhancing guest experience. By understanding guest interactions through the lens of predictive coding and active inference, hospitality professionals can develop more effective strategies for personalization, service quality, and technology integration.

| **Identified Gaps** | **Opportunities** |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Lack of cognitive frameworks in hospitality research | Integration of FEP principles into guest experience strategies |
| Limited understanding of guest behavior dynamics | Development of predictive models for anticipating guest needs |
| Insufficient focus on sustainability practices | Framing sustainability through entropy minimization |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Theories of Guest Experience: Personalization, Service Quality, and Technology Integration

Theories surrounding guest experience emphasize the importance of personalization, service quality, and the integration of technology. Personalization involves tailoring services to meet individual guest preferences, while service quality pertains to the overall delivery of services that meet or exceed expectations. Technology integration plays a crucial role in facilitating these processes, enabling real-time data collection and analysis to enhance guest interactions.

#### Key Concepts of the Free Energy Principle: Active Inference, Predictive Coding, and Entropy Minimization

The key concepts of the Free Energy Principle include active inference, which suggests that individuals actively seek to minimize prediction errors by updating their beliefs based on new evidence. Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and adjusts these predictions based on actual experiences. Entropy minimization refers to the tendency of systems to move towards states of lower uncertainty, which can be applied to understanding guest satisfaction in hospitality contexts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of the Predictive Guest Model

The Predictive Guest Model is an innovative construct that leverages the principles of active inference and predictive coding to understand guest behavior. This model posits that guests form expectations based on previous experiences and actively seek to minimize prediction errors through their interactions with hospitality services. By understanding these dynamics, hospitality professionals can better anticipate guest needs and preferences.

**Hypothesis**: Guests with a higher level of personalization in their experiences report lower levels of surprise and higher satisfaction.

#### Conceptualization of Entropy-Driven Guest Satisfaction

Entropy-Driven Guest Satisfaction is a theoretical construct that frames guest satisfaction as a function of entropy minimization. This concept suggests that guests derive satisfaction from experiences that align with their expectations and reduce uncertainty. By focusing on practices that minimize entropy, such as personalized services and transparent communication, hospitality organizations can enhance overall guest satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines guest experience principles with FEP constructs, illustrating how they interact to enhance hospitality outcomes. This model posits that by understanding guest interactions as adaptive processes governed by predictive coding and active inference, hospitality professionals can develop more effective strategies for personalization, service quality, and technology integration. The model serves as a framework for future research and practical applications in the hospitality industry.
