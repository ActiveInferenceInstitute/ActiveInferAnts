## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Traditional Knowledge

Traditional knowledge encompasses the cumulative body of knowledge, practices, and beliefs that indigenous and local communities have developed over generations. It is often rooted in a deep understanding of local ecosystems, passed down through oral traditions, rituals, and community practices. This knowledge system emphasizes the interconnectedness of all life forms and fosters a sense of stewardship for the environment. Scholars such as Berkes (1999) and Davis and Ruddle (2010) have highlighted the importance of traditional ecological knowledge in contemporary environmental management, illustrating its potential to address ecological degradation through sustainable practices.

#### William Blake

William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work is characterized by its visionary and often mystical qualities. Blake’s artistic philosophy critiques the materialism of the Industrial Revolution, advocating for a return to a more spiritual and nature-centric worldview. His poetry and visual arts reflect profound themes of creation, transformation, and the relationship between humanity and the divine. Scholars like Northrop Frye (1957) and David Erdman (1997) have explored Blake’s cultural critique, emphasizing his role as a prophetic voice in the face of societal changes.
