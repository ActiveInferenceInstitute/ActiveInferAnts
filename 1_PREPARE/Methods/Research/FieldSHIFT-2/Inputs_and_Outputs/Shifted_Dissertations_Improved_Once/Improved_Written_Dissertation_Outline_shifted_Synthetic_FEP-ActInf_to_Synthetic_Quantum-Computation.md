## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that living systems strive to minimize surprise in their interactions with the environment, thereby maintaining their integrity and homeostasis. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes, as it suggests that perception and action are fundamentally geared toward reducing uncertainty. In contrast, quantum computation exploits the peculiar properties of quantum mechanics—such as superposition and entanglement—to process information in ways that classical systems cannot. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, exploring how principles of adaptive behavior can inform quantum information processing.

The integration of FEP and quantum computation presents a unique opportunity to rethink not only how we understand cognition and computation but also how we can develop more efficient quantum algorithms. By examining the parallels between biological systems that adaptively minimize free energy and quantum systems that leverage quantum states for optimal information processing, this research aims to unveil a new paradigm in both cognitive science and quantum mechanics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its unique perspective on quantum computation, viewing qubits and quantum algorithms through the lens of biological principles. By integrating the FEP into quantum mechanics, this dissertation proposes innovative theoretical insights and practical applications that could transform algorithm development and machine learning. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances our understanding of quantum systems but also offers new methodologies for tackling computational challenges in a variety of fields, including artificial intelligence and complex system modeling.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### The Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in statistical thermodynamics and has been extensively applied in cognitive science and biology. Friston's work on predictive coding posits that the brain functions as a Bayesian inference machine, continuously updating its beliefs about the world to minimize prediction errors. This theoretical framework has been influential in explaining various cognitive phenomena, including perception, action, and learning.

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged from the intersection of computer science and quantum mechanics in the late 20th century. Pioneering work by physicists like Richard Feynman and David Deutsch laid the groundwork for understanding how quantum bits (qubits) could be manipulated to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. The development of quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring and Grover's algorithm for search problems, has demonstrated quantum computation's potential to revolutionize various fields, including cryptography and optimization.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Recent Advancements in FEP

Recent advancements in the FEP have expanded its applications beyond neuroscience to fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and social sciences. Researchers have begun to explore how the principles of active inference can inform the design of intelligent systems that adaptively interact with their environments. This shift has opened avenues for empirical testing of FEP-based models in various domains, including machine learning and autonomous agents.

The field of quantum computation has witnessed rapid advancements, with the development of new quantum algorithms that leverage the unique properties of quantum mechanics. Techniques such as quantum annealing and variational quantum algorithms have emerged, demonstrating significant advantages over classical methods in specific problem domains. However, challenges remain in optimizing these algorithms for practical applications, particularly in the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the progress made in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research connecting cognitive science and quantum mechanics. The integration of FEP with quantum computation presents a unique opportunity to explore theoretical and practical contributions that can enhance our understanding of information processing in both biological and quantum systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in FEP

Key theories underpinning the Free Energy Principle include predictive coding and active inference. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about incoming sensory information and updates its beliefs based on prediction errors. Active inference extends this framework by suggesting that organisms actively sample their environments to minimize free energy, thereby optimizing their internal models. These theories provide a robust foundation for understanding how adaptive behavior emerges in complex systems.

#### Quantum Mechanics Principles

Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics relevant to computation include superposition, entanglement, and measurement. Superposition allows quantum systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement creates correlations between quantum particles that can be exploited for information processing. Measurement, a critical aspect of quantum mechanics, introduces challenges related to the collapse of quantum states and the role of observers in the quantum realm.
