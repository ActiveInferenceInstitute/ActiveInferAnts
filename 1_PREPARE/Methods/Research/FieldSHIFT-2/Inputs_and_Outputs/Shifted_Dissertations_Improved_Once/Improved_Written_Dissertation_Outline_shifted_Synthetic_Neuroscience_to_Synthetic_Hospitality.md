## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks in Cognitive Science and Machine Learning

Neural networks have long been a subject of interest in cognitive science, where they are used to model brain functions and processes. Early research into neural networks focused on Hebbian learning, which posits that synaptic strength increases when the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons are activated simultaneously. This principle underlies many learning and adaptation processes in both biological and artificial systems. In machine learning, neural networks have evolved to become powerful tools for pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, with applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. Recent advancements, such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks, have further expanded their capabilities, allowing for more complex and nuanced analyses.

#### Evolution of Guest Experience Theories in Hospitality Management

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly within hospitality management. Early theories focused on service quality and customer satisfaction, often framed within the context of the service encounter. More recent approaches emphasize the importance of personalization, emotional engagement, and the role of technology in shaping guest experiences. The integration of digital tools and data analytics has transformed how hospitality businesses understand and respond to guest preferences, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the guest experience. This evolution raises critical questions about how these theoretical frameworks can be integrated with emerging technologies, such as neural networks, to further enhance service delivery.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Advancements in Neural Network Applications

Recent advancements in neural network applications have demonstrated their versatility across various industries. In healthcare, for instance, neural networks are used for diagnostic purposes and predictive analytics. In finance, they underpin algorithmic trading and risk assessment. These applications illustrate the potential of neural networks to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns that inform decision-making. Furthermore, the emergence of explainable AI (XAI) frameworks has facilitated a deeper understanding of how these systems operate, allowing for greater transparency and trust in their applications.

#### Trends in Guest Experience Management

Current trends in guest experience management highlight the increasing importance of personalization and technology integration. The rise of data analytics has enabled hospitality businesses to gather and analyze guest data, leading to tailored service offerings that enhance satisfaction. Innovations such as chatbots, mobile apps, and smart room technology are reshaping the guest experience, allowing for greater customization and responsiveness. These trends underscore the necessity for hospitality providers to adopt a proactive stance in leveraging data to anticipate guest needs and preferences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research merging neuroscience with hospitality. The potential for applying neural network principles to enhance guest experience management has yet to be fully explored. This research aims to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for enhancing service delivery through data-driven approaches, ultimately contributing to a more sophisticated understanding of guest interactions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Neural Network Theories

The foundational theories of neural networks, including Hebbian learning and reinforcement learning, provide a basis for understanding how interconnected systems adapt and learn from experiences. Hebbian learning emphasizes the importance of associations between stimuli, while reinforcement learning focuses on the outcomes of actions, reinforcing behaviors that lead to positive results. These theories can be applied to model guest interactions and service adaptations in hospitality, suggesting that hospitality businesses can learn from past interactions to improve future service delivery.

#### Service Quality and Experience Theories in Hospitality

Theories of service quality, such as the SERVQUAL model, highlight the dimensions of service that influence guest satisfaction, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions can be mapped onto neural network principles, where each dimension represents a different aspect of the service experience that contributes to overall guest satisfaction. This mapping offers a framework for understanding how neural networks can facilitate the optimization of service quality.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of the "Guest Experience Neural Model"

The "Guest Experience Neural Model" emerges as a synthesis of neural network concepts and guest experience theories. This model posits that guest interactions can be viewed as a network of interconnected nodes (staff and touchpoints) that process and respond to guest data (neurotransmitters). By understanding these interactions, hospitality businesses can enhance service delivery and guest satisfaction. This model not only provides a conceptual framework but also serves as a basis for empirical testing and validation.

#### Neural Plasticity and Service Adaptation Strategies

Neural plasticity, the ability of neural networks to adapt and reorganize in response to experiences, offers valuable insights into how hospitality businesses can adapt their services based on guest feedback and changing preferences. This concept underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in service delivery, enabling businesses to remain responsive to guest needs. By fostering an organizational culture that embraces plasticity, hospitality providers can create a more resilient service environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual representation of the integrated model illustrates the interaction between staff (neurons), touchpoints (synapses), and guest data (neurotransmitters). This model serves as a framework for understanding how neural network principles can inform guest experience management, highlighting the interconnectedness of various service elements and the role of data in shaping guest interactions.
