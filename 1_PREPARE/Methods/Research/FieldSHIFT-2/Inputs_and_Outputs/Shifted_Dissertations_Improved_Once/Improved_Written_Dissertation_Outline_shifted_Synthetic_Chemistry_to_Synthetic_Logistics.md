## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of chemistry and logistics presents a unique opportunity to leverage established chemical principles to address contemporary challenges in logistics. Both fields involve transformation processes—chemical reactions in chemistry and supply chain flows in logistics. Chemistry, as a branch of science, studies the composition, structure, properties, and changes of matter, while logistics focuses on the efficient movement and storage of goods. Recognizing the parallels between these domains, this dissertation posits that the application of chemical principles can yield novel insights into logistical efficiency and sustainability.

The exploration of this intersection raises intriguing questions: How can the principles governing molecular interactions inform the dynamics of supply chain relationships? What insights can be drawn from reaction kinetics to enhance the speed and reliability of logistics operations? By delving into these questions, we can uncover a wealth of knowledge that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective on logistics by applying theoretical constructs from chemistry. Existing logistics research often employs linear, deterministic models that fail to capture the complexity and dynamism of modern supply chains. By providing a rigorous framework for optimization that is informed by chemical dynamics, this study aims to fill existing gaps in logistics research, paving the way for innovative practices in supply chain management.

The interdisciplinary nature of this research not only enhances the theoretical landscape of logistics but also offers practical solutions to pressing industry challenges. By bridging chemistry and logistics, we can foster a more holistic understanding of both fields, ultimately leading to enhanced operational efficiencies and sustainable practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Chemistry
The evolution of chemistry from alchemy to modern science marked a significant transformation in our understanding of matter. The establishment of atomic theory in the 19th century provided a foundation for understanding chemical reactions, emphasizing the importance of reaction mechanisms and the interactions between atoms and molecules. This historical context sets the stage for applying these concepts to logistics, where the flow of goods can be seen as analogous to the movement and transformation of chemical substances.

#### Logistics
Logistics has evolved from its military origins, where the focus was on the efficient supply of troops, to a complex global network that encompasses various industries. The advent of technology has revolutionized logistics, introducing concepts such as just-in-time inventory, automated warehousing, and real-time tracking. Understanding this historical context is crucial for recognizing the potential of integrating chemical principles into modern logistics practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Chemistry
Current trends in chemistry emphasize green chemistry and sustainable practices, focusing on minimizing environmental impact while maximizing efficiency. Technological integration, such as the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, is also reshaping the field. These advancements offer valuable insights into optimizing logistics processes, particularly in areas such as waste reduction and resource allocation.

#### Logistics
The logistics sector faces numerous challenges, including last-mile delivery inefficiencies, lack of visibility across supply chains, and increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices. Current research in logistics often emphasizes optimization techniques, but there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary approaches that draw from other scientific fields. By addressing this gap, we can create more resilient and adaptable logistics systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines chemical principles with logistics. This gap presents an opportunity for developing new models and frameworks that enhance operational efficiency. By bridging these two fields, this dissertation aims to contribute to a more holistic understanding of logistics optimization.
