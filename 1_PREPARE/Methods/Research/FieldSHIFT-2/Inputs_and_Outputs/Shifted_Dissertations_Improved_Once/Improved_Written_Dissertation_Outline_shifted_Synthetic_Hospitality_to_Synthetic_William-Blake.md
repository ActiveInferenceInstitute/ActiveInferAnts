## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the convergence of guest experience in hospitality and the rich, multifaceted world of William Blake. Guest experience emphasizes holistic interactions, personalization, and quality service, while Blake's work embodies profound themes of human experience, imagination, and societal critique. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, revealing how principles from hospitality can enhance the understanding and appreciation of Blake's art and poetry.

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the past few decades, moving from a focus on mere service delivery to a more comprehensive approach that encompasses emotional engagement, personalization, and the creation of memorable experiences. This paradigm shift aligns closely with Blake's artistic philosophy, which advocates for a deep emotional connection between the viewer and the artwork. By examining Blake's life and work through the lens of guest experience, this dissertation aims to illuminate the ways in which his art can be experienced more profoundly and meaningfully.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research offers a novel perspective by applying hospitality principles to literary analysis, creating a framework for audience engagement that is both experiential and interpretative. The significance lies in its potential to revolutionize how we approach art and literature, making them more accessible and engaging for contemporary audiences. By transposing guest experience principles onto Blake's work, the dissertation will provide fresh insights into his themes and techniques, fostering a deeper appreciation of his contributions to both art and society.

The integration of guest experience principles into the analysis of Blake's work not only enriches our understanding of his artistic intentions but also offers practical implications for cultural institutions seeking to enhance visitor engagement. This research could lead to innovative programming, exhibitions, and educational initiatives that resonate with diverse audiences, thereby revitalizing interest in Blake's work in contemporary contexts.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience principles in hospitality can be traced back to the early 20th century when the focus was primarily on service efficiency and customer satisfaction. Over time, scholars and practitioners began to recognize the importance of emotional engagement and the creation of memorable experiences. Key developments in this field include the introduction of service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL model, which emphasizes the dimensions of tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy (Parasuraman, Zeithaml, & Berry, 1985).

In recent years, advancements in technology have further transformed guest experiences, allowing for personalized services and real-time feedback mechanisms. The integration of digital tools, such as mobile applications and social media, has enabled hospitality providers to tailor experiences to individual preferences, thereby enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty.

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake, an influential figure in the Romantic movement, was born in London in 1757 and lived during a time of significant social and political upheaval. His life was marked by a deep engagement with the themes of imagination, spirituality, and social justice. Blake's artistic output includes a diverse range of works, including illuminated poetry, paintings, and prophetic texts, all of which reflect his unique vision of the world.

Blake's artistic techniques, such as his innovative use of color and symbolism, serve to engage the viewer's imagination and evoke emotional responses. His thematic concerns often revolve around the tension between innocence and experience, the nature of the divine, and the critique of societal norms. Understanding Blake's historical context is crucial for interpreting his work, as it provides insights into the motivations behind his artistic choices and the messages he sought to convey.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Guest Experience

Contemporary research in hospitality has placed increasing emphasis on the importance of personalization, technology integration, and service quality. Scholars have explored various aspects of guest experience, including the role of emotional engagement, the impact of storytelling on guest satisfaction, and the use of technology to enhance service delivery (Tynan & McKechnie, 2009). These studies highlight the need for hospitality providers to adopt a holistic approach that considers the emotional and experiential dimensions of guest interactions.

#### Blake Studies

Current scholarship on William Blake encompasses a wide range of interpretations, focusing on his themes, artistic innovations, and historical significance. Recent analyses have examined the intersections of Blake's work with contemporary issues, such as environmentalism, social justice, and the role of imagination in shaping human experience. Scholars have also explored the impact of Blake's unique artistic techniques on audience engagement, emphasizing the importance of experiential approaches to understanding his work (Eagleton, 2015).

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich scholarship in both hospitality and Blake studies, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that combine these fields. The potential for new methodologies and frameworks that can enrich both domains is significant. By integrating guest experience principles with literary analysis, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and provide a fresh perspective on audience engagement with Blake's work.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Models

Service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL model, provide a foundational understanding of the dimensions that contribute to guest satisfaction. These models emphasize the importance of reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles in shaping guest experiences. By applying these principles to the analysis of audience engagement with Blake's work, this dissertation seeks to develop a framework that evaluates the quality of interactions between the viewer and the artwork.

#### Romantic Ideals in Literature

The Romantic movement, of which Blake was a key figure, is characterized by an emphasis on individual experience, emotion, and the sublime. Romantic ideals advocate for a deep connection between the artist and the audience, emphasizing the role of imagination in interpreting art. Understanding these foundational theories is essential for exploring how Blake's work can be experienced through the lens of guest experience principles.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Holistic Artistic Experience

The concept of a holistic artistic experience encompasses an integrated model that considers both visual and literary art. This framework recognizes the interconnectedness of different art forms and the ways in which they can enhance audience engagement. By examining Blake's work through this lens, this dissertation aims to demonstrate how his art can be experienced as a cohesive whole, fostering deeper connections with the viewer.

#### Interpretive Personalization

Interpretive personalization refers to the ways in which individual experiences shape interpretations of Blake's work. This framework acknowledges that each viewer brings their unique background, emotions, and perspectives to the interpretation of art. By developing personalized interpretive frameworks, this dissertation seeks to enhance audience engagement with Blake's themes, allowing for a more meaningful connection between the viewer and the artwork.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes guest experience principles with Blake's artistic philosophy, focusing on engagement quality and audience interaction. This model will serve as the foundation for the empirical research conducted in this dissertation, guiding the development of metrics to assess audience engagement and inform the creation of personalized interpretive frameworks.
