## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical evolution of Quantum Computation can be traced back to the early 1980s, with seminal contributions from physicists such as Richard Feynman and David Deutsch. Their work laid the groundwork for understanding how quantum mechanics could be harnessed for computation, leading to the development of quantum algorithms capable of solving complex problems more efficiently than classical counterparts. Key milestones include Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Grover's algorithm for database search, which demonstrated the potential of quantum computation to revolutionize various fields, including cryptography and optimization.

Conversely, Buckminster Fuller’s principles emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the ecological crises and resource depletion of the time. His concepts of synergetics, tensegrity, and ephemeralization emphasized the importance of holistic design approaches that prioritize sustainability and efficiency. Fuller's work has inspired generations of architects and designers to rethink traditional practices and adopt innovative strategies that align with ecological principles.
