## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of Fuller’s concepts with logistics represents a groundbreaking shift in how we perceive and manage supply chains. Fuller’s holistic thinking, ephemeralization, and principles of tensegrity provide a framework for reimagining logistics as an interconnected system that prioritizes sustainability and efficiency. Traditionally, logistics has been viewed through a narrow lens focused on cost minimization and efficiency metrics. However, by integrating Fuller's principles, logistics can evolve into a discipline that not only optimizes resource allocation but also fosters ecological balance and social responsibility.

In this context, we pose the following questions: How can the principles of holistic design inform logistics practices? What role does technology play in facilitating this integration? How can we measure the success of these innovative approaches? 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its application of Fuller's principles to logistics, a field traditionally focused on efficiency and cost-effectiveness without a comprehensive sustainability perspective. By integrating these concepts, the dissertation seeks to establish new methodologies and frameworks that can enhance logistical practices while addressing environmental concerns. The implications of this research are significant, as they could lead to transformative changes in how logistics is taught, practiced, and regulated.

The novelty of this research lies not only in the theoretical application of Fuller's principles but also in the practical implications for industry stakeholders. By developing a framework for sustainable logistics practices, this dissertation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, providing actionable insights for organizations seeking to adopt more sustainable practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Buckminster Fuller’s Contributions to Design and Systems Thinking

Buckminster Fuller was a pioneering thinker whose contributions to design and systems thinking have had a lasting impact on various fields. His concepts of "Spaceship Earth" and "ephemeralization" emphasize the importance of viewing the planet as a single, interconnected system. Fuller’s work encourages a holistic approach to design and resource management, advocating for solutions that maximize efficiency while minimizing waste. His emphasis on sustainability and human-centered design principles resonates deeply with contemporary environmental challenges.

Fuller's notion of ephemeralization—doing "more with less"—is particularly relevant in the context of logistics, where resource optimization is paramount. By examining Fuller's contributions, we can derive valuable insights into how logistics can be reimagined to better align with ecological principles.
