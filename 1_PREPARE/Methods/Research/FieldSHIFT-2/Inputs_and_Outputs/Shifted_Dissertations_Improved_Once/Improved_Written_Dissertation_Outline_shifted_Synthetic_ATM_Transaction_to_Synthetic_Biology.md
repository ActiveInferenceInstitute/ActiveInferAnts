## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of ATM transaction concepts and ecosystem dynamics represents a novel interdisciplinary approach. ATM systems, characterized by structured transaction flows, security protocols, and user experience optimization, contrast with ecosystems, defined by complex interactions among organisms and their environments. This dissertation investigates how principles from the banking sector can inform our understanding of ecological processes.

ATM (Automated Teller Machine) technology has evolved significantly since its inception in the late 1960s, transitioning from simple cash-dispensing machines to sophisticated systems that facilitate a wide range of financial transactions. These systems are designed to maximize efficiency, security, and user satisfaction. Conversely, ecosystems, which have been studied for centuries, exhibit intricate relationships among biotic and abiotic components, governed by principles of energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species interactions. The proposed research delves into the potential synergies between these two fields, aiming to extract insights that can enhance both ecological understanding and technological applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

By applying transaction-based models to ecological dynamics, this work introduces innovative methodologies for studying energy flows, biodiversity, and resilience, making it a pioneering contribution to both fields. The interdisciplinary approach not only enhances theoretical frameworks but also provides practical applications that can address pressing ecological challenges.

The novelty of this research is underscored by its interdisciplinary nature, encouraging collaboration across fields that have historically operated in silos. By integrating concepts from banking and ecology, this dissertation aims to create a new lexicon for understanding ecosystem dynamics, thereby fostering a more holistic approach to environmental management.
