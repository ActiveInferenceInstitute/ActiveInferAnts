# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of negotiation and ATM transactions represents an opportunity to rethink user interactions in banking. Negotiation, characterized by dialogue and compromise, can inform how ATMs engage with users, moving beyond mere transactional efficiency to a more personalized and empathetic approach. In traditional banking, the ATM serves as a mere conduit for transactions, often resulting in user frustration due to rigid interfaces and impersonal interactions. By infusing negotiation principles into this domain, we can cultivate an environment where users feel more engaged and valued. 

This Shifted Domain prompts us to ask: **How can we redefine user agency in financial transactions?** The answer lies in creating a negotiation framework that empowers users, encouraging active participation and fostering a sense of ownership over their banking experiences.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking in its approach to reimagine ATMs as interactive partners in financial transactions. By applying negotiation principles, we can address existing challenges in user experience, security, and adaptability, ultimately leading to a more satisfying and engaging banking experience. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between negotiation theory and technological applications in the financial sector. This integration not only enhances the ATM's functionality but also establishes it as a facilitator of meaningful user interactions.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Negotiation

Negotiation has evolved from simple bargaining tactics to a complex interplay of psychology, communication, and strategy. Key theorists such as Fisher and Ury (1981) established frameworks that emphasize the importance of empathy, active listening, and adaptability in negotiations. Their work on principled negotiation highlights the significance of focusing on interests rather than positions, allowing for more collaborative outcomes. This theoretical foundation provides a robust framework for rethinking user interactions in ATMs, suggesting that users can be treated as partners in the transaction process rather than mere customers.

### ATM Transactions

ATMs have historically focused on efficiency and security, with limited attention given to user experience. The early design of ATMs prioritized speed and reliability, leading to interfaces that often lacked user-friendliness. Recent advancements in technology have prompted discussions on improving usability and accessibility, but the integration of personalized approaches remains underexplored. As financial technology continues to evolve, there is a growing recognition of the need for ATMs to adapt to user preferences and behaviors, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While negotiation strategies have been extensively studied in contexts such as conflict resolution and business dealings, their application in technology-mediated interactions, particularly ATMs, is largely uncharted. Conversely, ATM research has focused on operational efficiency and security, often neglecting the potential for user-centered design. This disconnect presents a unique opportunity to apply negotiation principles to enhance the user experience in ATM transactions, paving the way for a more engaging and interactive banking environment.

### Testable Hypothesis 1: 
**H1**: The integration of negotiation principles into ATM interactions will significantly improve user satisfaction scores compared to traditional ATM interfaces.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This Shifted Domain highlights critical gaps, such as the need for user feedback mechanisms in ATM design and the potential for negotiation strategies to enhance user trust and satisfaction. Current ATM interfaces often lack the flexibility to accommodate user preferences, leading to a one-size-fits-all approach that can alienate users. The integration of negotiation principles offers a pathway to create more dynamic and responsive ATM experiences, ultimately fostering a sense of partnership between users and financial institutions.

### Salient Question: 
**What role does user feedback play in shaping the negotiation interface of ATMs?**

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Principled Negotiation**: This theory emphasizes mutual interests and collaborative problem-solving. It provides a framework for understanding how ATMs can engage users in dialogue, allowing for more personalized interactions that cater to individual needs.

2. **User Experience Design**: This discipline focuses on creating intuitive interfaces that prioritize user needs. By applying user experience design principles, ATMs can be transformed into platforms that facilitate effective communication and engagement.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Negotiation-Enhanced User Interface**: This framework proposes designing ATM interfaces that facilitate user engagement through negotiation principles. By incorporating elements such as active listening and adaptability, ATMs can create more meaningful interactions with users.

2. **Adaptive Transaction Protocols**: This construct allows ATMs to adjust interactions based on user preferences and behaviors. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, ATMs can tailor their responses to individual users, leading to a more personalized experience.
