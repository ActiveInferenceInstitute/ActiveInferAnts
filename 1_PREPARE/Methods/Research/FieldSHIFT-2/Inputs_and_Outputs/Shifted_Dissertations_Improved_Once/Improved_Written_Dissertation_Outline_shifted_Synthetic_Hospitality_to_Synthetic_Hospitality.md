## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Domain A: Overview of Guest Experience Principles

Guest experience principles have evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially, the focus was on service quality, defined by tangible aspects such as cleanliness and responsiveness. However, as consumer behavior studies advanced, the understanding of guest experience expanded to include emotional and psychological dimensions. The Experience Economy Theory posits that consumers seek memorable experiences rather than mere transactions, leading to a shift in how hospitality brands engage their customers.

Moreover, the rise of social media has amplified the importance of guest experience, as guests now share their experiences widely, influencing potential customersâ€™ perceptions. This shift necessitates a more nuanced understanding of guest experience that encompasses not only the service provided but also the emotions and connections formed during the guest journey.

#### Domain B: Examination of Traditional Hospitality Management Practices

Traditional hospitality management practices have predominantly emphasized operational efficiency. This focus often resulted in standardized service protocols aimed at minimizing costs. While such practices can enhance profitability, they often neglect the nuanced needs of individual guests. The literature highlights a growing recognition of the limitations of these approaches, particularly in light of increasing competition and the demand for personalized service.

The advent of technology and data analytics presents an opportunity for hospitality organizations to move beyond traditional practices and embrace a guest-centric model. This model prioritizes understanding guest preferences and behaviors, allowing for tailored experiences that resonate with individual guests.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An analysis of existing research reveals a substantial body of literature on both guest experience and hospitality management. However, there remains a disconnect between these two fields. Guest experience literature emphasizes the importance of emotional engagement and personalization, while hospitality management literature often prioritizes operational metrics. This gap presents an opportunity for research that integrates these insights, fostering a more holistic understanding of how guest experience can inform hospitality management practices.

Furthermore, the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, into guest experience strategies remains underexplored, highlighting the need for innovative research that examines these intersections.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of guest experience principles into hospitality management is underexplored in the existing literature. Key gaps include a lack of empirical studies demonstrating the impact of guest experience on operational outcomes and insufficient frameworks for implementing guest-centric strategies in hospitality settings. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a comprehensive model that combines theoretical insights with practical applications.

It emphasizes the importance of meeting or exceeding guest expectations, which is foundational for understanding guest experience in hospitality. This theory provides a basis for assessing service delivery and its impact on guest perceptions.

#### Experience Economy Theory

Experience Economy Theory highlights the transition from a goods-based economy to one where experiences are the primary value proposition. This theory underpins the need for hospitality organizations to create memorable experiences that resonate with guests on an emotional level. The implications of this theory suggest that organizations should focus on crafting experiences that foster emotional connections with guests.

#### Employee Engagement Theory

Employee Engagement Theory asserts that engaged employees are more likely to deliver exceptional service. This theory is vital for understanding the role of employee satisfaction in enhancing guest experience. Engaged employees contribute to a positive organizational culture that translates into superior service delivery.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Holistic Guest Experience Management (HEM)

HEM is a comprehensive approach that integrates various aspects of guest experience, including emotional, functional, and social dimensions. It emphasizes the importance of viewing the guest journey as a cohesive whole rather than as isolated touchpoints. This construct enables hospitality organizations to design experiences that resonate deeply with guests throughout their journey.

#### Data-Driven Personalization (DDP)

DDP refers to the use of data analytics to tailor services and experiences to individual guest preferences. This construct is increasingly relevant in a digital age where data-driven insights can significantly enhance guest satisfaction. By leveraging data, organizations can anticipate guest needs and deliver personalized experiences that foster loyalty.

#### Sustainable Hospitality Practices (SHP)

SHP encompasses strategies that prioritize environmental sustainability and social responsibility within hospitality operations. This construct is essential for addressing the growing consumer demand for sustainable practices in the industry. By integrating sustainability into their core values, organizations can enhance their brand image and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interrelationships between HEM, DDP, SHP, and employee engagement. This model demonstrates how these constructs collectively enhance guest experience, operational efficiency, and employee satisfaction, thereby creating a virtuous cycle that benefits both guests and hospitality organizations.
