## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

The evolution of neuroscience has been marked by significant milestones, from early anatomical studies by pioneers such as Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who laid the groundwork for understanding neural connectivity, to the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These advancements have facilitated a deeper understanding of neural circuits and their role in cognitive functions. In recent years, computational neuroscience has emerged as a vital subfield, employing mathematical models and simulations to elucidate the dynamics of neural systems.

#### RxInfer.jl

Probabilistic programming has gained prominence in artificial intelligence and machine learning, with frameworks such as RxInfer.jl providing a platform for modeling complex probabilistic relationships. RxInfer.jl leverages the power of Bayesian inference and graphical models to facilitate the representation of uncertainty in data. The development of this framework has opened new avenues for researchers to tackle intricate problems across various domains, including finance, healthcare, and robotics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent research in neuroscience has highlighted the importance of neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences. This phenomenon has significant implications for learning and memory, suggesting that adaptive algorithms inspired by these principles could enhance computational models. Concurrently, advancements in probabilistic programming have focused on improving inference algorithms, with a growing emphasis on incorporating adaptive mechanisms to better handle uncertainty in real-world data.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps remain. In probabilistic programming, there is a lack of adaptive algorithms that can dynamically respond to changing data distributions. Conversely, computational models in neuroscience have not fully leveraged the potential of probabilistic frameworks. This research seeks to address these gaps by fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, leading to innovative solutions that enhance our understanding of both cognitive processes and probabilistic modeling.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theories in neuroscience, such as Hebbian learning and neural coding, provide a foundation for understanding how the brain processes information. Hebbian learning, encapsulated in the phrase "cells that fire together, wire together," emphasizes the role of synaptic strength in learning. Neural coding theories describe how information is represented in the brain, often through patterns of neural firing. Additionally, the role of neurotransmitters in modulating synaptic activity is crucial for understanding adaptive behavior.

#### Probabilistic Programming Theories

Probabilistic programming is grounded in Bayesian inference, which allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge into the modeling process. Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, serve as powerful tools for representing complex relationships among variables. Message-passing algorithms facilitate efficient inference in these models, enabling the computation of posterior distributions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of neuroscience principles into probabilistic programming gives rise to novel theoretical constructs, such as "Neural Graphs" and "Plasticity Algorithms." Neural Graphs represent the dynamic interplay between neural circuits and probabilistic models, while Plasticity Algorithms embody adaptive mechanisms that mimic synaptic changes in response to learning.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
