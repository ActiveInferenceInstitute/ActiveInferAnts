# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

An exploration of the development of the Spatial Web and Blockchain reveals key milestones, technological advancements, and the evolution of user interactions within each domain. The Spatial Web has its roots in early geographic information systems (GIS) and has evolved through technological innovations such as GPS, AR, and VR. These advancements have enabled the overlay of digital content onto the physical world, facilitating new forms of interaction.

Conversely, Blockchain technology emerged from the need for secure digital transactions, with Bitcoin being the first successful application of this technology in 2009. Since then, Blockchain has evolved to encompass a wide range of applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and supply chain management. The convergence of these two domains marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital interaction.

In parallel, Blockchain technology has gained traction as a secure and transparent means of conducting transactions. The rise of smart contracts has enabled automated agreements that execute based on predefined conditions, further enhancing trust and efficiency in digital interactions. However, while both fields have been extensively studied individually, there remains a gap in understanding how they can be integrated.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both the Spatial Web and Blockchain, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges these two domains. Existing literature primarily focuses on their individual capabilities, leaving unexplored opportunities for innovation at their intersection. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of how the integration of these technologies can lead to new applications and enhanced user experiences.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical underpinnings of this dissertation draw from relevant theories in both the Spatial Web and Blockchain domains. From the Spatial Web, Interaction Theory and Immersive Experience Theory offer insights into how users engage with digital content in physical spaces. Interaction Theory posits that user experience is shaped by the nature of the interaction, while Immersive Experience Theory emphasizes the importance of presence and engagement in immersive environments.

In the context of Blockchain, Distributed Ledger Theory and Trust Theory provide a framework for understanding the implications of decentralization and transparency in digital transactions. Distributed Ledger Theory posits that data is stored across a network of nodes, enhancing security and resilience. Trust Theory, on the other hand, explores how trust is established and maintained in digital interactions, particularly in the absence of centralized authorities.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of the Spatial Web and Blockchain gives rise to new theoretical constructs, such as **Spatial Blockchain Theory** and **Location-Based Smart Contracts**. Spatial Blockchain Theory posits that the spatial context of data can enhance the functionality and applicability of Blockchain technologies. This theory suggests that incorporating spatial attributes into Blockchain systems can lead to more robust applications, particularly in location-based services.

Location-Based Smart Contracts represent another innovative construct emerging from this integration. These smart contracts are designed to execute transactions based on the spatial context of users, enabling automated agreements that are informed by real-time location data. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize industries such as real estate and urban planning.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a cohesive model that encapsulates the interactions between spatial technologies and Blockchain, providing a framework for further research and application.
