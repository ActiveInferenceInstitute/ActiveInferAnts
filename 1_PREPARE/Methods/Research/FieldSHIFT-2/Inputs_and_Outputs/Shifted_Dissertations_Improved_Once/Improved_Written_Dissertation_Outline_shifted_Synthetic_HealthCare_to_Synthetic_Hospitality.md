## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of health care and guest experience represents a significant shift in how services are delivered, emphasizing personalization, quality, and sustainability. Historically, both sectors have operated in silos, each focusing on their distinct objectives—health care on patient outcomes and hospitality on guest satisfaction. However, as consumer expectations evolve, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more integrated approach that prioritizes the holistic experience of individuals. 

This dissertation examines the core principles of both fields to identify synergies that can enhance overall service delivery. By understanding and applying health care's patient-centered methodologies within hospitality, this research seeks to create a more cohesive and satisfying experience for guests. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it introduces a novel perspective on guest experience by applying health care principles. While both sectors share a common goal of enhancing individual well-being, the methodologies and frameworks employed have often been disparate. This dissertation highlights the importance of holistic service delivery that prioritizes guest involvement and satisfaction, thereby filling a critical gap in existing literature. 

By exploring the intersection of health care and hospitality, this research not only contributes to theoretical advancements but also offers practical implications for industry stakeholders seeking to innovate and improve service quality. Additionally, the study aims to propose new frameworks that can be tested and refined through future research.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of patient-centered care be adapted to enhance guest experiences?
2. What models can be developed to measure and improve experience quality in hospitality?
3. How can sustainability practices from health care be effectively integrated into the hospitality sector?
4. What innovative technologies can facilitate the integration of health care principles into hospitality services?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

An overview of the evolution of health care and hospitality reveals key milestones that have shaped their current practices. Health care has transitioned from a paternalistic model, where providers dictated treatment, to a more collaborative, patient-centered approach that emphasizes shared decision-making and personalization. Similarly, the hospitality industry has evolved from a focus on basic service provision to a more nuanced understanding of guest experience, characterized by customization and emotional engagement. 

This historical context sets the stage for understanding the potential for cross-pollination between the two fields. The integration of health care principles into hospitality practices can be viewed as a natural evolution, driven by changing consumer expectations and the demand for more personalized services.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

A review of contemporary research focusing on patient-centered care in health care and guest experience in hospitality reveals a wealth of frameworks and methodologies. In health care, models such as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) emphasize the importance of patient feedback in improving care quality. In hospitality, frameworks like the SERVQUAL model assess service quality through dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, and responsiveness. 

Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that merges these concepts, highlighting an opportunity for innovative frameworks that can enhance service delivery across both domains. 

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in interdisciplinary research underscores the potential for innovative frameworks and models that merge health care and hospitality. Current literature often overlooks the shared principles of service quality and guest satisfaction, which can be enriched by integrating health care methodologies into hospitality practices. 

This dissertation aims to address these gaps by exploring the synergies between the two fields and proposing a comprehensive framework that enhances guest experiences through the application of health care principles.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient-Centered Care Theory

Patient-Centered Care Theory emphasizes the role of patient engagement in health outcomes. This theory posits that when patients are actively involved in their care, they experience better health outcomes and greater satisfaction. Key components include communication, shared decision-making, and a holistic understanding of patient needs. By applying these principles to hospitality, we can foster a more engaging and satisfying guest experience.

#### Service Quality Theory

Service Quality Theory analyzes dimensions of service delivery and guest satisfaction. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, identifies five key dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—that influence service quality perceptions. Understanding these dimensions is crucial for developing a comprehensive framework that enhances guest experiences in hospitality settings.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Guest Empowerment Theory

Guest Empowerment Theory provides a framework for understanding how guest involvement impacts satisfaction and loyalty. This theory suggests that when guests feel empowered to express their preferences and participate in their service experience, their overall satisfaction increases. This perspective aligns with the principles of patient-centered care, emphasizing the importance of active engagement in the service process.

#### Experience Quality Index (EQI)

The proposed Experience Quality Index (EQI) serves as a model for measuring guest experiences. The EQI incorporates dimensions from both patient-centered care and service quality theories, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of guest satisfaction. By evaluating factors such as emotional engagement, personalization, and service delivery, the EQI aims to provide a robust tool for hospitality professionals seeking to enhance their service offerings.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model combines elements from both domains to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing guest experiences. This model emphasizes the importance of personalization, engagement, and sustainability, advocating for a holistic approach to service delivery that prioritizes guest well-being. 

By bridging the gap between health care and hospitality, this model offers a roadmap for practitioners seeking to innovate and improve their service offerings. The model's applicability can be tested through empirical research, providing a basis for future studies.
