## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Negotiation
Negotiation theories have evolved significantly over the decades, with key frameworks including interest-based negotiation, integrative bargaining, and the dual concern model. Interest-based negotiation emphasizes the importance of understanding underlying interests rather than positions, allowing for more creative solutions. Integrative bargaining focuses on collaboration to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, while the dual concern model highlights the balance between concern for self and concern for others. These theories provide a robust foundation for understanding how parties can navigate complex interactions, which can be analogously applied to chemical reactions. Moreover, the application of game theory in negotiation provides a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions, shedding light on optimal decision-making processes that can be reflected in chemical reaction pathways.

#### Chemical Reactions
The study of chemical reactions has been guided by classical theories such as collision theory, transition state theory, and the role of catalysts. Collision theory posits that for a reaction to occur, reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy and proper orientation. Transition state theory further refines this understanding by introducing the concept of an activated complex, a transient state that occurs during the transformation from reactants to products. Catalysts, which lower the activation energy required for reactions, can be viewed as facilitators that enhance the likelihood of successful 'negotiation' between reactants. Recent advancements in reaction dynamics and catalysis have opened new avenues for understanding how reaction conditions can be optimized, paralleling negotiation strategies that aim for efficient outcomes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary research in negotiation strategies has expanded into various domains, including conflict resolution, business negotiations, and international diplomacy. Techniques such as principled negotiation and the use of mediation have gained traction, emphasizing the importance of communication, relationship-building, and mutual gains. In the realm of chemical reactions, advancements in catalysis and reaction dynamics have led to new methodologies that improve reaction efficiency and selectivity. However, the intersection of these two fields remains largely unexplored, presenting an opportunity for innovative theoretical and practical developments. The current literature lacks a comprehensive framework that integrates negotiation principles into chemical kinetics, highlighting a significant gap that this dissertation aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich literature in both negotiation and chemistry, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that combine insights from these fields. This research identifies the need for models that facilitate a deeper understanding of both negotiation dynamics and chemical interactions. By integrating principles from negotiation theory into chemical kinetics, we can develop frameworks that enhance our understanding of molecular behavior and optimize reaction conditions. Furthermore, the exploration of negotiation principles can lead to the identification of novel catalysts and reaction pathways, ultimately contributing to the advancement of both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Negotiation Theories
Key negotiation theories, including interest-based negotiation, the dual concern model, and game theory, provide a foundational understanding of how parties interact and achieve outcomes. Interest-based negotiation emphasizes collaboration and understanding, while the dual concern model highlights the importance of balancing self-interest with concern for others. Game theory offers a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions, providing insights into optimal decision-making processes. These theories can be directly transposed into the realm of chemical interactions, where reactants must negotiate their pathways to product formation.

#### Chemical Theories
Chemical theories such as collision theory, transition state theory, and the role of catalysts are essential for understanding reaction mechanisms. Collision theory explains the importance of molecular collisions in facilitating reactions, while transition state theory introduces the concept of an activated complex. Catalysts, which lower activation energy, play a crucial role in enhancing reaction rates and can be likened to negotiation facilitators that promote successful interactions. By drawing parallels between these theories and negotiation principles, we can establish a comprehensive framework that bridges the two fields.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation proposes the introduction of "Negotiation Dynamics" as a framework for understanding reactant interactions. This construct posits that reactants engage in a form of negotiation, where they must balance their individual interests to achieve a successful outcome. Additionally, the development of "Catalytic Negotiation" theory seeks to explain the role of catalysts in chemical processes as analogous to facilitators in negotiation, enhancing the likelihood of successful outcomes. This theoretical framework not only enriches our understanding of chemical reactions but also provides a novel lens through which to view negotiation strategies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes negotiation principles with chemical reaction dynamics, illustrating how reactants "negotiate" to reach product formation. This model emphasizes the importance of communication pathways, trust, and flexibility in reaction pathways, drawing parallels between successful negotiation strategies and effective chemical interactions. The model can be visualized as follows:

| **Negotiation Principle** | **Chemical Equivalent** | **Impact on Reaction** |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Interest-based negotiation | Molecular affinity       | Enhanced interaction rates |
| Dual concern model        | Reaction equilibrium     | Stabilization of intermediates |
| Game theory               | Reaction pathways        | Optimization of product yield |
