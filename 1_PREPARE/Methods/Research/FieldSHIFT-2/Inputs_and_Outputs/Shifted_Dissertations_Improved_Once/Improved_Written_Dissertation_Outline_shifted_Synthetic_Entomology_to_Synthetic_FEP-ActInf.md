## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of entomology and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability. The foundational concept of FEP, primarily articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, suggests that living organisms are driven by a fundamental imperative to minimize the discrepancies between their internal models and the external environment. Insects, with their remarkable adaptations and complex social behaviors, provide rich examples for exploring the principles of FEP. Their evolutionary history showcases a plethora of strategies that have enabled survival and reproduction in diverse ecological niches, making them ideal subjects for studying adaptive systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to illuminate the mechanisms of adaptation and decision-making in both biological and artificial systems. By applying insights from insect biology to the FEP, we can develop a more integrated understanding of how organisms navigate their environments. The implications extend beyond entomology and cognitive science; they touch on artificial intelligence and ecological sustainability, suggesting that principles derived from insect behavior can inform the design of intelligent systems and sustainable ecological practices. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances theoretical frameworks but also has practical applications in technology and environmental policy.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How do insect adaptations exemplify the principles of free energy minimization?
2. In what ways can the metamorphic processes of insects inform dynamic model updating in cognitive systems?
3. How do social behaviors in insect colonies illustrate collective active inference and decision-making?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of entomology has been marked by key discoveries that have shaped our understanding of insect biology. From the early classification systems established by Carl Linnaeus to the modern genetic and ecological studies, entomology has continuously evolved. Similarly, the Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and has been applied across various domains, including neuroscience, biology, and cognitive science. Foundational theories such as Bayesian inference and predictive coding have provided a framework for understanding how organisms process information and adapt to their environments.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research on insect adaptations has revealed a wealth of strategies that insects employ to survive and thrive in their environments. Studies have focused on camouflage, mimicry, and sensory processing, highlighting the intricate ways in which insects interact with their surroundings. Concurrently, the application of the FEP in cognitive science has led to advancements in understanding perception, action, and decision-making processes in humans and machines. However, the integration of these two fields remains nascent, with limited exploration of how insect behavior can inform cognitive models and artificial intelligence.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The identification of gaps in the integration of biological insights into cognitive models presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research. By bridging entomology and the FEP, this dissertation aims to fill these gaps and explore new avenues for understanding adaptive systems. The potential for collaboration between entomologists, cognitive scientists, and AI researchers is vast, and this research seeks to catalyze such interdisciplinary efforts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Adaptation theory in evolutionary biology posits that organisms evolve traits that enhance their survival and reproductive success. This theory is complemented by predictive coding frameworks in cognitive science, which suggest that the brain continuously updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors based on sensory input. Both theories emphasize the importance of adaptability and the ability to respond to environmental changes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The concept of insective inference emerges as a model for understanding adaptive behavior in insects. This framework posits that insects utilize a form of active inference, continuously updating their internal models based on sensory feedback to minimize free energy. Additionally, metamorphic updating serves as a framework for dynamic learning, wherein the life stages of insects represent distinct phases of model refinement and adaptation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes a comprehensive model that synthesizes insect adaptations with the principles of FEP. The model posits that insect behaviors, metamorphosis, and social structures can be understood as mechanisms for minimizing free energy, thereby providing insights into both biological and artificial systems. The following table illustrates various insect adaptations and their corresponding principles of free energy minimization:

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Camouflage                | Reducing visibility to predators                | Biomimetic design in military technology  |
