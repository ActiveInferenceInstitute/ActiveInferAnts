# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Development of Negotiation Theory

Negotiation theory has evolved significantly since its inception, with key scholars such as Fisher and Ury (1981), who introduced the interest-based approach, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying interests rather than positions. This approach laid the groundwork for collaborative negotiation strategies that prioritize mutual gain. Other influential theories include the dual concern model, which posits that negotiators balance concern for their own outcomes with concern for the outcomes of others (Pruitt & Rubin, 1986). These foundational principles have shaped contemporary practices in conflict resolution and negotiation.

### Historical Milestones in Entomology

Entomology has a rich history, marked by significant discoveries and advancements in the understanding of insect behavior and ecology. Early entomologists such as Carl Linnaeus and Charles Darwin laid the groundwork for the classification and evolutionary understanding of insects. The study of social insects, particularly ants and bees, has revealed intricate social structures and communication systems, highlighting the importance of cooperation and competition in their survival. Notable advancements in ethology, such as the work of Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen, have further illuminated the behavioral complexities of insects, providing a foundation for contemporary studies in entomology.

Despite the advancements in both negotiation theory and entomology, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the intersection of these two fields. The application of negotiation principles to insect behavior has not been thoroughly explored, presenting an opportunity for interdisciplinary research that could yield novel insights. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by examining insect interactions through the lens of negotiation, thereby fostering innovative collaborations between entomologists and negotiation theorists.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Key Negotiation Theories

The interest-based approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying interests of negotiating parties, rather than focusing solely on their stated positions. This approach can be applied to insect interactions, where the underlying interests of individuals (e.g., access to resources, mating opportunities) shape their negotiation strategies. The dual concern model, which posits that negotiators balance concern for their own outcomes with concern for the outcomes of others, can also be relevant in understanding the cooperative behaviors exhibited by social insects.

### Social Behavior Theories in Entomology

Theories such as kin selection and social learning provide valuable insights into the social structures of insect communities. Kin selection explains the evolution of altruistic behaviors among related individuals, while social learning emphasizes the role of observational learning in shaping behaviors within insect societies. These theories can be integrated with negotiation principles to develop a comprehensive understanding of insect interactions.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Integrated Theoretical Framework

This dissertation proposes a theoretical framework that integrates negotiation principles with insect behavior. Concepts such as "Insect Negotiation" and "Mutualistic Agreements" will be introduced to describe the negotiation-like behaviors exhibited by insects in their social structures. By framing insect interactions as negotiated agreements, this research aims to provide a novel perspective on the dynamics of insect communication and cooperation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, illustrating the interactions between negotiation strategies and insect behavior. This model will highlight key variables such as resource availability, environmental factors, and social structures, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these elements influence insect negotiation behaviors.
