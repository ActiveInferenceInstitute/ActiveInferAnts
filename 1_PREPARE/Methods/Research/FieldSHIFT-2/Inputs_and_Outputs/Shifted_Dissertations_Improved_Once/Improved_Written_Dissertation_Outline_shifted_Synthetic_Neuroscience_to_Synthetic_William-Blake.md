# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neural networks and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements. By leveraging advanced concepts from neuroscience, such as synaptic plasticity, neural oscillations, and cognitive resonance, this research seeks to uncover deeper insights into Blake's artistic vision and its implications for human consciousness. The potential impact of this work extends beyond literary studies, offering interdisciplinary applications in cognitive science, art education, and digital humanities, thereby fostering a richer understanding of the cognitive processes underlying creativity and artistic expression.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of neural networks and literary analysis represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding creativity and artistic expression. Neural networks, as models of cognition and learning, provide a unique lens through which to examine the complexities of Blake's thematic dualities and their resonance with human experience. Neural networks, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, involve interconnected nodes (neurons) that communicate through weighted connections (synapses). This model can be analogously applied to Blake's work, where themes and motifs can be viewed as nodes in a network, each influencing and interacting with one another.

To deepen our understanding, one might ask: How do the interconnected themes in Blake's work mirror the neural pathways in the brain? What cognitive processes are engaged when readers encounter these thematic networks? Such questions will guide our exploration of Blake's oeuvre through the lens of neural networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two traditionally distinct fieldsâ€”neuroscience and literature. By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, this dissertation not only offers fresh interpretations of his themes but also contributes to the broader discourse on the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation and appreciation. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that recontextualizes Blake's poetic and artistic endeavors through the lens of cognitive science, potentially leading to new insights into the nature of creativity itself.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Blake's themes be modeled as neural networks?
2. In what ways do the dynamics of neural communication enhance our understanding of Blake's artistic expression?
3. What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for the fields of neuroscience, literary studies, and education?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The development of neural networks in cognitive science has its roots in early explorations of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Pioneers such as McCulloch and Pitts (1943) laid the groundwork for understanding neural computation, while subsequent advancements in deep learning have enabled more complex modeling of cognitive functions. These developments have opened avenues for interdisciplinary research, inviting literary scholars to reconsider the cognitive aspects of artistic creation.

William Blake (1757-1827) emerged as a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, characterized by his unique blend of poetry, visual art, and philosophical inquiry. His life was marked by socio-political turbulence, including the American and French revolutions, which profoundly influenced his artistic philosophy. Blake's work reflects a deep engagement with themes of duality, spirituality, and the human condition, making him an ideal subject for this interdisciplinary exploration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Research in neural networks has expanded significantly, with applications ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, the intersection of neural networks and literary analysis remains underexplored. Existing studies on Blake primarily focus on thematic criticism, historical context, and aesthetic analysis. This dissertation aims to fill the gap by applying neural network principles to Blake's work, thereby enriching our understanding of his themes and their cognitive implications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing interest in interdisciplinary studies, there remains a notable lack of research that combines neuroscience and literature. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovative insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic engagement. By applying neural network concepts to Blake's themes, this research seeks to illuminate the underlying cognitive processes that shape artistic expression and audience reception.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key concepts in neural networks, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations, provide a foundational basis for understanding the dynamics of cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, which is critical for learning and memory. Neural oscillations, on the other hand, represent rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal activity that facilitate communication between different brain regions. These concepts can be applied to Blake's work, where thematic evolution and resonance can be viewed as analogous to neural adaptations and interactions.

Blake's philosophical dualities, such as innocence versus experience, body versus spirit, and the material versus the divine, serve as a rich tapestry for exploring human experience. These dualities can be conceptualized as thematic networks that communicate and influence one another, mirroring the interconnected nature of neural networks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces the concept of thematic neurons and synapses in the context of Blake's work. Thematic neurons represent central motifs or ideas within Blake's poetry and art, while synapses illustrate the connections and interactions between these themes. Additionally, the concept of cognitive resonance is proposed as a measure of emotional and intellectual engagement, capturing the dynamic interplay between reader interpretation and thematic expression.

#### Hypothesis 1: Thematic Resonance and Reader Engagement
- **Hypothesis**: Readers who engage with Blake's themes will exhibit higher levels of emotional resonance when themes are presented in interconnected networks, as opposed to isolated themes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model depicts Blake's themes as a dynamic neural network, illustrating their interconnections and influences. This model serves as a framework for analyzing the complexity of Blake's artistic vision, providing insights into how themes evolve and resonate within the context of human consciousness.

## Methodology
