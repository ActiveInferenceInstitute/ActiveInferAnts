## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of guest experience as a key driver of success. In a competitive market, the differentiation of services is paramount, and organizations are turning to innovative strategies to enhance guest satisfaction. Concurrently, the principles of chemical reactions have long been established as foundational concepts in scientific inquiry. This dissertation proposes a novel approach by integrating these two domains, thereby creating a new paradigm for understanding and enhancing guest experiences through the lens of chemical reaction principles.

The application of scientific principles, particularly those from chemistry, provides a systematic framework for analyzing and optimizing guest interactions. This interdisciplinary approach not only allows for a deeper understanding of guest behavior but also introduces a structured methodology for service delivery that can lead to enhanced guest satisfaction and loyalty.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemical Reaction Principles

Chemical reaction principles have evolved significantly since the establishment of modern chemistry in the 17th century. Fundamental concepts such as stoichiometry, reaction kinetics, and thermodynamics emerged from the works of pioneering scientists like Antoine Lavoisier and J.J. Berzelius. These principles have been instrumental in understanding how substances interact, transform, and reach equilibrium.

#### Guest Experience Theories in Hospitality Management

In parallel, the hospitality industry has seen the development of various theories surrounding guest experience. Early theories emphasized service quality and customer satisfaction, while contemporary paradigms focus on personalization, co-creation, and the holistic guest journey. Scholars such as Pine and Gilmore have posited that experiences are the new economic offering, highlighting the importance of creating memorable interactions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemical Principles

Current research in chemistry delves into advanced topics such as reaction mechanisms, catalytic processes, and the thermodynamic properties of chemical systems. The study of kinetics has also expanded, with applications in fields ranging from materials science to biochemistry, illustrating the breadth of chemical principles and their relevance across disciplines.

#### Guest Experience Paradigms

In hospitality, recent studies have focused on the integration of technology in enhancing guest experiences, the role of emotional intelligence in service delivery, and the significance of feedback loops in maintaining guest satisfaction. The rise of personalized services through data analytics has transformed how hospitality brands approach guest interactions, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both fields, a notable gap exists in interdisciplinary research that connects chemical principles with hospitality management. This dissertation aims to fill this void by exploring how scientific methodologies can be applied to enhance service delivery and guest experiences. The opportunities for innovation in this domain are vast, as the application of chemical principles can lead to more efficient processes, improved guest satisfaction, and sustainable practices within the hospitality sector.
