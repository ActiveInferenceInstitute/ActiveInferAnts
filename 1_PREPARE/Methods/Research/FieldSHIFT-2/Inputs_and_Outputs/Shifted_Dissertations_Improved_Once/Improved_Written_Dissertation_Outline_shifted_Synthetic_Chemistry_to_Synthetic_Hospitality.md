## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By transposing core concepts from chemistry—namely transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms—into the context of hospitality, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The significance of this research lies not only in its potential to revolutionize hospitality management practices but also in its capacity to foster personalized guest experiences and create sustainable service models. The findings promise substantial impacts on service quality, guest loyalty, and overall business success, contributing to both academic discourse and practical applications within the hospitality sector.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, recognizing that guest experience is a key driver of business success. Traditional metrics of performance, such as occupancy rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR), are increasingly being supplemented by qualitative measures of guest satisfaction and loyalty. Concurrently, the principles of chemical reactions have long been established as foundational concepts in scientific inquiry, providing a structured framework for understanding complex processes. This dissertation proposes a novel approach by integrating these two domains, thereby creating a new paradigm for understanding and enhancing guest experiences through the lens of chemical reaction principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between the sciences and hospitality management. It introduces a transformative framework that can reshape service delivery, improve guest satisfaction, and foster loyalty. The novelty lies in the application of chemical principles to a traditionally qualitative field, allowing for a more structured and analytical approach to guest experience design. By employing scientific methodologies, this research aims to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of applying chemical principles in hospitality settings.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The central research questions guiding this dissertation are:

- How can the principles of chemical reactions be applied to enhance guest experience in hospitality?
- What are the key touchpoints in the guest journey that can be optimized using these principles?
- How can the proposed framework lead to measurable improvements in guest satisfaction and operational efficiency?

The objectives of this research include:

1. To analyze the application of chemical principles in the context of guest experience.
2. To identify critical touchpoints in the guest journey that can be enhanced through scientific methodologies.
3. To develop a framework that integrates chemical principles with hospitality management practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Chemical Reaction Principles and Their Evolution in Scientific Literature

Chemical reaction principles, including transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms, have been foundational in the development of modern chemistry. The evolution of these concepts can be traced back to early philosophers and alchemists, who sought to understand the nature of matter and its transformations. With the advent of the scientific method in the 17th century, these principles were rigorously defined and explored, leading to significant advancements in both theoretical and applied chemistry.

#### Historical Development of Guest Experience Theories in Hospitality Management

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a focus on service delivery to a more holistic understanding of the guest journey. Early hospitality management theories emphasized operational efficiency and service quality. However, contemporary frameworks prioritize personalization, emotional engagement, and co-creation of experiences. Scholars such as Pine and Gilmore (1999) introduced the concept of the "experience economy," highlighting the importance of creating memorable experiences for guests.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Current Research on Chemical Kinetics, Thermodynamics, and Catalysis

Current research in chemical kinetics explores the rates of reactions and the factors influencing them, such as temperature, concentration, and catalysts. Thermodynamics examines the energy changes associated with chemical reactions, while catalysis focuses on the role of catalysts in accelerating reactions without being consumed. These principles have broad applications across various scientific fields, including materials science, pharmacology, and environmental science.

#### Review of Contemporary Guest Experience Paradigms

Contemporary research in hospitality management emphasizes the importance of personalization, service quality, and technology integration in enhancing guest experiences. Scholars have explored various frameworks, including the SERVQUAL model, which measures service quality based on dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. Additionally, the role of technology in shaping guest experiences has gained significant attention, with studies examining the impact of mobile applications, artificial intelligence, and social media on guest interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the extensive research in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary studies that connect chemical principles with hospitality management. This research presents an opportunity to apply scientific methodologies to enhance service delivery and guest experiences. By exploring the parallels between chemical reactions and guest interactions, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and contribute to the development of a new framework for understanding guest experiences.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Discussion of Key Theories in Chemistry

Key theories in chemistry, such as transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms, provide a structured understanding of how chemical reactions occur. Transformation refers to the process of changing one substance into another, while catalysis involves the acceleration of a reaction through the introduction of a catalyst. Equilibrium describes the state in which reactants and products are present in stable proportions, while kinetics focuses on the rates of reactions. Thermodynamics examines the energy changes associated with these processes, and mechanisms detail the step-by-step pathways through which reactions occur.

#### Overview of Guest Experience Theories

Guest experience theories, including holistic experience, personalization, service quality, and co-creation, provide insights into how guests perceive and interact with hospitality services. The holistic experience framework emphasizes the importance of considering all aspects of the guest journey, while personalization focuses on tailoring experiences to individual preferences. Service quality theories, such as the SERVQUAL model, assess the dimensions of service delivery, and co-creation highlights the collaborative nature of guest experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces several new constructs that emerge from the integration of chemical principles and guest experience theories. These include:

- **Guest Transformation**: The process by which guests undergo a change in perception or experience during their stay.
- **Experience Catalysts**: Elements within the guest journey that enhance or accelerate positive experiences.
- **Satisfaction Equilibrium**: A state in which guest satisfaction is balanced through continuous feedback and adjustment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between chemical principles and guest experience elements. This model will serve as a foundation for analyzing guest interactions and developing strategies for enhancing satisfaction and operational efficiency.
