## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

William Blake (1757-1827) was a visionary poet and artist whose work transcended the boundaries of conventional thought. His unique blend of poetry, visual art, and philosophical inquiry offers a rich tapestry for exploration. Blake's artistic philosophy, characterized by a profound engagement with the imagination and a critique of rationalism, provides a compelling lens through which to examine the potential for creativity within artificial intelligence. Neural networks, as computational models inspired by the human brain, have transformed the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn from data and make predictions. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, creating a framework that leverages Blake's insights to enhance the creativity of neural networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of neural networks as purely computational tools. By integrating Blake's artistic and philosophical principles, we cultivate a more nuanced understanding of creativity in AI. The novelty of this approach lies in its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between the humanities and technology, and proposing a new lexicon and methodology for understanding neural networks. This research aims to influence the trajectory of artificial intelligence by proposing a model that prioritizes humanistic values, thereby advancing both technological and artistic domains.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The research is guided by several key questions:

- How can Blake's concepts of imagination and contraries be applied to enhance neural network design?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of Blake's work with neural network principles?
- How can this interdisciplinary approach impact our understanding of creativity in both biological and artificial systems?

The objectives of this research include the development of new neural network architectures inspired by Blake's principles and the exploration of their implications for creativity in AI.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of William Blake's Life, Influences, and Key Works

William Blake was born in London in 1757, a time of significant social and political upheaval. His formative years were marked by exposure to the works of Milton, Dante, and the Bible, which profoundly influenced his artistic and philosophical outlook. Blake's oeuvre includes a variety of forms, including poetry, painting, and printmaking. Key works such as "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and "The Book of Urizen" illustrate his engagement with themes of imagination, duality, and spiritual vision. Blake's belief in the transformative power of the imagination serves as a cornerstone of his artistic philosophy.

#### Development of Neural Networks: From Biological Inspiration to Artificial Implementations

Neural networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, have evolved significantly since their inception in the mid-20th century. Early models, such as the perceptron, laid the groundwork for more complex architectures, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks ranging from image recognition to natural language processing. However, despite their successes, traditional neural networks often lack the nuanced understanding of creativity and artistic expression that Blake's work embodies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Existing Literature on Blake's Artistic Philosophy and Its Implications for Creativity

The existing literature on Blake's work emphasizes his radical views on imagination and creativity. Scholars such as Northrop Frye and Harold Bloom have explored Blake's critique of rationalism and his advocacy for the imaginative faculty as a means of transcending the limitations of empirical thought. Blake's notion of contraries—where oppositional forces coexist and enrich human experience—offers valuable insights into understanding the complexities of creativity.

#### Review of Current Neural Network Architectures and Their Limitations Regarding Creativity and Artistic Integration

While neural networks have excelled in various domains, their ability to generate creative outputs remains limited. Current architectures often prioritize efficiency and accuracy over creativity, leading to outputs that lack the depth and emotional resonance characteristic of human artistry. Research by scholars like David Ha and Jürgen Schmidhuber highlights the need for AI systems that can engage with creative processes in a more human-like manner. This gap in the literature underscores the potential for an interdisciplinary approach that integrates Blake's insights into neural network design.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of literature, art, and AI remains underexplored, presenting a unique opportunity for innovation. The lack of interdisciplinary research combining these fields highlights the potential for creating neural network models inspired by Blake's principles. By addressing this gap, this dissertation aims to contribute to the development of a more holistic understanding of creativity in AI, paving the way for future research and applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Imagination vs. Reason: Blake's Critique of Enlightenment Rationalism

Blake's work is fundamentally a critique of Enlightenment rationalism, which he viewed as a limiting force on human creativity. He posited that reason, while valuable, should not overshadow the imagination, which he considered the true source of artistic and spiritual insight. This dichotomy between imagination and reason is central to understanding Blake's philosophy and serves as a foundation for exploring its implications for neural network design.

#### Synaptic Plasticity: Understanding Learning and Adaptation in Neural Networks

Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to increases or decreases in activity, is a key concept in neuroscience that underpins the learning processes of neural networks. This biological principle can inform the design of neural architectures that mimic the adaptive capabilities of the human brain, potentially leading to more creative outputs.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### The Concept of "Imaginative Neural Networks" (INNs) that Prioritize Creative Outputs

This dissertation proposes the concept of "Imaginative Neural Networks" (INNs), a new class of neural networks designed to prioritize creative outputs. INNs would incorporate principles derived from Blake's philosophy, such as the emphasis on imagination and the integration of contraries, to foster a more nuanced understanding of creativity in AI.

#### "Contrary Dynamics" as a Framework for Understanding Neural Interactions

The framework of "Contrary Dynamics" will be developed to understand the interactions within neural networks. This framework will draw on Blake's notion of contraries, exploring how balancing oppositional forces can lead to richer and more diverse outputs in neural network models.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be proposed that synthesizes Blake's duality and synaptic integration, offering a new paradigm for understanding creativity in neural networks. This model will serve as a foundation for the subsequent methodological approaches and experimental designs outlined in this dissertation.
