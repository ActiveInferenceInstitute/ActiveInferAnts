## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a theoretical foundation for understanding adaptive behavior in biological systems, emphasizing the role of prediction and error minimization. According to the FEP, living organisms are driven by the need to minimize the difference between their predictions about the world and the actual sensory inputs they receive. This principle has profound implications for cognitive science, as it offers a framework for understanding how organisms learn from their environment and adapt their behavior accordingly.

Conversely, Guest Experience Management (GEM) focuses on optimizing interactions between guests and hospitality providers. GEM encompasses the various touchpoints in a guest's journey, from pre-arrival to post-departure, and aims to enhance the overall experience through personalized service and effective communication. This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, leveraging insights from the FEP to enhance GEM practices. By understanding guest behavior through the lens of cognitive science, hospitality providers can create more effective strategies for engagement and satisfaction.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle originated in the field of cognitive science, particularly in the works of Karl Friston and his colleagues. It posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy, which is a measure of surprise or prediction error. This principle has been used to explain a variety of phenomena, from perception and action to learning and decision-making. The FEP emphasizes the importance of predictive coding, where the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates its beliefs based on the discrepancies between predictions and actual inputs.

#### Guest Experience Management

Guest Experience Management has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a focus on service quality to a more comprehensive understanding of the guest journey. Early approaches to GEM concentrated on the tangible elements of service delivery, such as cleanliness and efficiency. However, as the hospitality industry has become increasingly competitive, there has been a shift towards a more holistic view that encompasses emotional and experiential factors. This evolution has led to the development of various frameworks and models aimed at enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature on the FEP has primarily focused on its applications in cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Researchers have explored how the FEP can inform our understanding of perception, action, and learning processes. However, there is a paucity of research that applies these principles to the realm of hospitality and guest experience.

In the field of GEM, current trends emphasize personalization, service consistency, and the use of technology to enhance guest interactions. While there is a growing body of literature on the importance of understanding guest preferences and behaviors, the integration of cognitive science principles, such as the FEP, remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive science and hospitality management presents significant gaps in the current literature. While GEM practices have evolved to include more sophisticated methods of understanding guest behavior, the application of the FEP offers a unique opportunity to deepen this understanding. There is a need for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from cognitive science with practical applications in the hospitality industry, paving the way for innovative strategies that enhance guest experiences.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Overview of Key Theories Underpinning the Free Energy Principle

The FEP is grounded in several foundational theories, including predictive coding, Bayesian inference, and the notion of active inference. Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about incoming sensory data and updates these predictions based on the discrepancies between expected and actual inputs. Bayesian inference, on the other hand, provides a mathematical framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. Active inference extends these concepts by suggesting that organisms not only update their beliefs but also take actions to reduce prediction error.

#### Discussion of Established Models in Guest Experience Management

In GEM, several established models aim to enhance guest satisfaction and loyalty. The Service Quality Model (SERVQUAL) identifies five dimensions of service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The Experience Economy framework emphasizes the importance of creating memorable experiences for guests. Additionally, the Customer Journey Mapping approach helps organizations visualize and optimize the various touchpoints in a guest's experience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Introduction of Novel Constructs

This dissertation proposes the introduction of two novel constructs: "Guest Predictive Models" and "Active Service Inference." Guest Predictive Models leverage data analytics and machine learning to anticipate guest needs and preferences based on historical interactions. Active Service Inference refers to the proactive strategies that hospitality providers can implement to align their services with guest expectations, thereby reducing prediction error and enhancing satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines elements of the FEP with GEM practices. This model emphasizes the interplay between prediction, feedback, and service delivery. By understanding how guests form expectations and how these expectations can be influenced by service providers, this model offers a framework for creating more personalized and adaptive guest experiences. The model highlights the importance of continuous feedback loops, where guest experiences inform service design, leading to improved outcomes for both guests and providers.
