# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Negotiation

Negotiation has evolved from a purely transactional process to a more relational approach, emphasizing collaboration and mutual benefit. Key historical milestones include the development of negotiation theories such as the Harvard Negotiation Project and the emergence of integrative bargaining strategies. The Harvard Negotiation Project, initiated in the 1980s, introduced the concept of interest-based negotiation, which focuses on understanding the underlying interests of all parties involved rather than merely haggling over positions. This approach promotes collaboration, fostering outcomes that are beneficial to all stakeholders.

### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience has gained prominence in the hospitality industry, evolving from basic service delivery to a holistic approach that encompasses all touchpoints in the guest journey. Key historical developments include the introduction of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and the increasing importance of personalization in service delivery. The rise of CRM systems has allowed hospitality organizations to gather and analyze guest data, leading to more tailored experiences that cater to individual preferences. This shift towards personalization has become a cornerstone of modern hospitality, as guests increasingly expect services that align with their specific needs and desires.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Negotiation

Current research in negotiation emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence, cultural sensitivity, and ethical considerations. Scholars have explored various negotiation strategies, including collaborative approaches and the role of technology in facilitating negotiations. Emotional intelligence, in particular, has emerged as a critical component of effective negotiation, enabling negotiators to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics and respond to the emotional needs of their counterparts. Additionally, the increasing globalization of business has underscored the necessity for cultural sensitivity in negotiation practices, as negotiators must be adept at understanding and respecting diverse cultural norms and values.

### Guest Experience

The guest experience literature highlights the significance of service quality, emotional connections, and the role of technology in shaping guest interactions. Recent studies have focused on the impact of personalization and the importance of understanding guest preferences and expectations. Service quality has been evaluated through various models, including the SERVQUAL model, which assesses service delivery based on dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. The emotional connections formed between guests and service providers have been shown to significantly influence guest satisfaction and loyalty, highlighting the need for hospitality professionals to cultivate meaningful relationships with their clients.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich literature in both fields, there is a lack of research exploring the intersection of negotiation and guest experience. Key gaps include:
- The absence of frameworks that integrate negotiation principles into hospitality practices.
- Limited empirical studies examining the impact of negotiation skills on guest satisfaction and loyalty.
- A need for practical applications of negotiation techniques in service recovery and conflict resolution.

This dissertation seeks to address these gaps by developing a comprehensive framework that incorporates negotiation principles into guest experience management, ultimately enhancing service delivery and guest satisfaction.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Negotiation Theories

- **Interest-Based Negotiation**: This theory emphasizes understanding the underlying interests of all parties involved in a negotiation process. By focusing on interests rather than positions, negotiators can identify mutually beneficial solutions that satisfy the needs of all stakeholders.
  
- **Dual Concern Model**: This model posits that negotiators must balance their concern for their own outcomes with their concern for the outcomes of others. Effective negotiation requires a delicate interplay between self-interest and empathy, fostering collaborative solutions that address the needs of all parties involved.

### Guest Experience Theories

- **Service Quality Model**: This model evaluates service delivery based on dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. It provides a framework for assessing and improving service quality in hospitality settings, emphasizing the importance of meeting and exceeding guest expectations.

- **Experience Economy**: This concept emphasizes the importance of memorable experiences in driving guest satisfaction and loyalty. In an increasingly competitive hospitality landscape, organizations must create unique and engaging experiences that resonate with guests on an emotional level.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Negotiation-Enhanced Guest Experience (NEGE)**: This framework combines negotiation principles with guest experience management, highlighting the role of negotiation skills in enhancing service delivery and guest satisfaction. The NEGE framework emphasizes the importance of active listening, empathy, and emotional management in fostering meaningful guest interactions.

- **Emotional Intelligence in Service (EIS)**: This construct applies emotional intelligence principles to enhance guest interactions. By equipping hospitality professionals with emotional intelligence skills, organizations can improve service quality and create more positive guest experiences.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model will illustrate the interconnections between negotiation principles and guest experience elements, highlighting how skills such as active listening, empathy, and emotional management can be applied to improve service delivery and guest satisfaction. This model will serve as a foundation for empirical testing and practical application, guiding hospitality professionals in their efforts to enhance guest interactions through negotiation strategies.
