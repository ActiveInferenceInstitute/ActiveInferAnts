# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Ecosystem Principles into Population Dynamics

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of ecological principles with population dynamics, creating a Shifted Domain that offers new insights into how interconnectedness, biodiversity, and resource dynamics shape population health. By examining the parallels between ecosystems and populations, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of population resilience and stability in the face of environmental challenges. The findings have the potential to transform both ecological and population biology, leading to new interdisciplinary approaches and practical applications in conservation and resource management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of two traditionally distinct fields: Ecosystem Science and Population Biology. Ecosystems are characterized by the interactions between organisms and their environment, encapsulated in concepts such as energy flow, nutrient cycling, and community dynamics. In contrast, population dynamics focuses on the statistical and biological factors affecting population sizes, including birth rates, death rates, immigration, and emigration. This dissertation will investigate how principles from ecosystem science, such as interconnectedness and biodiversity, can inform and reshape our understanding of population dynamics, thereby fostering a more integrated approach to biological research.

#### Table 1: Key Concepts in Ecosystem Science and Population Biology

| Ecosystem Science         | Population Biology         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Energy Flow              | Birth and Death Rates     |
| Nutrient Cycling         | Immigration and Emigration |
| Community Dynamics       | Population Structure       |
| Interconnectedness       | Genetic Variation          |
| Resilience               | Carrying Capacity          |

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge gaps between ecology and population biology, offering a holistic perspective on biological systems. Traditional studies in population dynamics often overlook the ecological context, focusing instead on individual species without considering the complex interdependencies that characterize ecosystems. The novelty of this approach is underscored by the integration of concepts like interconnectedness and biodiversity into the study of populations, which has been largely overlooked in conventional population studies. By synthesizing these two fields, this research endeavors to provide a comprehensive framework that enhances our understanding of population behavior in relation to ecological principles.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of interconnectedness and biodiversity in ecosystems inform our understanding of population dynamics?
2. What is the role of genetic diversity in enhancing population resilience to environmental stressors?
3. How do resource allocation patterns within populations influence growth and stability?
4. In what ways do keystone individuals contribute to the stability of populations within ecosystems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Science

Ecosystem science has evolved significantly since its inception, with foundational theories such as the Gaia Hypothesis positing that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system. This perspective emphasizes the interconnectedness of biotic and abiotic components, suggesting that life significantly influences the Earth's environment. Additionally, the concept of trophic levels elucidates the flow of energy through ecosystems, highlighting the roles of producers, consumers, and decomposers in maintaining ecological balance.

#### Population Biology

Population biology has developed key models to explain population dynamics, such as the Logistic Growth Model, which describes how populations grow in a limited environment and reach a carrying capacity. The Allee Effect, on the other hand, illustrates how populations may experience reduced fitness at low densities, underscoring the importance of social interactions in population viability. These foundational theories provide a framework for understanding population dynamics but often fail to account for ecological interactions that influence these processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in ecological modeling and population genetics have begun to bridge the gap between these two fields. For instance, ecological network analysis has emerged as a tool for understanding the complex interactions within ecosystems, while population genetics has provided insights into the role of genetic variation in population resilience. Interdisciplinary studies have started to connect these domains, revealing how ecological factors can influence population dynamics and vice versa. However, there remains a significant opportunity to further integrate these fields through the lens of the Shifted Domain.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the progress made in both ecology and population biology, there are notable gaps in research that fail to consider ecological principles in population studies. For example, many population models do not incorporate the effects of species interactions or environmental variability. The Shifted Domain presents opportunities for new methodologies and frameworks that could emerge from this integration, including the development of models that account for ecological interactions and their impact on population dynamics.

#### Table 2: Gaps and Opportunities in Current Research

| Field                 | Gap                                           | Opportunity for Integration                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Ecosystem Science     | Limited focus on population interactions      | Develop models incorporating population dynamics |
| Population Biology    | Neglect of ecological context                 | Integrate ecological principles into population studies |
| Conservation Biology  | Fragmented conservation strategies            | Create holistic conservation frameworks         |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theories

Key theories from ecosystem science, such as interconnectedness, energy flow, and resilience, provide a foundation for understanding how ecological principles can inform population dynamics. Interconnectedness emphasizes the relationships between species and their environments, while energy flow highlights the transfer of energy through trophic levels. Resilience refers to the ability of ecosystems to withstand disturbances and maintain functionality, a concept that can be applied to understanding population stability.

#### Population Theories

In population biology, foundational theories such as carrying capacity, density-dependent factors, and genetic drift provide insights into population behavior. Carrying capacity refers to the maximum number of individuals an environment can support, while density-dependent factors, such as competition and predation, influence population growth rates. Genetic drift, the random fluctuation of allele frequencies in a population, can also impact population dynamics, particularly in small populations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The Shifted Domain allows for the development of new theoretical constructs, such as **Interpopulation Dynamics** and **Genetic Resilience**. Interpopulation Dynamics focuses on the interactions between different populations within an ecosystem, emphasizing the role of species interactions in shaping population behavior. Genetic Resilience highlights the importance of genetic diversity in enhancing a population's ability to adapt to environmental changes, thereby contributing to overall population stability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes ecological and population dynamics theories to explain population behavior through an ecosystemic lens. This model will incorporate principles of interconnectedness, genetic diversity, and resource dynamics, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how these factors influence population resilience and stability.
