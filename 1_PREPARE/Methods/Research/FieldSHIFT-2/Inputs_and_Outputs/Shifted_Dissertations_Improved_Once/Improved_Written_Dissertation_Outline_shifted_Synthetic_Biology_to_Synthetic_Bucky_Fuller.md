## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

Biology has evolved from early observational studies to a complex discipline that integrates genetics, ecology, and evolutionary theory. The transition from reductionist approaches to systems thinking has allowed for a more holistic understanding of ecological interactions. Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy emerged as a response to mid-20th-century challenges, advocating for holistic, sustainable approaches to design. His concepts of synergetic geometry and resource efficiency challenged traditional design paradigms, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to global issues such as resource depletion and environmental degradation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Modern biology emphasizes systems thinking, ecological interactions, and sustainability, while Fuller’s principles focus on efficient resource use and innovative problem-solving. However, there remains a disconnect between these fields, presenting an opportunity for integration. Current architectural practices often overlook the potential of biological insights, leading to designs that are not fully optimized for ecological resilience. The literature reveals a growing interest in biomimicry and sustainability, yet comprehensive frameworks that merge these domains are still lacking.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Current literature lacks comprehensive frameworks that merge biological insights with design principles. This dissertation will address these gaps by proposing an integrated approach that fosters interdisciplinary dialogue and innovation. By exploring the synergies between biology and design, this research aims to create a foundation for new methodologies that prioritize ecological sustainability and resilience in urban environments.
