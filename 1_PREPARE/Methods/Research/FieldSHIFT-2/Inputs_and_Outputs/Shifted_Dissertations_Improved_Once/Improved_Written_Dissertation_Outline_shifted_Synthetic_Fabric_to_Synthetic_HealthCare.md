## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of the fabric industry and arts with health care represents a novel approach to patient-centered care. Historically, both domains have emphasized creativity, sustainability, and community involvement, yet they have remained largely distinct. The fabric industry, with its rich traditions of textile design and artistic expression, has long been recognized for its ability to evoke emotional responses and foster social connections. Meanwhile, health care has traditionally focused on clinical outcomes, often neglecting the aesthetic and experiential dimensions of patient care. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap, drawing on the rich traditions of textile design and artistic expression to inform and enhance health care practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize health care environments and patient experiences. By incorporating artistic elements and sustainable practices from the fabric industry, health care can evolve into a more holistic and engaging field. This novel approach not only addresses current challenges in patient engagement and satisfaction but also fosters a deeper connection between health care providers and the communities they serve. The integration of artistry into health care environments can lead to improved emotional well-being, reduced anxiety, and enhanced recovery outcomes for patients.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles from the fabric industry enhance the design and function of health care environments?
2. What is the impact of arts-based therapies on patient outcomes and satisfaction?
3. How can sustainability practices from the fabric industry be integrated into health care operations?
4. In what ways can community engagement initiatives, inspired by fabric workshops, empower patients in their health care journeys?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Fabric Industry's Evolution and Its Cultural Significance

The fabric industry has undergone significant transformations over centuries, evolving from traditional handcrafting techniques to modern industrial processes. Historically, textiles have been integral to cultural identity, serving not only as functional items but also as expressions of art and social status. The aesthetic qualities of fabric—its texture, color, and pattern—have played a critical role in shaping human experiences and interactions.

#### Examination of Health Care's Historical Focus on Patient Experience and Service Quality

In contrast, the health care sector has traditionally prioritized clinical efficiency and service quality, often at the expense of patient experience. The emergence of patient-centered care in the late 20th century marked a pivotal shift, emphasizing the importance of understanding patients' needs, preferences, and values. Despite this progress, many health care environments still lack the aesthetic and emotional considerations that are vital for fostering a supportive healing atmosphere.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Practices in Textile Design and Their Emphasis on Aesthetics and Functionality

Contemporary textile design emphasizes the interplay between aesthetics and functionality, with designers increasingly focusing on creating textiles that are not only visually appealing but also serve practical purposes. Innovations such as smart textiles and sustainable fabrics exemplify how the fabric industry is responding to contemporary challenges, including environmental concerns and technological advancements.

#### Review of Current Health Care Practices, Highlighting Challenges in Patient Engagement and Sustainability

Current health care practices face significant challenges, including rising costs, patient dissatisfaction, and environmental sustainability. Many health care facilities struggle to engage patients effectively, leading to suboptimal health outcomes. Furthermore, the environmental impact of health care operations, from waste generation to resource consumption, necessitates a reevaluation of practices to incorporate sustainability.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Patient-Centered Design within Health Care

Despite the growing recognition of the importance of patient-centered design, there remains a gap in the integration of aesthetic and artistic elements into health care environments. Many facilities continue to prioritize functionality over aesthetics, resulting in sterile and uninviting spaces that do not promote healing.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Integrating Artistic Practices into Therapeutic Settings

The potential for integrating artistic practices into therapeutic settings is vast. Arts-based therapies, such as music therapy, art therapy, and textile arts, have demonstrated efficacy in improving emotional well-being and promoting recovery among patients. By leveraging the principles of the fabric industry, health care can create more engaging and supportive environments that enhance patient experiences.

### Table of Alternative Outcomes

| Perspective | Potential Outcome | Implications |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Integration of Art | Enhanced patient satisfaction | Improved emotional well-being and recovery rates |
| Sustainability Practices | Reduced environmental impact | Cost savings and improved community health |
| Community Engagement | Empowered patients | Increased health literacy and participation in care decisions |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Aesthetic Theory: The Role of Aesthetics in Design and Its Impact on User Experience

Aesthetic theory posits that beauty and sensory experiences significantly influence human behavior and perceptions. In the context of health care, the aesthetic qualities of the environment can affect patients' emotional states, perceptions of care quality, and overall satisfaction. By applying aesthetic principles from the fabric industry, health care environments can be transformed into spaces that promote healing and comfort.

#### Community Engagement Theory: The Importance of Local Involvement in Creative Processes

Community engagement theory emphasizes the significance of local involvement in creative processes, highlighting how collaboration can lead to more meaningful and impactful outcomes. By involving patients, families, and local artists in the design and implementation of health care initiatives, providers can foster a sense of ownership and empowerment, ultimately improving health outcomes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Artistry in Care: A Model that Emphasizes the Integration of Artistic Elements into Health Care Design
