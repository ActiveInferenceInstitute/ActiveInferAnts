## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of entomology and hospitality represents a novel approach to understanding and enhancing guest experiences. Hymenoptera species exhibit remarkable social behaviors and adaptive strategies that can inform hospitality practices. For instance, the collective foraging strategies of ants and the intricate communication systems of bees offer valuable insights into optimizing teamwork and service delivery in hospitality. By examining these biological principles, we can create a framework for collective service intelligence and adaptive guest services, which can lead to enhanced guest experiences and operational efficiencies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two distinct fields, providing a fresh perspective on guest experience through the lens of biological principles. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of Hymenoptera concepts into actionable strategies for hospitality. By leveraging the adaptive strategies and social structures observed in these insects, this dissertation aims to pave the way for interdisciplinary research and innovative practices that can reshape the hospitality landscape. The potential to enhance guest satisfaction and operational efficiencies through these insights represents a significant contribution to both academic literature and industry practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Hymenoptera

The order Hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees, and wasps, is characterized by complex social structures and behaviors. Evolutionarily, these insects have developed sophisticated communication methods, such as pheromone signaling in ants and the waggle dance in bees, to coordinate group activities. Understanding these mechanisms provides a foundation for exploring how similar principles can be applied in hospitality settings to enhance teamwork and service delivery.

#### Development of Hospitality as an Industry

The hospitality industry has evolved significantly over the centuries, from ancient inns and taverns to contemporary hotels and resorts. Historical milestones include the establishment of the first luxury hotels in the 19th century and the rise of the service economy in the 20th century. This evolution has been marked by an increasing emphasis on guest satisfaction and personalized service, which aligns with the adaptive strategies observed in social insects.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Collective Intelligence in Social Insects

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of collective intelligence in social insects, demonstrating how these organisms solve complex problems through group collaboration. Research has shown that ants can optimize foraging routes and bees can effectively communicate the location of resources, leading to enhanced efficiency and productivity. These findings suggest that similar principles can be applied to hospitality, where teamwork and collaboration are crucial for delivering exceptional guest experiences.

#### Trends in Hospitality

Current trends in hospitality focus on personalization, technology integration, and sustainability. The use of data analytics to tailor guest experiences, the implementation of mobile technologies for service delivery, and the adoption of eco-friendly practices are reshaping the industry. However, there remains a significant gap in leveraging biological principles to further enhance these trends.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting biological principles with hospitality practices. This gap presents an opportunity to apply adaptive strategies from nature to enhance guest experiences. By exploring the intersection of these fields, this dissertation aims to fill this void and provide a framework for innovative hospitality practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Social Insect Theory

Social insect theory encompasses concepts related to collective behavior, task allocation, and communication. These principles can inform hospitality practices by promoting teamwork, enhancing service delivery, and improving guest satisfaction.

#### Service Management Theory

Service management theory focuses on guest satisfaction, service quality, and operational efficiency. By integrating insights from social insect theory, hospitality practitioners can develop more effective service delivery models that prioritize collaboration and adaptability.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Collective Service Intelligence

Collective service intelligence refers to the collaborative efforts of hospitality staff to enhance service delivery. This framework emphasizes teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, drawing parallels to the collective behaviors observed in social insects.

#### Adaptive Service Framework

The adaptive service framework encompasses strategies for real-time responsiveness to guest needs. By leveraging feedback mechanisms and data analytics, hospitality establishments can tailor their services to meet the evolving preferences of guests, similar to how social insects adapt to changing environmental conditions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model combining principles from Hymenoptera with hospitality management. The model illustrates the interconnections between social behavior in insects and service delivery in hospitality, providing a comprehensive framework for enhancing guest experiences through biological insights.
