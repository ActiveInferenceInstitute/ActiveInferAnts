## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Health Care
The evolution of health care from a provider-centric model to a patient-centered approach has been a significant development over the past few decades. This transformation emphasizes the importance of considering patients' needs, preferences, and values in the delivery of care. The rise of patient advocacy movements and the integration of technology in health care have further propelled this shift, leading to improved patient engagement and satisfaction.

#### Logistics
Historically, logistics has been focused on efficiency, cost management, and the optimization of supply chains. However, as customer expectations have evolved, logistics has begun to shift towards a greater emphasis on customer satisfaction and service quality. The integration of technology in logistics operations, such as real-time tracking and automated systems, has enabled companies to respond more effectively to customer needs.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
In health care, the focus on service quality, patient experience, and technology integration has led to the development of various frameworks and models aimed at improving care delivery. Concepts such as the Patient Experience Framework and the Service Quality Model have become integral to health care practice.

Conversely, the logistics field has seen a growing recognition of the importance of customer satisfaction and service quality. The adoption of frameworks such as the SERVQUAL model has allowed logistics companies to assess and improve their service delivery.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in research concerning the application of health care principles in logistics. This gap presents an opportunity to explore how interdisciplinary approaches can enhance customer experience and service quality in logistics. By leveraging insights from health care, logistics can develop more holistic and customer-centric models that address contemporary challenges.
