## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### ATM Transactions

The evolution of ATM transactions from manual banking to automated systems has revolutionized the banking industry. Initially, banking transactions required physical presence, leading to long wait times and inefficiencies. The introduction of ATMs in the late 20th century allowed users to perform transactions independently, significantly enhancing user experience. The development of security protocols, such as the Personal Identification Number (PIN), and user interface design has further improved the safety and accessibility of these systems.

#### Chemical Reactions

Historically, the understanding of chemical reactions has evolved through rigorous experimentation and theoretical advancements. Early chemists, such as Antoine Lavoisier, laid the groundwork for modern chemistry by establishing principles of conservation of mass and reaction stoichiometry. Over time, the development of catalysts and the understanding of reaction mechanisms have transformed synthetic chemistry, yet challenges in predictability and reproducibility persist.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### ATM Transactions

Current advancements in ATM technology include enhanced security measures, such as biometric authentication and machine learning algorithms for fraud detection. User interface design has also evolved to prioritize accessibility and user satisfaction, with many ATMs now offering customizable options for frequent users.

#### Chemical Reactions

In the field of chemistry, significant challenges remain in predicting reaction outcomes and achieving reproducibility. The complexity of reaction mechanisms often leads to unexpected results, and the role of catalysts in enhancing reaction efficiency is an area of ongoing research. Recent advancements in computational chemistry and machine learning offer promising avenues for improving predictive models, yet the integration of these technologies into traditional laboratory practices remains limited.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that integrate user experience design into chemical education and practice. This dissertation identifies opportunities for applying user-centric methodologies to enhance the predictability and efficiency of chemical reactions, thereby addressing existing challenges in the field.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User-Centered Design Theory

User-Centered Design (UCD) is a framework that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and limitations of end-users at every stage of the design process. This theory emphasizes the importance of usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction, making it a valuable lens through which to examine chemical reaction design.

#### Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Chemical kinetics and thermodynamics are fundamental theories governing reaction rates and energy changes. Kinetics explores the speed of reactions and the factors influencing it, while thermodynamics examines the energy changes associated with chemical processes. These theories provide a scientific basis for understanding how reactions occur and can be manipulated.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### User-Centric Reaction Design

This framework proposes designing chemical reactions that prioritize user experience, considering factors such as ease of execution, predictability of outcomes, and accessibility of information. By applying UCD principles, chemists can develop methodologies that are more intuitive and user-friendly.

#### Dynamic Reaction Monitoring

Dynamic Reaction Monitoring (DRM) integrates real-time feedback into chemical experimentation, allowing for immediate adjustments based on observed results. This concept parallels real-time transaction monitoring in ATMs, where users receive instant feedback on their actions, enhancing the overall experience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The "Reaction ATM" paradigm combines user interaction principles with chemical reaction pathways. This model envisions a system where chemical reactions are treated as transactions, with users navigating through a structured process that includes real-time feedback and customizable parameters.
