## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Neural Networks
The evolution of neural networks can be traced from the early perceptrons of the 1950s, which were simplistic models of neurons, to the sophisticated deep learning architectures that dominate the field today. The introduction of backpropagation in the 1980s marked a significant milestone, enabling multilayer networks to learn complex patterns. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been pivotal in image recognition and natural language processing, respectively. The exploration of concepts such as transfer learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) has further expanded the capabilities of neural networks, leading to innovative applications across diverse domains.

#### Blockchain
Blockchain technology emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, representing a novel approach to secure digital transactions through decentralized consensus. Over the years, the technology has evolved, leading to the development of various blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, which introduced smart contracts, and Hyperledger, which focuses on enterprise solutions. Despite these advancements, challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and interoperability among different blockchain networks continue to hinder widespread adoption. The emergence of layer-2 solutions and sharding techniques has offered some respite, yet these solutions often come with trade-offs that require further investigation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Neural Networks
Current methodologies in neural networks include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Applications span diverse fields, from image and speech recognition to game playing and autonomous driving. However, limitations persist, including the need for large datasets, susceptibility to adversarial attacks, and challenges in interpretability. The development of explainable AI (XAI) is a burgeoning area of research aimed at addressing these concerns, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of neural models.

#### Blockchain
The current state of blockchain technology is characterized by the exploration of various consensus mechanisms, including proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), and delegated proof of stake (DPoS). Despite the innovation in these areas, scalability remains a pressing issue, as evidenced by network congestion during peak usage times. Additionally, the energy-intensive nature of PoW has raised environmental concerns, prompting the search for more sustainable alternatives. Recent proposals, such as proof of authority (PoA) and proof of space, offer potential pathways to resolve these challenges, yet they require rigorous validation through empirical studies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a significant gap in the integration of adaptive systems within blockchain technology. Existing blockchain systems predominantly rely on static consensus mechanisms and rigid smart contracts, which lack the ability to evolve based on user interactions or environmental changes. This dissertation posits that principles derived from neural networks can address these shortcomings, creating a more responsive and efficient decentralized system. Furthermore, the exploration of multi-layered architectures inspired by neural processing could significantly enhance blockchain scalability and performance.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Neural Networks
Key theories underpinning neural networks include interconnectedness, which describes how neurons communicate through synapses; plasticity, which refers to the ability of neural connections to strengthen or weaken over time based on experience; and parallel processing, which allows for simultaneous information processing across multiple pathways. These principles not only enhance learning capabilities but also facilitate the development of more robust and adaptive systems.

#### Blockchain
The foundational theories of blockchain technology include decentralization, which eliminates the need for a central authority; immutability, which ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered; and consensus mechanisms, which facilitate agreement among distributed nodes on the state of the blockchain. The integration of these theories with adaptive neural principles can lead to innovative solutions that address current limitations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation introduces "Neurochain" as a theoretical construct that synthesizes the principles of neural networks with blockchain technology. Additionally, the concept of "Adaptive Consensus" is proposed, which draws on the notion of synaptic plasticity to create dynamic consensus mechanisms that adjust based on network conditions and transaction patterns. The framework will also incorporate concepts from complex systems theory to model the emergent behavior of adaptive blockchain networks.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integrated theoretical model will illustrate the interplay between neural principles and blockchain functionalities, highlighting adaptive mechanisms and the evolution of smart contracts. This model serves as the foundation for the subsequent development of methodologies and applications discussed in this dissertation.
