## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Culinary Theory
Culinary theory encompasses various concepts, including flavor profiles, cooking methods, and the science of fermentation. Flavor profiles can be understood as the combination of taste, aroma, and texture, which together create a holistic sensory experience. Cooking methods, ranging from boiling to sous-vide, dictate how ingredients interact and transform, while fermentation introduces a dynamic process of evolution and change.
