## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework that posits that biological systems strive to minimize their free energy, which can be understood as the difference between expected sensory input and actual sensory input. This principle suggests that living organisms continuously update their internal models of the world to reduce uncertainty and maintain homeostasis. In healthcare, the FEP can be applied to enhance patient experiences and outcomes by framing care as a dynamic process of prediction and adaptation. This shift from traditional, reactive models of healthcare to proactive, predictive frameworks allows for a more nuanced understanding of patient-provider interactions and the complexities of health behavior.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges the gap between cognitive science and healthcare, introducing innovative methodologies for improving patient-provider interactions. The novelty lies in the systematic application of FEP concepts, such as predictive processing and active inference, to real-world healthcare challenges. By leveraging insights from cognitive science, this dissertation aims to create a more responsive healthcare system that emphasizes patient engagement and satisfaction. The integration of FEP into healthcare practices not only offers theoretical advancements but also practical applications that can transform patient care.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation will address the following key research questions:

1. How can the Free Energy Principle be operationalized to enhance patient care in healthcare settings?
2. What is the impact of predictive processing on patient satisfaction and health outcomes?
3. In what ways can active patient engagement reduce variational free energy in treatment adherence?
4. How do Markov blankets influence the quality of patient-provider communication?

The objectives of this research include developing a comprehensive framework for integrating FEP into healthcare practices, evaluating the effects of predictive processing and active inference on patient outcomes, and identifying strategies for improving communication and engagement between patients and providers.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in statistical mechanics and information theory, gaining prominence in cognitive science as a means to understand brain function and behavior. The development of this principle has been informed by key theories such as predictive coding and Bayesian inference, which emphasize the brain's role in continuously predicting and updating its understanding of the environment. In the realm of healthcare, patient care models have evolved from paternalistic approaches to more collaborative frameworks that prioritize patient autonomy and engagement. This historical context provides a foundation for understanding how FEP can be applied to enhance patient care.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in FEP has highlighted its implications for understanding adaptive systems, with studies demonstrating its relevance in various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. In healthcare, research has increasingly focused on patient-centered care models that emphasize the importance of communication, shared decision-making, and patient engagement. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that specifically integrates FEP concepts into healthcare practices. This section will analyze key findings and methodologies that have shaped current practices in both cognitive science and healthcare, illuminating the need for further exploration of their intersection.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying gaps in existing literature is crucial for advancing interdisciplinary research that integrates FEP into healthcare. While there is a growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of patient-centered care, few studies have explicitly applied FEP concepts to healthcare settings. This dissertation aims to articulate the need for innovative research that leverages FEP to address longstanding challenges in healthcare delivery, such as treatment adherence, patient satisfaction, and effective communication. By highlighting these gaps, this research will underscore the potential for FEP to provide novel solutions and frameworks for enhancing patient care.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories from cognitive science, such as predictive coding and Bayesian inference, underpin the Free Energy Principle and provide a basis for understanding adaptive behavior in biological systems. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on incoming information, thereby minimizing prediction error. Bayesian inference extends this idea by suggesting that the brain combines prior knowledge with new evidence to form updated beliefs about the world. These foundational theories are critical for understanding how FEP can be applied to healthcare, as they emphasize the importance of prediction and adaptation in shaping behavior and experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The application of FEP to healthcare gives rise to new theoretical constructs, including Predictive Care and Active Patient Engagement. Predictive Care refers to a model of healthcare that prioritizes proactive, anticipatory approaches to patient needs, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing patients' expectations and preferences. Active Patient Engagement involves empowering patients to take an active role in their healthcare decisions, fostering collaboration between patients and providers. These constructs reflect the potential for FEP to inform innovative approaches to patient care that prioritize collaboration, communication, and adaptability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will be developed to illustrate the interplay between FEP components and healthcare processes. This model will visually represent the relationships between predictive processing, active inference, and patient-provider interactions, highlighting how these elements work together to enhance patient care. By providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the application of FEP in healthcare, this model will serve as a foundation for subsequent research and practical applications.
