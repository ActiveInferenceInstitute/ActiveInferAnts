# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The healthcare sector is increasingly integrating technology to improve patient care and streamline operations. Concurrently, the banking sector has perfected self-service transaction systems through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), which provide secure, efficient, and user-friendly experiences. The evolution of ATMs has fundamentally transformed banking practices by enabling customers to perform transactions independently, thus reducing wait times and increasing customer satisfaction. This dissertation proposes a unique synthesis of these two domains, exploring how ATM transaction principles can be effectively applied to healthcare.

In healthcare, the integration of technology has been gradual, often hindered by legacy systems, regulatory barriers, and a lack of patient-centered design. However, the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, and mobile health applications signifies a shift towards more technology-driven care models. The intersection of these two domains presents an opportunity to enhance healthcare delivery through self-service technologies akin to ATMs, allowing patients to manage their healthcare more effectively.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for patient-centered care through innovative technological solutions. The novelty lies in the systematic application of well-established banking practices to healthcare, offering new insights into patient engagement and operational efficiency. By framing healthcare processes within the context of ATM transactions, this dissertation aims to elucidate how self-service technologies can empower patients, enhance their experiences, and improve health outcomes.

Furthermore, the research underscores the importance of data privacy and security, drawing parallels with the stringent measures employed in the banking sector. The potential implications of this interdisciplinary approach extend beyond theoretical contributions; they hold the promise of practical applications that can revolutionize patient experiences and outcomes in the healthcare system.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Domain A: ATM Transactions

The evolution of ATMs began in the late 1960s, with the introduction of the first cash dispensing machine. Over the decades, ATMs have undergone significant transformations, incorporating advanced technologies such as card readers, biometric authentication, and mobile integration. The impact of ATMs on banking efficiency cannot be overstated; they have reduced operational costs, minimized human error, and increased customer accessibility. The development of security protocols, including encryption and multi-factor authentication, has further enhanced the safety of transactions, instilling trust in users.

### Domain B: Health Care

The historical development of patient-centered care models has evolved from a paternalistic approach to one that emphasizes patient autonomy and engagement. The introduction of EHRs in the 1990s marked a significant milestone in the integration of technology in healthcare, enabling better data management and communication among providers. However, challenges remain, including interoperability issues, data privacy concerns, and the need for user-friendly interfaces that empower patients to take control of their health.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### ATM Transactions

Current trends in banking technology highlight a shift towards digital banking, with many consumers preferring online and mobile banking solutions over traditional ATMs. Innovations such as contactless payments and virtual ATMs are reshaping customer interactions, emphasizing convenience and security. The banking sector continues to explore ways to enhance customer service through technology, focusing on personalized experiences and seamless transactions.

### Health Care

In healthcare, existing technologies such as telehealth platforms and patient portals have shown promise in improving patient outcomes. Studies indicate that telehealth can increase access to care, reduce costs, and enhance patient satisfaction. However, the effectiveness of these technologies often hinges on patient engagement, which remains variable across different demographics. The integration of self-service technologies has the potential to bridge this gap, fostering greater patient involvement in their care.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research linking banking technology with healthcare. The application of self-service models from banking to healthcare presents opportunities for enhancing patient engagement and operational efficiencies. By examining the principles that underpin ATM transactions, this dissertation seeks to identify strategies that can be adapted to improve healthcare delivery and patient experiences.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical underpinnings of this research draw from two primary constructs: self-service technology theory from banking and patient empowerment theories in healthcare. Self-service technology theory posits that providing customers with the tools to manage their transactions enhances satisfaction and efficiency. In healthcare, patient empowerment theories emphasize the importance of involving patients in their care decisions, leading to improved health outcomes and satisfaction.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes the development of a hybrid model that integrates self-service and patient empowerment theories. This model envisions a healthcare environment where patients are equipped with the tools and knowledge necessary to actively participate in their care. The integration of self-service technologies can facilitate this engagement, enabling patients to access information, manage appointments, and communicate with providers seamlessly.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The "Healthcare ATM Model" illustrates the flow of patient interactions and data security protocols, drawing parallels to the transaction processes seen in banking. This model emphasizes the importance of user-friendly interfaces, standardized procedures, and robust security measures to ensure a positive patient experience. By mapping out the patient journey in a manner akin to ATM transactions, this model aims to provide a comprehensive framework for enhancing healthcare delivery.

# Methodology

Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with healthcare providers and patients. Surveys will be designed to assess perceptions of self-service technologies, while interviews will provide deeper insights into experiences and expectations. Additionally, case studies of existing self-service implementations in healthcare settings will be conducted to identify best practices and lessons learned.

### Testable Hypotheses

1. Patients who utilize self-service technologies will report higher levels of engagement and satisfaction compared to those who do not.
2. Standardized care pathways based on ATM transaction flows will result in improved continuity of care and reduced patient wait times.
3. The integration of robust data security measures will enhance patient trust and willingness to use self-service technologies in healthcare.

## Analytical Approaches

Quantitative data from surveys will be analyzed using statistical methods to identify trends and correlations. Qualitative data from interviews will undergo thematic analysis, allowing for the identification of key themes and patterns related to patient engagement and technology use. This dual approach will enhance the robustness of the findings.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensuring patient confidentiality and adherence to HIPAA regulations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and data will be anonymized to protect their identities. Ethical considerations will also extend to the responsible reporting of findings, ensuring that the implications of the research are communicated accurately and sensitively.
