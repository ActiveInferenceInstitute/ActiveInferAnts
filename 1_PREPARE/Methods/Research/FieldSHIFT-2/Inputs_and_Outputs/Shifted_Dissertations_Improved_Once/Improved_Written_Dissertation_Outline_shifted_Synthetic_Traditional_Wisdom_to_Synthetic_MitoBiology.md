# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into the Context of Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and mitochondrial biology, presenting a transformative perspective on cellular health and sustainability. By integrating principles of sustainability, cultural narratives, adaptive resilience, and interconnectedness from TK into the framework of mitochondrial function, this research seeks to develop new hypotheses, models, and practical applications that bridge these two distinct domains. The anticipated impact includes advancing scientific understanding, informing health interventions, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations that honor both empirical science and cultural wisdom. This exploration will not only enhance our understanding of mitochondrial health but also promote the preservation and respect for indigenous knowledge systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Traditional Knowledge and mitochondrial biology represents a novel approach to understanding cellular health. Traditional Knowledge encompasses holistic, sustainable practices rooted in cultural contexts, often passed down through generations and deeply intertwined with local ecosystems. These practices emphasize the importance of balance, respect for nature, and the interconnectedness of all living beings. Mitochondrial biology, on the other hand, focuses on the cellular organelles responsible for energy production, metabolic regulation, and signaling pathways critical for maintaining cellular health. This dissertation will explore how these domains can inform and enhance each other, offering a new lens through which to examine health and disease.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms in both fields, proposing that traditional ecological practices can provide insights into mitochondrial function and health. The novelty lies in the development of a new lexicon and theoretical frameworks that facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular processes through the lens of traditional ecological wisdom. By bridging these domains, this dissertation aims to create a dialogue that respects and incorporates indigenous knowledge while advancing scientific inquiry. 

The integration of TK into mitochondrial biology not only enriches scientific discourse but also promotes a more holistic view of health, where cultural practices and scientific understanding coexist and complement each other. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of Traditional Knowledge inform our understanding of mitochondrial health and function?
2. What new models can be developed from the integration of TK and mitochondrial biology?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach lead to practical applications in health and disease management?
4. In what ways can the narratives embedded in Traditional Knowledge enhance our understanding of mitochondrial processes?
