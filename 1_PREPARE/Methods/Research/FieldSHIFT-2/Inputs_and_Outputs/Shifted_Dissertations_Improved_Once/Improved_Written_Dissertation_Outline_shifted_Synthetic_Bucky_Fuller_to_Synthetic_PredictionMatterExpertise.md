## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor known for his innovative and sustainable design principles. His seminal works, including "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" and "The Dymaxion World Map," emphasize the interconnectedness of global systems and the necessity for sustainable living. Fuller's design philosophy advocates for the efficient use of resources and the creation of solutions that benefit humanity while maintaining ecological balance. His concepts of "ephemeralization" and "synergetics" lay the groundwork for understanding how complex systems can be optimized for sustainability.

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) has evolved significantly since its inception, focusing on the use of data analytics and modeling to forecast outcomes in various fields, including economics, healthcare, and environmental science. PME encompasses methodologies such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and systems thinking, which are employed to enhance decision-making processes. As the complexity of global challenges grows, the significance of PME has become increasingly apparent, necessitating a more integrated approach that considers sustainability. However, the traditional frameworks of PME often overlook the ecological and social dimensions of predictive accuracy, leading to potential long-term consequences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature on Fuller's design principles reveals a growing interest in applying his ideas to contemporary challenges, particularly in the context of sustainability and systemic thinking. However, there remains a gap in the application of these principles within predictive analytics. In PME, while there is a robust body of research focusing on methodologies, there is a noticeable lack of integration of sustainability metrics into predictive models. This highlights a critical opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

This research identifies opportunities to develop frameworks that incorporate Fuller's principles into PME, fostering a more responsible and adaptive approach to prediction. By bridging these domains, the research aims to create a foundation for new interdisciplinary collaborations that can address complex global challenges. 

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Design Science

Key principles from Fuller’s work emphasize sustainability, interconnectedness, and the importance of viewing systems holistically. Fuller's design science advocates for solutions that are not only innovative but also responsible, considering the broader implications of design decisions. This perspective is essential for developing predictive models that account for environmental and social impacts. The notion of "design as a verb" encourages a proactive approach to problem-solving, urging practitioners to consider the long-term effects of their decisions.

#### Predictive Analytics

Core theories underpinning PME include statistical modeling, machine learning, and systems thinking. These methodologies provide the tools necessary for analyzing complex data sets and generating forecasts. However, the integration of sustainability metrics into these models remains a critical area for development. The challenge lies in reconciling the often conflicting objectives of predictive accuracy and ecological responsibility.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Sustainable Prediction Framework

The Sustainable Prediction Framework (SPF) proposes a model that incorporates sustainability metrics into predictive analytics. This framework encourages the evaluation of predictions not only based on accuracy but also on their potential environmental and social impacts. By introducing qualitative metrics alongside quantitative data, the SPF aims to create a more nuanced understanding of predictive outcomes.

#### Synergetic Prediction

Synergetic Prediction focuses on emergent properties in complex systems, emphasizing the interactions between components rather than treating them in isolation. This theoretical approach aligns with Fuller's holistic perspective, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of predictive outcomes. By leveraging synergetic principles, predictive models can better account for the non-linear dynamics inherent in complex systems.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The Tensegrity Decision Framework (TDF) is proposed as an integrated model that merges Fuller's principles with PME methodologies. TDF emphasizes flexibility and resilience in decision-making, allowing organizations to adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining a focus on sustainability. The framework draws on the concept of tensegrity, which represents a structural system that maintains its integrity through a balance of tension and compression, mirroring the need for equilibrium in decision-making processes.
