# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Spatial Web

The Spatial Web has evolved from earlier concepts of augmented reality and the Internet of Things, which focused on enhancing user interactions through digital overlays and interconnected devices. Key milestones include the development of AR applications for navigation and gaming, as well as the rise of IoT technologies that facilitate real-time data sharing. The Spatial Web represents a significant evolution in how users engage with their environments, enabling immersive experiences that blend the digital and physical worlds. 

Theoretical advancements in this field, such as the concept of "mixed reality" and "ubiquitous computing," have further enriched the understanding of how spatial technologies can be utilized to create engaging user experiences. 

### Guest Experience

Historically, guest experience management has centered on service quality and personalization. The emergence of technology in hospitality has shifted this focus, introducing new tools for enhancing service delivery and guest satisfaction, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems and mobile applications. Traditional models of guest experience often emphasize human interaction, but the integration of technology has prompted a re-evaluation of how services are delivered and experienced.

As the landscape of guest expectations evolves, so too must the frameworks that govern guest experience management. This dissertation aims to explore how technology can augment traditional service models, creating a more dynamic and responsive hospitality environment.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Spatial Web

Current research in the Spatial Web emphasizes the potential of AR and IoT in various industries, including retail and education. However, there is limited exploration of its application in hospitality, presenting a unique opportunity for investigation. Studies have shown that AR can enhance user engagement by providing contextually relevant information, while IoT devices can streamline operations and improve guest comfort. Nevertheless, the hospitality sector remains underexplored in terms of these technologies' full potential.

The existing literature often lacks a comprehensive analysis of the interdependencies between these technologies and their collective impact on guest experience. This dissertation seeks to fill this void by examining the synergistic effects of the Spatial Web technologies within the hospitality context.

### Guest Experience

The hospitality industry has increasingly adopted technology to improve guest experiences, yet there remains a gap in understanding how emerging technologies can be systematically integrated to create a holistic guest experience. Existing literature often focuses on individual technologies rather than their synergistic effects. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring how the Spatial Web can be leveraged to create a more integrated approach to guest experience management.

By synthesizing insights from various studies, this dissertation will highlight the necessity of a multi-faceted approach to technology integration, one that considers the interconnected nature of guest experiences.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of the Spatial Web and guest experience reveals several gaps in the literature, including:
- Lack of comprehensive models that integrate digital technologies into guest experience management.
- Insufficient empirical research on the effectiveness of AR, IoT, and blockchain in enhancing hospitality services.
- Need for frameworks that address the ethical implications of data use in guest interactions.

These gaps present significant opportunities for further research, particularly in developing a cohesive understanding of how these technologies can work together to enhance guest experiences.

### Table 1: Gaps and Opportunities in Literature

| Gap Identified | Opportunities for Research |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Lack of integrated models | Develop comprehensive frameworks for technology integration. |
| Insufficient empirical research | Conduct case studies and empirical analysis of technology impacts. |
| Ethical implications of data use | Explore ethical frameworks for data management in hospitality. |
