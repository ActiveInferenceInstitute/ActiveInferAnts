## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience as a key driver of satisfaction and loyalty. This emphasis on creating memorable, personalized experiences has been shown to enhance customer retention and foster brand allegiance. In contrast, the ATM user experience has traditionally focused on efficiency and usability, often neglecting the holistic interaction that users have with these machines. This oversight can lead to user frustration and dissatisfaction, ultimately impacting the financial institution's reputation and customer loyalty.

This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by applying hospitality principles to enhance the ATM user experience. By leveraging insights from the hospitality sector, this research aims to create a more engaging and fulfilling interaction for users, thus transforming the perception of ATMs from mere transactional devices to integral components of customer service in banking.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to transpose established guest experience frameworks onto the ATM landscape, thereby creating a new paradigm for user interaction in financial services. The significance lies in its potential to revolutionize how users perceive and interact with ATMs, ultimately leading to enhanced satisfaction and engagement. By focusing on the integration of hospitality principles, this study aims to provide actionable insights for financial institutions seeking to differentiate themselves in a competitive market.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be effectively integrated into ATM user experience?
2. What impact does personalization have on user satisfaction and transaction efficiency at ATMs?
3. What are the implications of sustainable practices in ATM operations on user perceptions and brand loyalty?
4. How can technology enhance the ATM user experience while addressing privacy concerns?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the decades. Early models focused on basic service delivery, emphasizing efficiency and consistency. However, as competition intensified, the industry began to recognize the importance of creating memorable experiences. Pioneering works, such as Pine and Gilmore's (1999) "The Experience Economy," introduced the idea that experiences could be staged and designed to engage customers on an emotional level, thereby fostering loyalty and advocacy. 

**Table 1: Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality**
| Year | Key Development | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1990s | Service Quality Focus | Emphasis on efficiency and consistency in service delivery. |
| 2000s | Experience Economy | Recognition of the importance of emotional engagement. |
| 2010s | Personalization | Tailoring experiences to individual preferences. |
| 2020s | Digital Integration | Incorporation of technology to enhance guest interactions. |

#### Historical Development of ATM Technology and User Experience

The development of ATM technology dates back to the late 1960s, with the first machines primarily serving as cash dispensers. Over the years, advancements in technology have transformed ATMs into multifunctional devices capable of performing various banking transactions. However, the focus has largely remained on functionality rather than user experience. Recent studies highlight a growing recognition of the need to enhance the user experience at ATMs, but a comprehensive framework integrating hospitality principles remains absent.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Research in Guest Experience and Its Core Principles

Current research in guest experience emphasizes several core principles, including personalization, service quality, and emotional engagement. Scholars such as Lemon and Verhoef (2016) have expanded on the Customer Experience Management framework, identifying the importance of touchpoints and customer journeys in shaping overall satisfaction. This body of work underscores the necessity of viewing customer interactions holistically, considering both emotional and functional aspects.

#### Examination of Current ATM User Experience Studies and Practices

Recent studies on ATM user experience have begun to address the limitations of traditional approaches. Research indicates that users often experience frustration due to long wait times, unclear instructions, and a lack of personalization. Innovative practices, such as user-centered design and real-time feedback mechanisms, have been proposed to enhance the ATM experience. However, these studies often fall short of exploring the potential benefits of applying hospitality principles to ATM interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary research connecting hospitality and banking. While both fields emphasize the importance of customer experience, there is limited exploration of how principles from hospitality can be applied to enhance ATM user experiences. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for synergy between these domains, ultimately contributing to a more user-centered approach in financial services.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory (Parasuraman et al.)

Service Quality Theory, developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), posits that service quality is a critical determinant of customer satisfaction and loyalty. The model identifies several dimensions of service quality, including reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. These dimensions provide a useful framework for evaluating ATM user experiences and identifying areas for improvement.

**Table 2: Dimensions of Service Quality**
| Dimension    | Description                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Reliability   | Ability to perform promised service dependably. |
| Responsiveness | Willingness to help customers and provide prompt service. |
| Assurance      | Knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to inspire trust. |
| Empathy        | Caring, individualized attention to customers. |
| Tangibles      | Physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of personnel. |

#### Customer Experience Management (Lemon & Verhoef)

Lemon and Verhoef (2016) expand upon the concept of customer experience management, emphasizing the importance of understanding the entire customer journey. Their framework highlights the significance of touchpoints and interactions in shaping overall satisfaction and loyalty. This perspective will be instrumental in analyzing the ATM user experience and identifying opportunities for enhancement.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Personalized User Experience Model for ATMs

Building upon existing theories, this research proposes a Personalized User Experience Model for ATMs that emphasizes the importance of tailoring interactions to individual user preferences. This model will explore how personalization can enhance user satisfaction and engagement, ultimately leading to improved transaction efficiency.

**Hypothesis 1:** Personalized ATM interfaces will lead to higher user satisfaction compared to traditional interfaces.

#### Feedback-Driven Improvement Loop in Banking Services

Another emerging construct is the Feedback-Driven Improvement Loop, which emphasizes the importance of continuous feedback from users to drive service improvements. This model will explore how financial institutions can leverage user insights to enhance ATM experiences and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

**Hypothesis 2:** Implementing a feedback-driven improvement loop will result in measurable enhancements in user satisfaction at ATMs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model will combine elements from Service Quality Theory, Customer Experience Management, and the new constructs of personalized user experience and feedback-driven improvement. This comprehensive model will highlight key interactions, personalization, and feedback mechanisms, providing a robust framework for analyzing and enhancing the ATM user experience.
