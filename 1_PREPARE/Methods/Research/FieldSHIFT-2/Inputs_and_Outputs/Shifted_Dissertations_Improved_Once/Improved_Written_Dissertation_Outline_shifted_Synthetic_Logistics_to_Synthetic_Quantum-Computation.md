## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fields of logistics and quantum computation have evolved independently, each with its own set of principles and practices. Logistics focuses on the efficient movement and management of goods and services, employing strategies such as supply chain management, inventory control, and distribution optimization. These practices are underpinned by theories such as systems theory and operations research, which emphasize efficiency, cost reduction, and responsiveness to customer demand.

In contrast, quantum computation leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways. Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to perform calculations that would be infeasible for classical computers. Key concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates form the foundation of quantum algorithms, which have the potential to solve complex problems across various domains.

The intersection of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to enhance the capabilities of quantum computing through established logistics methodologies. By applying logistics principles to quantum resource management, error correction, and network resilience, this research aims to unlock new efficiencies and capabilities in quantum computing.
