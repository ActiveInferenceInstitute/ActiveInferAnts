# PhD Dissertation: Culinary Practices through the Lens of the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of culinary practices and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a comprehensive framework that views cuisine as an adaptive system striving to minimize free energy. By analyzing how flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and culinary fusion can be understood through predictive coding and variational free energy, this research seeks to redefine the culinary arts and enhance the dining experience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of culinary arts and the Free Energy Principle represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding cooking as a dynamic, adaptive system. Traditional culinary practices have often been viewed in isolation, neglecting the cognitive and environmental factors that influence flavor optimization. The Free Energy Principle, rooted in cognitive neuroscience and systems theory, provides a robust framework for analyzing these practices in a novel context. This principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize the difference between their internal predictions and external sensory inputs, thereby maintaining a state of homeostasis. In culinary contexts, this can be interpreted as chefs continuously refining their techniques and flavor profiles in response to sensory feedback and environmental variables.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields—culinary arts and cognitive science—creating a new paradigm for understanding and innovating culinary practices. By applying principles of predictive coding and free energy minimization, the dissertation will provide insights into how chefs can refine their techniques and enhance flavor experiences. The novelty of this research lies not only in its interdisciplinary approach but also in its potential to transform culinary education and practice, encouraging chefs to adopt a more scientific approach to their craft.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Culinary Arts

The culinary arts have evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural, social, and technological changes. From the early days of cooking over open flames to the intricate techniques of modern gastronomy, the evolution of cooking techniques reflects broader societal shifts. Flavor profiles have also developed, shaped by the availability of ingredients, regional preferences, and historical trade routes. The significance of culinary practices extends beyond mere sustenance; they embody cultural identity, social bonding, and artistic expression.

#### Introduction to the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems are driven by a fundamental imperative to minimize surprise or uncertainty in their interactions with the environment. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes, suggesting that organisms continuously generate predictions about sensory inputs and adjust their behavior to reduce prediction errors. In recent years, the FEP has gained traction in various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence, prompting a reevaluation of adaptive systems across disciplines.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Contemporary Culinary Trends

Current culinary trends, such as molecular gastronomy and fusion cuisine, exemplify the dynamic nature of cooking practices. Molecular gastronomy, characterized by the application of scientific principles to cooking, has revolutionized traditional techniques by introducing new methods of flavor extraction, texture manipulation, and presentation. Fusion cuisine, on the other hand, reflects the blending of diverse culinary traditions, resulting in innovative flavor combinations and techniques. These trends highlight the potential for culinary practices to be understood through the lens of cognitive science, particularly in terms of prediction and adaptation.

#### Research on the Free Energy Principle

Research on the Free Energy Principle has primarily focused on its implications for adaptive systems, emphasizing the role of predictive coding in perception, decision-making, and learning. Studies have demonstrated how organisms utilize internal models to anticipate sensory outcomes and minimize prediction errors. However, the application of the FEP to culinary practices remains largely unexplored, presenting a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich literature on culinary arts and the Free Energy Principle, there exists a significant gap in integrating these fields. Most culinary research tends to focus on techniques and flavor profiles in isolation, neglecting the cognitive processes that underpin these practices. Conversely, cognitive science research often overlooks the practical applications of its theories in real-world contexts, such as cooking. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that combines culinary arts with cognitive science, leading to new insights and applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theories

Culinary theories encompass a range of concepts related to flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and the significance of seasonal ingredients. Flavor profiles are shaped by the interplay of taste, aroma, and texture, which are influenced by cultural preferences and ingredient availability. Cooking techniques, whether traditional or modern, reflect not only the physical transformation of ingredients but also the chef's understanding of sensory interactions.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the concepts of free energy minimization, active inference, and predictive coding. Free energy minimization refers to the process by which biological systems strive to reduce the discrepancy between their predictions and sensory experiences. Active inference involves the idea that organisms engage in behaviors that align with their predictions, thereby reducing uncertainty. Predictive coding suggests that the brain continuously generates and updates internal models based on sensory input, allowing for efficient processing of information.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Systems as Adaptive Systems

Understanding culinary practices as adaptive systems involves recognizing cooking as a process of minimizing free energy. Chefs, like biological systems, continuously refine their techniques and flavor profiles in response to sensory feedback and environmental conditions. This perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of cooking and the importance of adaptability in achieving optimal flavor experiences.

#### The Role of Sensory Feedback

Sensory feedback plays a crucial role in refining culinary practices and flavor experiences. Chefs rely on their sensory perceptions to evaluate the outcomes of their cooking techniques, adjusting their methods based on the feedback received. This iterative process of experimentation and refinement mirrors the principles of predictive coding, where sensory input informs and updates internal models.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model combines culinary theories with the Free Energy Principle, illustrating the dynamic interplay between cooking techniques, flavor optimization, and cognitive processes. This model posits that culinary practices can be understood as a series of adaptive responses to sensory feedback, with chefs actively engaging in predictive coding to refine their techniques and enhance flavor experiences.

### Table of Alternative Outcomes

| Culinary Practice | Expected Predictive Outcome | Alternative Outcome | Implications |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Sous-vide Cooking  | Enhanced flavor retention   | Texture compromise   | Need for sensory evaluation |
| Molecular Gastronomy | Novel flavor experiences  | Overly complex dishes | Balancing innovation with tradition |
| Fusion Cuisine      | Unique flavor combinations | Cultural dilution    | Importance of cultural sensitivity |
