## Executive Summary

This dissertation embarks on an exploration of the transformative potential inherent in the integration of patient-centered care principles from healthcare into the domain of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By establishing a robust framework that prioritizes user experience, quality metrics, and technology-driven solutions, this research endeavors to address critical gaps in PME and enhance its relevance and applicability across various domains. The anticipated impact encompasses improved predictive accuracy, heightened user satisfaction, and the establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare and data science. Ultimately, this research aims to redefine the landscape of predictive analytics, fostering a more empathetic and user-oriented approach to predictions.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of healthcare principles with PME signifies a profound paradigm shift. Traditionally, healthcare has focused on patient-centered practices, emphasizing quality, technology integration, and sustainability. The Institute of Medicine (2001) articulates patient-centered care as "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values." This approach has not only enhanced patient outcomes but has also significantly improved satisfaction metrics. Conversely, PME has historically been dominated by data-driven methodologies, often sidelining user experience and emotional insights. This dissertation seeks to bridge these disparate domains, creating a novel approach to predictions that is both user-focused and data-informed.

The integration of healthcare principles into PME can cultivate a more holistic understanding of user needs and experiences. By adopting a patient-centric model, predictive analytics can evolve from being mere statistical outputs to becoming tools that genuinely resonate with and serve users' interests. This shift transcends academic discourse; it holds practical implications for various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and technology, where predictions are pivotal in guiding critical decisions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it reimagines PME through the lens of healthcare principles, providing a framework that enhances predictive capabilities while prioritizing user needs. The novelty lies in the introduction of concepts such as "Patient-Centric Predictions" and "Quality Prediction Metrics," which promise to revolutionize how predictions are made and evaluated. The potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare providers and data scientists could lead to innovative predictive models that are not only technically sound but also empathetic and user-friendly.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of patient-centered care enhance the accuracy and applicability of predictions in PME?
2. What quality metrics can be established to measure the effectiveness of predictive models?
3. How can technology facilitate the integration of user feedback into predictive processes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of healthcare has increasingly shifted towards patient-centered care, a paradigm that emphasizes the importance of understanding and integrating patient experiences into treatment plans. Research has demonstrated that patient-centered practices lead to improved health outcomes and increased patient satisfaction (Bodenheimer & Berry-Millett, 2009). The incorporation of technology in healthcare, such as electronic health records and telemedicine, has further enhanced the ability to provide personalized care, thereby reinforcing the importance of user experience.

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

PME has traditionally relied on data-driven methodologies, focusing on statistical accuracy and algorithmic efficiency. However, these approaches often neglect the qualitative aspects of user experience and emotional insights, leading to a disconnect between predictive outputs and user needs. Cognitive biases—such as confirmation bias and overfitting—can distort the predictive process, resulting in models that fail to resonate with users. This dissertation aims to address these limitations by integrating user-centered approaches into PME.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature highlights a growing recognition of the importance of user experience in both healthcare and predictive analytics. In healthcare, studies emphasize the role of patient engagement and satisfaction in improving health outcomes (Hibbard & Greene, 2013). In PME, there is an increasing acknowledgment of the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches and the necessity for more holistic models that incorporate user feedback.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both fields, significant gaps persist. There remains a lack of user-centered approaches in PME, leading to models that inadequately address the needs and preferences of users. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration, where healthcare principles can inform and enhance predictive modeling practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient-Centered Care Theory

Patient-centered care theory emphasizes the importance of understanding patient needs and experiences. This framework advocates for a healthcare approach that prioritizes the patient's perspective, allowing for more tailored and satisfactory care experiences.

#### Predictive Analytics Theory

Predictive analytics theory focuses on data-driven decision-making processes. It encompasses various statistical and machine learning methodologies aimed at forecasting outcomes based on historical data. However, traditional predictive analytics often lacks the nuance required to address user-specific needs.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Empathy-Driven Prediction Model

The empathy-driven prediction model is a new theoretical construct that integrates emotional insights into predictive modeling. This model recognizes that user emotions and experiences are critical components in shaping predictive outcomes and seeks to incorporate these factors into the predictive process. This model posits that predictions should not merely reflect statistical likelihoods but should also resonate with users on an emotional level.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines patient-centered principles with predictive analytics, fostering a holistic approach to predictions. This model emphasizes the importance of user feedback, quality metrics, and technology integration, creating a comprehensive framework for enhancing PME.
