Current methodologies in studying catalysis, kinetics, and thermodynamics have advanced through the integration of computational chemistry and experimental techniques. Understanding reaction mechanisms at the molecular level has become increasingly sophisticated, allowing for predictive modeling of chemical behavior.

#### Neuroscience

The current understanding of neural circuits, synaptic plasticity, and learning mechanisms has been enriched by advancements in neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques. Research has highlighted the dynamic nature of synapses and the role of neurotransmitters in modulating neural activity. However, the interplay between chemical principles and neural dynamics remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exist significant gaps where cross-disciplinary insights could lead to substantial advancements. The lack of integrative models that encompass both chemical and neural dynamics presents an opportunity for innovative research. By bridging these domains, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of neural function and its implications for health and disease.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Chemical kinetics studies the rates of reactions and the factors influencing these rates, such as concentration, temperature, and catalysts. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, examines the energy changes associated with chemical reactions. Together, these principles provide a framework for understanding how reactions occur and reach equilibrium.

#### Neural Plasticity and Learning Theories

Neural plasticity refers to the ability of neural circuits to adapt and reorganize in response to experience. Established theories, such as Hebbian learning, emphasize the importance of synaptic strengthening through repeated activation. These theories provide a foundation for understanding how learning occurs at the synaptic level.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes a conceptualization of neural processes as analogous to chemical reactions. Neural reactions involve the transformation of inputs into outputs, influenced by the dynamics of neurotransmitter release and receptor activation. This framework allows for the exploration of neural signaling as a series of chemical transformations.

#### Catalytic Neurotransmitter Dynamics

Neurotransmitters are traditionally viewed as signaling molecules, but this research posits that they also function as catalysts in neural signaling. By influencing the efficiency of synaptic transmission, neurotransmitters can alter the dynamics of neural circuits, akin to how catalysts enhance chemical reactions. 

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model integrates chemical reaction dynamics with neural network theories, illustrating the parallels and interactions between the two domains. This model posits that neural circuits operate under principles similar to those governing chemical reactions, including reaction rates, equilibrium, and catalytic processes. By framing neural processes in this way, we can develop a more nuanced understanding of brain function.
