## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The foundations of culinary chemistry can be traced back to early human civilization, where the discovery of fire marked a significant turning point in food preparation. The principles of chemical reactions, such as oxidation and reduction, have been utilized since ancient times, albeit without a formal understanding of the underlying processes. In contrast, the formal study of chemistry began in the 17th century, with pioneers like Robert Boyle and Antoine Lavoisier laying the groundwork for modern chemistry.

The historical evolution of culinary practices has been characterized by a gradual refinement of techniques aimed at enhancing flavor and texture. Traditional cuisines often reflect a deep understanding of ingredient interactions, albeit developed through empirical knowledge rather than scientific inquiry. This historical context underscores the potential for a more systematic exploration of culinary practices through the lens of chemistry.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in chemistry related to food science have opened new avenues for culinary innovation. Molecular gastronomy, a term coined by chefs Ferran Adrià and Hervé This, exemplifies the growing interest in the scientific principles of cooking. This movement emphasizes the exploration of physical and chemical transformations that occur during food preparation, leading to novel textures and flavor combinations.

Current culinary trends increasingly incorporate elements of food science, with chefs employing techniques such as spherification, emulsification, and sous-vide cooking. However, there remains a gap in the systematic application of chemical theories to enhance traditional cooking methods. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of culinary chemistry.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the burgeoning interest in the intersection of chemistry and cuisine, there exists a notable lack of interdisciplinary research bridging these fields. This presents an opportunity to develop new culinary techniques grounded in chemical principles. By identifying and addressing these gaps, this dissertation seeks to contribute to the evolving discourse on culinary innovation and education.

| **Gaps in Current Research** | **Opportunities for Development** |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Limited empirical studies on culinary catalysts | Experimental validation of catalysts in cooking |
| Insufficient theoretical models for flavor equilibrium | Creation of predictive models for flavor balance |
| Lack of integration in culinary education | Development of interdisciplinary curricula |

## Theoretical Framework
