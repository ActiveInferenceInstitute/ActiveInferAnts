## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that adaptive systems, including biological organisms and technological interfaces, strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability in their interactions with the environment. Originally rooted in cognitive science and neuroscience, the FEP suggests that organisms actively engage with their surroundings to reduce uncertainty and optimize their responses. In this context, ATM transactions represent a unique opportunity to apply these principles. The interaction between users and ATMs can be conceptualized as a dynamic system where minimizing free energy translates to optimizing user experience and operational efficiency. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is pioneering in its approach to apply cognitive science principles, specifically the FEP, to financial technology. By introducing the FEP to ATM design, it seeks to bridge the gap between human-computer interaction and financial services, ultimately creating a more effective and user-friendly banking experience. The implications of this research extend beyond ATMs; they encompass a broader spectrum of self-service technologies, suggesting that principles derived from cognitive science can enhance user experience across various sectors. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be systematically applied to enhance ATM transaction efficiency?
2. What role do user expectations and experiences play in the design and functionality of ATMs?
3. How can security measures be reconceptualized to align seamlessly with the FEP framework?
4. In what ways can the integration of AI and machine learning technologies complement the application of FEP in ATM transactions?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle, introduced by neuroscientist Karl Friston, has evolved as a foundational concept in cognitive science, elucidating how living systems maintain homeostasis by minimizing surprise or prediction error. In parallel, the development of ATM technology has transformed banking practices since the introduction of the first ATM in 1967, facilitating immediate access to cash and banking services. This evolution has introduced both challenges and opportunities in user experience and transaction security. 

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing literature on the Free Energy Principle encompasses a range of applications, including perception, action, and decision-making processes. Studies have highlighted how FEP can inform the design of adaptive systems that respond dynamically to user behavior. In the realm of ATM transactions, recent research has focused on user experience, identifying barriers to efficient use and emphasizing the importance of intuitive interface design. However, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these two domains, particularly regarding the practical application of FEP principles in ATM design.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of comprehensive studies that integrate cognitive science principles with financial technology, particularly in the context of ATMs. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring how the FEP can inform ATM design to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. The opportunities for improving user interaction with ATMs are vast, particularly in light of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which can further augment the user experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories from cognitive science related to the FEP include predictive coding and Bayesian inference, which explain how individuals anticipate and respond to environmental stimuli. In financial technology, theories surrounding user experience and interaction design, such as Norman's principles of design and usability heuristics, provide a framework for understanding how users engage with technology. 

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes a theoretical framework that integrates the FEP with ATM transaction processes. By conceptualizing user interactions as a dynamic system of prediction and error correction, this framework aims to identify design elements that can enhance transaction efficiency and user satisfaction. 

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model illustrates the relationship between user interaction, transaction efficiency, and security protocols through the lens of the FEP. It posits that by aligning ATM interfaces with user expectations and predictive behaviors, financial institutions can minimize the variational free energy associated with ATM transactions, leading to improved outcomes for both users and banks.
