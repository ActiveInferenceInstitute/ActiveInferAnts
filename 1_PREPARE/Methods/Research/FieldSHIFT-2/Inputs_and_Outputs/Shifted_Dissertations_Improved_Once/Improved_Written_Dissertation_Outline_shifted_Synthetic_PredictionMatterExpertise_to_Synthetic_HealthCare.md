## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

Prediction Matter Expertise has evolved as an interdisciplinary approach focused on data integration and analytical methods. Its roots can be traced back to fields such as statistics, machine learning, and decision theory, which emphasize the importance of accurate predictions in complex systems. PME has gained traction in various industries, including finance and logistics, where data-driven decision-making is paramount. The principles of PME advocate for the synthesis of diverse data sources to generate actionable insights that inform strategic decisions.

#### Health Care

The historical evolution of patient care models has seen a significant shift towards personalized and integrated care. Traditional health care models often emphasized a one-size-fits-all approach, which failed to account for individual patient needs and preferences. With the advent of technology and data analytics, health care has moved towards a more patient-centered paradigm, where treatment plans are tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient. This shift has been driven by the recognition that improved patient outcomes are closely linked to personalized care strategies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current state of knowledge in PME and health care reveals a growing interest in the application of predictive analytics to enhance patient care. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of predictive modeling in identifying high-risk patients, optimizing resource allocation, and improving clinical outcomes. However, the integration of PME principles into health care remains nascent, with significant opportunities for innovation and improvement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there are notable gaps in the application of PME principles in health care. These include a lack of standardized methodologies for implementing predictive analytics in clinical settings and insufficient collaboration among healthcare professionals from different disciplines. The Shifted Domain presents opportunities for innovation through the integration of predictive analytics and cross-disciplinary collaboration, which can lead to more effective patient management and improved health outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

Key theories in PME include decision-making frameworks that emphasize the importance of data synthesis and analytical rigor. These frameworks provide a structured approach to evaluating complex problems and generating predictions based on empirical evidence. Additionally, data synthesis models highlight the significance of integrating diverse data sources to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

#### Health Care

In health care, theories related to patient-centered care and service quality have gained prominence. These theories underscore the importance of considering patient preferences, values, and needs in the development of treatment plans. The integration of predictive analytics into these frameworks can further enhance the quality of care by enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions that align with patient expectations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of PME and health care has led to the emergence of new theoretical constructs, including Predictive Health Management (PHM) and Adaptive Patient Engagement (APE). PHM focuses on the proactive management of patient health through predictive analytics, while APE emphasizes the importance of real-time feedback and engagement strategies to enhance patient involvement in their care.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between predictive analytics, patient engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration in health care. This model posits that the effective implementation of predictive analytics can enhance patient engagement, leading to improved treatment adherence and satisfaction. Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals can facilitate the successful integration of predictive analytics into clinical practice.
