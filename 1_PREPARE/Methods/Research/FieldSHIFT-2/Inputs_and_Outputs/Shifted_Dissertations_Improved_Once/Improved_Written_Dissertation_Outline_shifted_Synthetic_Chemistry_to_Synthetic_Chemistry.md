## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of chemical reaction theory can be traced back to the early days of chemistry, with foundational contributions from scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier, who formulated the law of conservation of mass, and Dmitri Mendeleev, who developed the periodic table. These early milestones laid the groundwork for understanding chemical transformations, reaction mechanisms, and the principles of kinetics and thermodynamics.

In parallel, the emergence of sustainable chemical practices has gained momentum in recent decades, driven by increasing awareness of environmental issues and the need for resource efficiency. The green chemistry movement, initiated by Paul Anastas and John Warner in the late 1990s, emphasizes the design of chemical products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of sustainable practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in chemical reactions focuses on understanding the mechanisms that govern reaction pathways, the role of catalysts, and the kinetics of reactions. Advances in computational chemistry and molecular modeling have provided deeper insights into reaction dynamics, enabling the design of more efficient and selective processes.

In the realm of sustainable chemistry, current paradigms emphasize the importance of renewable resources, waste reduction, and energy efficiency. The principles of green chemistry advocate for the development of processes that are not only economically viable but also environmentally benign. Research in this area has led to innovative approaches such as biocatalysis, solvent-free reactions, and the use of renewable feedstocks.
