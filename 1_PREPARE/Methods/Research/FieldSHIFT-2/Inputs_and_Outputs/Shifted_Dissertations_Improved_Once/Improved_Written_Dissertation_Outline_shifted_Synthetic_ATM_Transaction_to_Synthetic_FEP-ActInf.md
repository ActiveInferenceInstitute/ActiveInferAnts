## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges the operational aspects of ATM transactions with the theoretical constructs of the Free Energy Principle. The FEP posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept rooted in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. This principle can be applied to understand how ATMs can adapt to user behavior and environmental changes, thereby optimizing their functionality and security. In this context, ATMs are not merely transactional machines but adaptive systems capable of learning from interactions and adjusting their operations accordingly.

This adaptability can be framed within the context of predictive coding, where ATMs continuously update their operational models based on user interactions, thereby enhancing their responsiveness and efficiency. This perspective invites a reconsideration of the role of ATMs in modern banking, positing them as intelligent agents capable of optimizing service delivery in real-time.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between financial technology and cognitive science. By applying the FEP to ATM transactions, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm that enhances user interaction, security measures, and operational efficiency. The implications of this work extend to various stakeholders, including users, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies, suggesting a transformative potential that could redefine how ATMs operate and interact with users.

Moreover, the research contributes to the burgeoning field of adaptive systems, highlighting how principles traditionally associated with biological systems can inform technological advancements. This cross-pollination of ideas not only enriches the understanding of ATM systems but also sets the stage for innovative applications that transcend conventional banking practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This research is guided by the following questions:

- How can the principles of predictive coding enhance ATM interface design?
- What role do dynamic security measures play in minimizing variational free energy in ATM networks?
- How can generative models inform cash management strategies in ATM networks?

The objectives are to explore these questions and develop a comprehensive framework that integrates FEP principles into ATM operations. Additionally, the research aims to formulate testable hypotheses that extend the current understanding of ATM functionalities and their adaptive capabilities.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

**ATM Transactions:** The evolution of ATMs began in the late 1960s, with the introduction of the first cash-dispensing machine. Over the decades, ATMs have evolved from simple cash withdrawal devices to multifunctional platforms offering services such as deposits, transfers, and bill payments. This evolution has significantly impacted banking by providing customers with 24/7 access to financial services, thereby enhancing convenience and operational efficiency. 

**Free Energy Principle:** The FEP, originating from neuroscience, posits that biological systems actively minimize free energy through predictive coding. This principle has broad implications for understanding adaptive systems, suggesting that organisms, including technological systems, continuously update their models of the world to reduce uncertainty and energy expenditure.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

In financial technology, existing research emphasizes user experience and security in ATM transactions. Studies highlight the importance of interface design and user satisfaction, yet there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate cognitive science principles.

In the realm of adaptive systems, the application of FEP has gained traction in various fields, including robotics and artificial intelligence. However, its application to financial technology, particularly ATM transactions, remains underexplored. 

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
