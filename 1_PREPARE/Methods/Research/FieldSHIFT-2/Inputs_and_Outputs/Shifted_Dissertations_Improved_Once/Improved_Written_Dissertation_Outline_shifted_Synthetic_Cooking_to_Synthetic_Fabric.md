## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The culinary arts and fabric design have historically existed as separate disciplines, each characterized by distinct principles, techniques, and cultural significances. However, recent trends toward sustainability and personalization in both fields have prompted a reevaluation of their boundaries. Culinary arts, rooted in sensory experiences, creativity, and cultural expression, can provide a rich source of inspiration for textile design. Conversely, textile design, with its own rich history of cultural significance and tactile experience, can inform culinary presentation and experience. This dissertation proposes a systematic transposition of culinary principles into the fabric industry, creating a novel framework for design and production that transcends traditional boundaries.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize textile design by integrating sensory experiences derived from culinary practices. This novel approach enhances not only the aesthetic and tactile qualities of fabrics but also promotes sustainable practices and cultural diversity. By fostering an interdisciplinary dialogue between culinary arts and textile design, this research aims to uncover new avenues for innovation that can benefit both fields.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Culinary Arts and Textile Design

The culinary arts have evolved from basic survival needs to a sophisticated expression of culture, identity, and creativity. From ancient civilizations that developed unique cooking methods to contemporary chefs who push the boundaries of flavor and presentation, culinary practices reflect societal values and technological advancements. Similarly, textile design has undergone significant transformations, from handwoven fabrics in ancient cultures to the industrial revolution's impact on mass production. Both fields have rich histories that intertwine with societal changes, technological innovations, and cultural exchanges.

#### Historical Interconnections Between Food and Fabric in Various Cultures

Throughout history, food and fabric have often intersected, particularly in cultural rituals, celebrations, and daily life. For example, in many cultures, textiles are adorned with motifs that depict food items or culinary practices, reflecting their importance in social and cultural contexts. The use of textiles in culinary presentations, such as table linens and chef uniforms, further highlights this relationship. Understanding these historical interconnections provides a foundation for exploring contemporary applications of culinary principles in textile design.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Practices in Culinary Arts and Textile Design

Current practices in culinary arts emphasize innovation, sustainability, and experiential dining. Chefs increasingly focus on local sourcing, seasonal ingredients, and creative presentations that engage the senses. In textile design, there is a growing emphasis on sustainable materials, ethical production methods, and innovative design techniques that challenge traditional aesthetics. The convergence of these practices presents opportunities for collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas.

#### Review of Sustainability Efforts and Technological Advancements in Each Domain

Both culinary and textile industries face significant sustainability challenges, including resource depletion, waste generation, and environmental impact. Recent advancements in technology, such as biodegradable materials in textiles and precision agriculture in food production, offer promising solutions. However, there remains a need for a more integrated approach that combines insights from both fields to foster sustainable practices that benefit both industries.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Current Research

Despite the rich histories and contemporary practices of culinary arts and textile design, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that explores their intersections. Existing literature primarily focuses on each field in isolation, neglecting the potential benefits of integrating culinary principles into textile design.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration

The Shifted Domain presents unique opportunities for innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration. By drawing on culinary techniques and principles, textile designers can create fabrics that not only serve functional purposes but also evoke sensory experiences and cultural narratives. This research aims to fill the identified gaps and explore these opportunities, ultimately contributing to the advancement of both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theories Related to Flavor Profiles, Cooking Methods, and Sensory Experiences

Culinary theories emphasize the importance of flavor profiles, which are influenced by various factors such as ingredient combinations, cooking methods, and sensory perceptions. The concept of umami, for example, highlights the complexity of taste and its ability to evoke emotional responses. Understanding these theories provides a basis for exploring how similar principles can be applied to textile design.

#### Textile Theories Concerning Fabric Construction, Design Principles, and Cultural Significance

Textile theories encompass a range of concepts, including fabric construction techniques, design principles, and the cultural significance of textiles. The interplay between texture, color, and pattern in fabric design parallels the relationship between flavor, aroma, and presentation in culinary arts. By examining these theories, this research seeks to establish connections that can inform a new interdisciplinary framework.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of Concepts Such as "Textile Gastronomy" and "Flavor Pairing in Textiles"

This dissertation proposes new theoretical constructs that emerge from the Shifted Domain. "Textile Gastronomy" refers to the exploration of textiles through the lens of culinary principles, emphasizing the sensory experiences and cultural narratives that fabrics can evoke. "Flavor Pairing in Textiles" draws parallels between culinary flavor pairings and textile combinations, suggesting that certain textures, colors, and patterns can be combined to create harmonious and evocative designs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, connecting culinary principles with textile design processes. This model will illustrate how sensory experiences, cultural narratives, and sustainable practices can be interwoven to inform innovative textile design. By establishing clear connections between the two fields, this model aims to provide a framework for future research and practice.
