## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of health care and entomology, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct yet fundamentally interconnected. Health care emphasizes the well-being of human patients, focusing on personalized care, service quality, and technology integration. In contrast, entomology studies insects, emphasizing their ecological roles, behavior, and conservation needs. This dissertation proposes to bridge these domains by applying health care principles to entomological research and practice, thereby establishing a framework that recognizes the intrinsic value of insect populations and their contributions to human health and environmental sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to applying health care frameworks to entomology, creating an interdisciplinary paradigm that prioritizes insect health and ecosystem services. By treating insect populations as "patients," this dissertation aims to develop metrics and methodologies that enhance our understanding of insect behavior and ecological contributions. This paradigm shift has the potential to revolutionize conservation strategies and agricultural practices, making them more sustainable and effective. Furthermore, it opens avenues for innovative research that could lead to the establishment of new sub-disciplines, such as "Health Entomology," which focuses on the health of insect populations and their ecological roles.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles enhance the conservation and management of insect populations?
2. What metrics can be developed to assess the quality of ecosystem services provided by insects?
3. How can technology be utilized to improve our understanding of insect communication and behavior?
4. What interdisciplinary collaborations can be fostered to advance research in this Shifted Domain?
5. How can the integration of health care principles into entomology inform public policy and community engagement strategies?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The historical evolution of health care has seen a paradigm shift from provider-centered to patient-centered approaches. This transformation emphasizes the importance of individual experiences and outcomes, acknowledging that patients are active participants in their care. Similarly, in entomology, the focus has shifted toward understanding biodiversity and the ecological roles of insects, particularly in light of declining populations. This evolution underscores the necessity of adopting holistic approaches that consider the health of both human and non-human entities, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of interdependence within ecosystems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current health care research emphasizes personalized medicine, data-driven decision-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The integration of technology in health care has allowed for improved patient monitoring and tailored treatment plans. In entomology, key research areas include biodiversity conservation, pest management, and the study of insect behavior and physiology. However, there is limited exploration of how principles from health care can inform entomological practices. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research methodologies and conservation strategies that prioritize insect health and ecosystem services.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that connect health care with entomology presents an opportunity to innovate research methodologies and conservation strategies. By developing a comprehensive model that integrates health care principles into entomology, this dissertation aims to address these gaps and promote sustainable practices that benefit both insects and ecosystems. The following table summarizes alternative outcomes based on different interdisciplinary approaches:

| Approach | Potential Outcomes | Implications |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Traditional Entomological Practices | Limited understanding of insect health | Ineffective conservation strategies |
| Health-Centered Entomological Practices | Enhanced insect population health | Improved ecosystem service delivery |
| Interdisciplinary Collaboration | Innovative conservation methodologies | Sustainable agricultural practices and policies |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Health Care:** Patient-centered care, service quality models, and technology integration theories provide the foundational frameworks for understanding how to approach health care principles in an entomological context. These theories emphasize the importance of individual needs and the integration of technology to enhance service delivery.
- **Entomology:** Biodiversity theories, ecological balance, and social behavior theories in insect populations are essential for understanding the ecological roles of insects and their interactions within ecosystems. These theories highlight the complexities of insect populations and their contributions to ecosystem functionality.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Insect-Centered Conservation Theory:** This framework prioritizes the needs and health of insect populations, suggesting that a focus on insect well-being can lead to improved conservation outcomes. This theory posits that just as human patients require tailored care, insect populations benefit from management strategies that consider their unique ecological roles and behaviors.
- **Ecosystem Service Quality Model:** A model for assessing the quality of services provided by insects in ecological contexts, including pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling. This model will allow for the quantification of the relationship between insect health and ecosystem service delivery.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model combining health care principles with entomological practices emphasizes the interdependence of human and insect health within ecosystems. This model will serve as a foundation for developing metrics and methodologies that enhance our understanding of insect populations and their contributions to ecosystem services. The following hypotheses can be formulated based on this integrated model:
1. Hypothesis 1: Implementing insect-centered care principles will lead to measurable improvements in insect population health.
2. Hypothesis 2: Higher quality ecosystem services will correlate with increased biodiversity and resilience of insect populations.
3. Hypothesis 3: Technology-enhanced monitoring will yield more accurate assessments of insect health and behavior.
