## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of culinary arts and traditional knowledge represents a unique opportunity to reimagine how we understand food systems and cultural practices. Culinary arts, with their rich histories and evolving techniques, can inform and revitalize traditional knowledge, which often emphasizes sustainability and ecological harmony. Traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom accumulated over generations, particularly in indigenous communities, regarding the sustainable use of natural resources. Culinary arts, in contrast, are often perceived through the lens of innovation and creativity, yet they are deeply rooted in cultural identity and heritage. This dissertation posits that by transposing culinary concepts into traditional knowledge frameworks, we can facilitate a deeper understanding of food systems that honors both innovation and tradition.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in food production and consumption while preserving cultural heritage. The global food system faces numerous challenges, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, and food insecurity. By merging culinary arts with traditional ecological knowledge, this dissertation will contribute to discussions on biodiversity, food security, and the preservation of indigenous knowledge. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which integrates culinary innovation with the time-tested practices of traditional knowledge, thereby creating a Shifted Domain that fosters sustainability and resilience.

The objectives of this research are to analyze the interplay between culinary arts and traditional knowledge, develop a theoretical model that illustrates their integration, and propose practical applications that can be implemented in communities worldwide.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

A comprehensive examination of the evolution of cuisine and traditional knowledge reveals a rich tapestry of interconnections. Historically, culinary practices have evolved in response to environmental changes, migration patterns, and cultural exchanges. The globalization of food systems has led to the commodification of culinary practices, often at the expense of traditional knowledge. Key historical events, such as colonization and industrialization, have disrupted indigenous food systems and eroded cultural practices. Understanding this historical context is essential for recognizing the value of traditional knowledge in contemporary culinary practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary trends in culinary arts, such as the rise of plant-based diets and sustainable cooking practices, reflect a growing awareness of environmental issues. Similarly, traditional knowledge systems are increasingly recognized for their contributions to holistic health and biodiversity conservation. Indigenous practices often emphasize the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of maintaining ecological balance. However, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that links these two domains, highlighting opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich potential for integration, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research linking culinary arts with traditional ecological practices. This gap presents an opportunity for scholars and practitioners to explore how culinary practices can inform and enhance traditional knowledge systems. By identifying these gaps, this dissertation aims to pave the way for future research that addresses the challenges of food security and cultural preservation.
