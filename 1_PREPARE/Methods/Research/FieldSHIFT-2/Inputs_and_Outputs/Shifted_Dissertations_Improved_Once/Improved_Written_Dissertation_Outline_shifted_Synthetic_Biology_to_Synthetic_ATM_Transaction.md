## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Ecological Theories and Their Foundational Concepts

Ecology, as a discipline, focuses on the relationships between organisms and their environment, emphasizing concepts such as biodiversity, energy flow, and nutrient cycling. Foundational theories such as the Gaia Hypothesis propose that biological and inorganic components of the Earth function as a single self-regulating system. The principles of interconnectedness and resilience have been pivotal in understanding ecosystems' responses to disturbances, highlighting the importance of diversity in promoting stability. These concepts can be utilized to examine the complexities of ATM networks as systems that require a balance of various elements for optimal functionality.

#### Examination of the Evolution of ATM Technology and Transaction Processes

Automated teller machines have evolved significantly since their inception in the late 1960s. Originally designed for basic cash dispensing, ATMs now offer a myriad of services, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. The technological advancements in ATM networks, particularly the integration of digital banking and mobile technology, have transformed user interactions. However, challenges remain in ensuring operational efficiency and user satisfaction, particularly in the face of increasing transaction volumes and user expectations for seamless service.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Existing Literature on Ecosystem Dynamics and Their Applications in Various Industries

Research has demonstrated the applicability of ecological principles across various sectors, including urban planning, agriculture, and healthcare. The concept of resilience, for example, has been utilized to enhance the adaptability of urban infrastructures in response to climate change. However, the banking sector remains largely unexamined in this context, presenting a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research. By exploring how ecological dynamics influence user behavior and service delivery, this dissertation aims to fill this gap.

#### Analysis of Contemporary Research on ATM Transactions

Recent studies have focused on user experience, security, and operational efficiency in ATM transactions. However, these studies often adopt a siloed approach, neglecting the potential insights from ecological frameworks. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by applying ecosystem concepts to ATM networks, thereby enhancing understanding of user behavior and transaction dynamics. 

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research Linking Ecology and Banking Technology

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both ecology and banking technology, there exists a notable paucity of interdisciplinary research that integrates these domains. This gap presents a significant opportunity for innovation, as the application of ecological principles could lead to transformative changes in ATM operations.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Enhancing ATM Networks Through Ecosystem Principles

By adopting an ecosystem perspective, banking institutions can explore new strategies for improving ATM functionality, user engagement, and service reliability. The potential for enhanced user experiences through the integration of ecological concepts is vast, offering a fresh approach to addressing longstanding challenges in the banking sector.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Ecological Theories: Systems Theory, Resilience Theory, and Biodiversity Theory

Systems theory posits that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, emphasizing the interdependence of components within a system. Resilience theory focuses on the capacity of a system to absorb disturbances while maintaining its core functions, and biodiversity theory underscores the importance of diverse elements in promoting system stability and adaptability. These theories provide a robust foundation for understanding ATM networks as complex adaptive systems that require careful management of their components to thrive.

#### Banking Theories Related to Transaction Processing and User Experience

Banking theories, including transaction cost economics and service quality models, emphasize the importance of efficiency and user satisfaction in financial transactions. These theories can be enriched by ecological concepts, leading to a more holistic understanding of ATM operations. For instance, integrating user feedback into service design can enhance satisfaction and loyalty, much like how biodiversity contributes to ecosystem resilience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes an integrated model that synthesizes ecological principles with banking operations. The model highlights the interactions between ATM features, user behavior, and ecological dynamics, providing a framework for analyzing and improving ATM networks. This model serves as a guide for understanding how various components interact to influence overall system performance.

#### Introduction of New Constructs: "Transaction Biodiversity" and "Cash Flow Ecosystem"

The concept of "transaction biodiversity" refers to the variety of transaction types available to users, while the "cash flow ecosystem" encompasses the dynamic interactions between cash availability, user demand, and operational efficiency. These constructs will be pivotal in guiding the research and analysis throughout this dissertation. The introduction of these constructs allows for a more nuanced examination of how diversity and flow impact user engagement and satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A diagrammatic representation of the integrated model will illustrate the interactions between ATM features, user behavior, and ecological principles, serving as a visual guide for the subsequent analysis and discussions.
