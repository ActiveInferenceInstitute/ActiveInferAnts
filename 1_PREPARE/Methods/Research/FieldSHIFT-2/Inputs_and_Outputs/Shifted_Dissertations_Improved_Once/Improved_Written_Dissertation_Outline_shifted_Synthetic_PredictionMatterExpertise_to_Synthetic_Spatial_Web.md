## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)
The evolution of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) can be traced back to the emergence of interdisciplinary research in the late 20th century. PME synthesizes knowledge from diverse fields such as statistics, computer science, and domain-specific expertise to create predictive models that inform decision-making. Key methodologies that have shaped PME include Bayesian inference, machine learning algorithms, and simulation modeling. The interdisciplinary nature of PME allows for the integration of qualitative insights with quantitative data, enhancing the predictive accuracy and relevance of outcomes.

#### Spatial Web
The concept of the Spatial Web has evolved alongside advancements in technology, particularly with the advent of the Internet and mobile computing. Initially conceptualized as a means of enhancing user interactions with digital content, the Spatial Web has grown to encompass a wide range of technologies, including AR, VR, and IoT. Key milestones in the development of the Spatial Web include the introduction of location-based services, the proliferation of smart devices, and the development of immersive environments. As the Spatial Web continues to evolve, challenges such as data overload, user privacy, and interoperability remain pressing concerns.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)
The current landscape of PME is characterized by its application in various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and marketing. Predictive analytics has become an essential tool for organizations seeking to enhance decision-making processes and optimize outcomes. However, there remains a gap in the application of PME principles to emerging technologies such as the Spatial Web, where the potential for real-time data integration and analysis could significantly enhance user experiences.

#### Spatial Web
In the Spatial Web, prevailing technologies such as AR and VR are being utilized to create immersive user experiences. However, issues related to user engagement, data interoperability, and the integration of physical and digital environments persist. Current strategies for user engagement often rely on static content delivery rather than dynamic, predictive interactions that could enhance user experiences. By integrating PME principles, the Spatial Web can evolve to offer more personalized and context-aware interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals several gaps where PME principles have not been fully applied to the Spatial Web, particularly in the realms of predictive analytics and user experience design. Opportunities for innovation arise from the potential to develop frameworks that leverage predictive modeling to enhance user interactions, improve system responsiveness, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates PME into the Spatial Web.
