## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of ATM technology has significantly impacted banking practices since the introduction of the first ATM in the late 1960s. Initially designed to automate cash withdrawals, ATMs have expanded their functionality, allowing users to conduct a variety of transactions without human intervention. This transformation has paved the way for the development of digital banking models that further emphasize self-service and convenience. 

Digital banking emerged in response to the need for more efficient and accessible banking solutions, leveraging the internet and mobile technologies to offer services that were once confined to physical branches. The historical context underscores the importance of understanding both ATM and digital banking evolution as a foundation for innovative integration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research on ATM transactions highlights several key areas, including transaction efficiency, security measures, and user experience. Studies have shown that ATMs can significantly reduce transaction times compared to traditional banking methods, and their security features have evolved to mitigate risks associated with fraud and theft. In the realm of digital banking, trends indicate a growing focus on user experience, with institutions investing in user-friendly interfaces and personalized services. 

However, barriers to entry, such as lack of digital literacy and access to technology, continue to hinder financial inclusion for certain populations. The literature reveals a need for comprehensive frameworks that incorporate ATM principles into digital banking to address these barriers effectively.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both ATM technology and digital banking, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding the integration of ATM principles into digital banking platforms. This research seeks to fill this gap by exploring the opportunities for innovation in financial services through interdisciplinary research. By examining the intersection of ATM transaction concepts and digital banking practices, this dissertation aims to uncover new insights that can inform the design and implementation of user-centric financial services.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical framework for this dissertation is grounded in two foundational theories: self-service technology theory and security and trust frameworks in financial transactions. 

- **Self-Service Technology Theory:** This theory posits that consumers prefer services that allow them autonomy and control over their transactions. This preference is particularly relevant in the context of digital banking, where users seek to manage their finances independently.
  
- **Security and Trust Frameworks:** These frameworks emphasize the importance of perceived security in fostering user trust, which is critical for the adoption of digital banking services.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From the transposition of ATM principles into digital banking, two new theoretical constructs emerge: 

- **Digital Self-Service Banking (DSSB) Framework:** This framework encapsulates the principles of self-service, convenience, and user empowerment in digital banking. 
- **Secure Transaction Protocols (STP) Model:** This model focuses on the security measures necessary to build trust in digital transactions.

Together, these constructs provide a comprehensive understanding of how ATM principles can inform the design of digital banking platforms.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes ATM transaction principles with digital banking paradigms. The model highlights the interplay between self-service, security, efficiency, and accessibility, illustrating how these elements can be harmonized to create a superior digital banking experience. By integrating insights from both domains, the model serves as a foundation for further research and practical applications in the financial services industry.
