## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The fabric industry has undergone significant evolution over centuries, transitioning from traditional craftsmanship to contemporary textile technologies. Historical practices, such as hand-weaving and dyeing, reflect cultural narratives and local identities. The advent of industrialization brought about mass production, which, while increasing accessibility, often compromised craftsmanship and sustainability. Concurrently, the Spatial Web has emerged as a transformative digital landscape, characterized by advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and immersive technologies. Understanding the historical context of both domains is essential for identifying opportunities for integration and innovation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals key trends in textile design, sustainability practices, and the Spatial Web. In textile design, there is a growing emphasis on sustainable materials and practices, such as upcycling and eco-friendly dyes. Concurrently, the Spatial Web is witnessing innovations in user experience design, emphasizing interactivity and immersion. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary studies that combine these fields, highlighting the need for research that explores the synergies between textile arts and digital experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in existing research underscores the potential for this dissertation to contribute to both fields. Notably, the absence of interdisciplinary studies that fuse textile arts with digital experiences presents an opportunity for innovation. By addressing this gap, the dissertation aims to enrich the discourse surrounding user engagement, sustainability, and cultural representation in the Spatial Web.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories from the fabric industry, such as design theory and sustainability frameworks, provide a foundation for this research. Design theory emphasizes the importance of aesthetics, functionality, and user experience in textile design. Sustainability frameworks, on the other hand, focus on minimizing environmental impact and promoting ethical practices. In the Spatial Web, theories related to user experience design and immersive technology are paramount. These theories inform the development of digital experiences that prioritize user engagement and emotional connection.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of textile design principles and the Spatial Web gives rise to new theoretical constructs. One such construct is the "Textile-Driven Spatial Experience," which posits that the application of textile aesthetics and principles can enhance user engagement and emotional resonance in digital environments. This construct serves as a guiding framework for the dissertation, informing the research questions and objectives.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the relationships between textile design principles, user engagement, and sustainability in digital environments. This model will serve as a conceptual framework for analyzing how the integration of these domains can lead to innovative and sustainable digital experiences.
