## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The confluence of chemistry and probabilistic programming signifies a groundbreaking transformation in the modeling of complex systems. Chemistry, characterized by its emphasis on interactions and transformations, aligns seamlessly with the core tenets of probabilistic programming, which focuses on updating beliefs in uncertain environments. Traditional chemistry elucidates the behavior of molecules through well-defined principles such as reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, which delineate how substances interact and change. Conversely, probabilistic programming facilitates the modeling of uncertainty and the refinement of predictions based on new data. This intersection offers a unique opportunity to cultivate a more nuanced understanding of inference processes by applying chemical principles within probabilistic frameworks.

By conceptualizing inference processes as chemical reactions, we enable a deeper exploration of model dynamics. The novelty of this work lies in the systematic application of chemical concepts, such as reaction rates and equilibrium states, to enhance Bayesian inference methodologies. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also bears practical implications for improving the accuracy and interpretability of models utilized across various domains.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemistry

The evolution of chemistry from alchemy to modern science is marked by pivotal milestones, including the establishment of the periodic table and the formulation of atomic theory. Alchemy, with its mystical and philosophical underpinnings, laid the groundwork for the systematic study of matter. The transition to modern chemistry occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, propelled by the contributions of scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier, who articulated the law of conservation of mass, and Dmitri Mendeleev, who devised the periodic table. These advancements provided a robust framework for understanding chemical reactions and the behavior of substances, fostering the development of contemporary chemical theory.

#### RxInfer.jl

RxInfer.jl is a sophisticated probabilistic programming library designed to facilitate Bayesian inference. The genesis of probabilistic programming can be traced back to the need for modeling complex systems under uncertainty. Early frameworks such as BUGS and JAGS paved the way for more advanced libraries like RxInfer.jl, which leverage modern computational capabilities to enhance scalability and efficiency in Bayesian modeling. Nonetheless, challenges persist in areas such as model interpretability and the development of algorithms capable of handling large datasets effectively.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemistry

Recent advancements in chemistry, particularly in green chemistry and computational methods, have revolutionized the approach to chemical processes. Green chemistry emphasizes sustainable practices and the minimization of hazardous substances, while computational chemistry employs algorithms and simulations to predict chemical behavior. These developments have opened new avenues for research and application, particularly in materials science and pharmaceuticals.

#### RxInfer.jl

Current research in RxInfer.jl is concentrated on addressing challenges related to scalability, model interpretability, and the necessity for improved algorithms. Despite its capabilities, there exists a gap in the integration of domain-specific knowledge, such as that from chemistry, which could enhance the modeling process. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by proposing the Chemical Inference Models framework.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a conspicuous absence of interdisciplinary approaches that amalgamate chemical principles with probabilistic programming. This research endeavors to fill this gap by proposing a new framework that enhances both fields. By integrating concepts from chemistry into RxInfer.jl, we can develop models that are not only more accurate but also provide greater insights into the underlying processes governing inference.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Thermodynamics and Kinetics

Thermodynamics and kinetics are foundational principles in chemistry governing chemical reactions. Thermodynamics emphasizes the energy changes associated with chemical processes, while kinetics examines the rates at which reactions occur. These principles can be applied to understand how inference processes converge and how external factors influence model performance.

#### Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a statistical method that updates beliefs based on observed data. It is characterized by the use of prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior distributions. The ability to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs in light of new evidence renders Bayesian inference a powerful tool for modeling uncertainty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The emergence of "Chemical Inference Models" (CIM) redefines our understanding of inference processes through the lens of chemical dynamics. By conceptualizing inference as a series of chemical reactions, we can draw parallels between the behavior of molecules and the updating of beliefs in probabilistic models. This novel theoretical construct provides a framework for exploring the dynamics of inference in a more nuanced manner.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model incorporates reaction dynamics, catalytic influences, and equilibrium states into the framework of Bayesian inference. This model posits that inference processes can be understood as a series of reactions, with parameters analogous to reaction rates and equilibrium constants. By applying these concepts, we can develop more robust and interpretable models that enhance our understanding of complex systems.
