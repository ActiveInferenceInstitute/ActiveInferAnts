# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges at the confluence of two distinct yet complementary fields—ATM transactions and blockchain technology. Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have long served as a vital interface between users and banking services, facilitating cash withdrawals, deposits, and account inquiries with remarkable efficiency. The design and functionality of ATMs prioritize user experience, offering intuitive interfaces and robust security measures that foster user trust and satisfaction. In contrast, blockchain technology represents a decentralized framework for secure transactions, characterized by transparency, immutability, and a robust resistance to fraud. 

This intersection presents a unique opportunity to enhance financial services through innovative applications that prioritize user experience and security. By leveraging the strengths of both domains, this research aims to synthesize the user-friendly, familiar aspects of ATM interactions with the advanced security and transparency features of blockchain. Such a synthesis can lead to the development of financial applications that not only meet the demands of tech-savvy users but also cater to those who may feel intimidated by traditional blockchain interfaces.
