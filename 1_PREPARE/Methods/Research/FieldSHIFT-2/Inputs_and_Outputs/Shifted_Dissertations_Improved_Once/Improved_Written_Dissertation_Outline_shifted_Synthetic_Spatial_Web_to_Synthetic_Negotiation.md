## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Spatial Web:** The evolution of the Spatial Web can be traced back to the inception of the internet, transitioning from static web pages to interactive and immersive experiences that have fundamentally altered user engagement with digital content. Technologies such as AR and VR have emerged as pivotal tools in this evolution, providing users with enriched experiences that amalgamate physical and digital realms.

- **Negotiation:** The historical development of negotiation theories underscores the importance of interpersonal skills, cultural awareness, and strategic communication. From Fisher and Uryâ€™s principled negotiation approach to contemporary integrative negotiation strategies, the field has evolved to encompass diverse frameworks aimed at improving negotiation outcomes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- The current landscape of the Spatial Web is characterized by a proliferation of AR and VR applications across various sectors, including education, healthcare, and entertainment. These technologies have demonstrated their potential to enhance user engagement, facilitate complex interactions, and provide immersive experiences that redefine traditional paradigms.

- Negotiation strategies today grapple with challenges such as globalization, technological disruptions, and evolving stakeholder expectations. The existing literature emphasizes the necessity for adaptive strategies that embrace technological advancements to surmount these challenges.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements in both fields, a significant gap persists in the integration of technological innovations into negotiation practices. The absence of comprehensive frameworks that leverage real-time data, immersive experiences, and decentralized trust mechanisms presents a unique opportunity for research aimed at enhancing negotiation outcomes. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by proposing a systematic integration of Spatial Web technologies into negotiation practices.

## Theoretical Framework
