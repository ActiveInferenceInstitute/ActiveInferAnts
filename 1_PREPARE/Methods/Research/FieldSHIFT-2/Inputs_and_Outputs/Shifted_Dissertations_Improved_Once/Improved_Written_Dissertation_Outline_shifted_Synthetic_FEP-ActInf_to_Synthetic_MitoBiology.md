## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity and functionality. This principle has gained traction in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and theoretical biology, suggesting that living organisms continuously strive to reduce the discrepancy between their predictions of sensory inputs and the actual inputs they receive. Mitochondria, as the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role in energy production and metabolism, generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This dissertation explores the potential of integrating these two domains, suggesting that mitochondria may operate under principles akin to those guiding cognitive processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges cognitive neuroscience and cellular biology, providing a fresh perspective on mitochondrial function. By applying concepts from FEP to mitochondrial dynamics, this study aims to reveal underlying mechanisms of energy management that could lead to advancements in understanding metabolic disorders and developing new therapeutic approaches. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, which has been largely unexplored in existing literature, thus opening new avenues for research into mitochondrial behavior and its implications for health and disease. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by several key research questions and objectives:

- **How can the principles of predictive coding and active inference be applied to mitochondrial function?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle was first articulated by Karl Friston in the early 2000s, positing that biological systems are fundamentally predictive in nature. This principle has profound implications for understanding adaptive behavior, suggesting that organisms minimize surprise by continuously updating their internal models of the world based on sensory input. The FEP has since been applied to various domains, including perception, action, and learning, providing a unifying framework for understanding complex biological phenomena.

#### Mitochondrial Function

Mitochondrial research has evolved significantly since the discovery of mitochondria as cellular organelles in the late 19th century. Initially viewed solely as energy producers, mitochondria are now recognized for their multifaceted roles in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and signaling. Key discoveries, such as the elucidation of the electron transport chain and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in diseases like diabetes and neurodegeneration, have underscored the importance of understanding mitochondrial dynamics in health and disease.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in the Free Energy Principle have expanded its applicability beyond cognitive neuroscience, with researchers exploring its implications for biological systems at various scales. In parallel, contemporary research on mitochondrial dynamics has focused on the intricacies of mitochondrial biogenesis, fission, and fusion, as well as their roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate cognitive theories with mitochondrial research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive theories and mitochondrial research presents a unique opportunity to explore how principles of predictive coding and active inference can elucidate mitochondrial behavior. This gap in the literature highlights the potential for novel research directions that could lead to groundbreaking therapeutic innovations for mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding posits that organisms generate predictions about incoming sensory information and update these predictions based on discrepancies between expected and actual inputs. This process involves a hierarchical organization of neural systems, where higher-order areas generate predictions that are refined by lower-order sensory inputs. The implications of predictive coding extend beyond perception, suggesting that all biological systems, including mitochondria, may engage in predictive processing to optimize their functions.

#### Active Inference

Active inference builds upon the concept of predictive coding, positing that biological systems not only update their internal models but also take actions to minimize prediction errors. This framework emphasizes the role of agency in biological systems, suggesting that organisms actively shape their environments to align with their predictions. In the context of mitochondrial function, active inference may provide insights into how mitochondria adapt to changing cellular demands.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Mitochondrial Predictive Coding

This construct conceptualizes how mitochondria may utilize internal models to predict ATP demands based on cellular activity. By anticipating energy needs, mitochondria could optimize their metabolic responses, enhancing efficiency and maintaining cellular homeostasis. This section will explore the potential mechanisms that underpin this predictive capacity, such as mitochondrial calcium signaling and the integration of metabolic cues.

#### Energetic Active Inference

Energetic active inference offers a framework for understanding mitochondrial responses to cellular demands. This construct posits that mitochondria actively adjust their dynamics—such as fission and fusion—in response to predicted energy requirements, thereby maintaining energy balance and cellular health. Investigating these dynamics will reveal the extent to which mitochondria engage in active inference processes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes the principles of the Free Energy Principle with mitochondrial function, outlining the interactions between predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy. This model posits that mitochondria function as predictive agents, continuously adjusting their energy production in response to cellular demands, thereby minimizing variational free energy and optimizing metabolic efficiency.
