### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has emerged as a response to the pervasive challenges posed by digital misinformation, particularly in the context of social media and online communication. The rise of "fake news" and the manipulation of information have prompted a need for frameworks that protect cognitive processes from exploitation. Cognitive security encompasses strategies aimed at enhancing individuals' abilities to critically evaluate information, recognize cognitive biases, and develop resilience against misinformation. This field draws from psychology, information science, and security studies, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the challenges it seeks to address.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### ATM Transactions

The current state of knowledge in ATM transactions is characterized by established best practices in user interface design, transaction security, and interoperability. Research has demonstrated the importance of intuitive design in enhancing user satisfaction and reducing errors during transactions. Furthermore, security protocols, such as two-factor authentication and encryption, have been extensively studied to ensure the integrity of financial transactions.

### Cognitive Security

In cognitive security, a growing body of research has emerged on misinformation, cognitive biases, and the psychological aspects of information processing. Studies have highlighted the impact of cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and the Dunning-Kruger effect, on individuals' ability to critically evaluate information. Additionally, research has explored the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at improving information literacy and promoting critical thinking skills among users.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in frameworks that integrate transactional principles into cognitive security. Current cognitive security tools often lack user-friendly designs that facilitate information verification and enhance public resilience against misinformation. By leveraging the established principles of ATM transactions, this dissertation aims to address these gaps, proposing a framework that promotes user engagement and trust in cognitive security practices.
