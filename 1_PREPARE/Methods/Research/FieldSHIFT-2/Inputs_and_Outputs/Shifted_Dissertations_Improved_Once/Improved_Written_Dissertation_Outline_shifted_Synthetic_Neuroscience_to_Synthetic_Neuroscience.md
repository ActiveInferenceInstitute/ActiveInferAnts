## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of biological neural networks and artificial neural networks represents a novel research domain that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Biological neural networks, comprised of intricately interconnected neurons that communicate through synapses, provide a rich source of inspiration for designing computational models. Understanding the mechanisms by which biological systems learn and adapt can inform the development of more sophisticated artificial systems. The human brain, with its approximately 86 billion neurons and trillions of synapses, exhibits remarkable capabilities in learning, memory, and problem-solving. This complexity serves as a blueprint for developing ANNs that can mimic these processes, posing salient questions about the nature of intelligence itself.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it seeks to address the limitations of current ANNs, such as overfitting and lack of interpretability. Traditional ANN architectures often struggle with generalization, leading to suboptimal performance when faced with unseen data. By drawing from biological principles, we can create adaptive learning algorithms and diverse neuron models that enhance performance. This novel approach could revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, making it more aligned with human cognitive processes. Furthermore, the integration of biological concepts into AI systems fosters a deeper understanding of both fields, potentially leading to breakthroughs in cognitive computing and neuroscience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can glial-inspired support structures enhance the stability and efficiency of neural computations?

The objectives of this research are to develop and validate novel ANN architectures that incorporate biologically inspired mechanisms, thereby improving learning efficiency, adaptability, and interpretability.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Neural Networks

Biological neural networks consist of neurons interconnected through synapses, forming complex networks that facilitate communication and information processing. Neurons can be classified based on their structure and function, including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. The learning mechanisms in biological systems are largely attributed to synaptic plasticity, which encompasses long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). These mechanisms allow for the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections based on the activity of the neurons involved, raising intriguing questions about the nature of memory and learning.

#### Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks

The evolution of artificial neural networks has been marked by several key milestones, beginning with the perceptron model in the 1950s. Over the decades, ANNs have evolved into more sophisticated architectures, including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Despite their successes, current ANNs face challenges such as overfitting, lack of interpretability, and limited generalization capabilities, necessitating innovative approaches that draw inspiration from biological systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Research on Synaptic Plasticity

Research on synaptic plasticity has revealed critical insights into how biological systems learn and adapt. LTP, characterized by the strengthening of synapses following high-frequency stimulation, is thought to underlie learning and memory processes. Conversely, LTD involves the weakening of synaptic connections and plays a role in forgetting and information pruning. Understanding these mechanisms can inform the development of learning algorithms that mirror biological processes, enhancing the adaptability of ANNs. This raises the question: how can we quantitatively model these biological processes in computational terms?

#### Analysis of Current Challenges in ANNs

Current challenges in ANNs include issues related to interpretability, where the decision-making processes of neural networks remain opaque. Additionally, overfitting—where models perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data—continues to hinder the effectiveness of ANNs. These challenges underscore the need for innovative approaches that incorporate biological principles to improve the robustness and interpretability of artificial systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advances in both biological and artificial neural networks, there remains a significant gap in the integration of biological principles into computational models. This gap presents opportunities for innovative research that could lead to breakthroughs in AI. By systematically incorporating concepts such as synaptic plasticity, neuron diversity, and glial support into ANN architectures, we can develop models that are not only more efficient but also better aligned with human cognitive processes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neural Plasticity Theories

Neural plasticity theories, particularly those related to LTP and LTD, provide a foundational understanding of learning mechanisms in biological systems. LTP is characterized by a persistent increase in synaptic strength following repeated stimulation, while LTD involves a long-lasting decrease in synaptic efficacy. These processes are crucial for memory formation and learning, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be employed in the training of ANNs to enhance their adaptability and learning capabilities. This leads to the hypothesis that "Integrating LTP and LTD into ANN training will significantly improve model adaptability and generalization."

#### Theories of Neuron Diversity

Theories of neuron diversity highlight the importance of different neuron types in information processing. Various neuron types exhibit distinct properties, such as firing rates, response patterns, and connectivity, which contribute to the overall functionality of neural circuits. Incorporating diverse neuron models into ANNs could enhance their capacity to process complex information and improve their performance on a range of tasks. This raises the question: "How can the diversity of neuron types in biological systems inform the design of ANN architectures?"

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes a framework that links biological learning mechanisms to computational models, emphasizing the integration of synaptic plasticity, neuron diversity, and glial support. This framework serves as a foundation for developing biologically inspired algorithms that can be implemented in ANNs, thereby enhancing their learning efficiency and adaptability. 

#### Introduction of New Constructs

New constructs such as neuroplasticity algorithms and dynamic activation functions are introduced in this dissertation. Neuroplasticity algorithms aim to mimic the adaptive learning processes observed in biological systems, while dynamic activation functions adjust their behavior based on input patterns, similar to how neurotransmitter dynamics influence neuronal firing. This prompts the hypothesis: "Dynamic activation functions will lead to improved performance in complex tasks compared to static activation functions."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a comprehensive model that combines biological principles with computational strategies. The model illustrates how synaptic plasticity, neuron diversity, and glial support interact to enhance learning in ANNs. By integrating these elements, we can develop AI systems that are more adaptive, efficient, and capable of tackling complex challenges.
