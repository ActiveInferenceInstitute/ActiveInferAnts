## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Science

Ecosystem science has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 20th century. Early ecologists, such as Eugene Odum, laid the groundwork for understanding ecosystems as complex networks of interactions among organisms and their environments. Key principles, including energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species interdependence, have been foundational to ecological research. The concept of resilience, introduced by Holling (1973), highlights the ability of ecosystems to absorb disturbances while maintaining their essential functions.

Recent advancements in ecosystem science, such as the incorporation of complexity theory, further elucidate the intricate relationships within ecosystems. This perspective emphasizes that ecosystems are not merely collections of organisms but are dynamic entities characterized by emergent properties that arise from the interactions among their components.

#### Hospitality Management

The field of hospitality management has similarly undergone transformations, particularly in its approach to guest experience. The evolution of service quality metrics, from early models focused solely on tangible aspects of service to contemporary frameworks that emphasize experiential and emotional dimensions, reflects a growing recognition of the complexity of guest interactions. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), remains a cornerstone in understanding service quality, yet it often fails to account for the dynamic nature of guest experiences.

Recent studies highlight the importance of emotional intelligence and staff engagement in shaping guest satisfaction, indicating a shift towards recognizing the human element in hospitality operations. This evolution underscores the need for a more integrated approach that considers both ecological and human factors in enhancing service delivery.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in ecosystem dynamics emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and interconnectedness in maintaining ecosystem health. In hospitality management, studies increasingly focus on the role of service quality, employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. However, interdisciplinary studies linking ecology and service industries remain limited, highlighting a significant gap in the literature.

Furthermore, the emergence of concepts such as "service ecosystems" and "experience co-creation" in hospitality research suggests a growing recognition of the need to understand service delivery through an ecological lens. These concepts align with ecosystem principles, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and shared value creation in enhancing guest experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of ecological theories into hospitality practices presents a unique opportunity to address existing gaps in both fields. By exploring the interconnectedness of various service components and the role of biodiversity in enhancing guest experiences, this research aims to fill a critical void in hospitality scholarship. Furthermore, the application of resilience theory can offer insights into how hospitality businesses can adapt to changing market conditions and guest expectations.

The Shifted Domain provides a framework for examining the interplay between ecological principles and hospitality management practices, opening avenues for innovative research and practical applications. By leveraging insights from ecosystem science, hospitality managers can develop strategies that prioritize sustainability, adaptability, and interconnectedness, ultimately enhancing the overall guest experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theory

Ecosystem theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of various components within an ecosystem, including biotic (living organisms) and abiotic (physical environment) factors. Key concepts such as energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species diversity provide a lens through which to examine hospitality operations. The resilience of ecosystems is determined by their ability to adapt to disturbances, a principle that can be applied to hospitality management to enhance operational effectiveness.

#### Service Quality Theory

Service quality theory, particularly the SERVQUAL model, identifies key dimensions of service quality, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions are crucial for understanding guest satisfaction and loyalty. By integrating ecosystem principles, hospitality managers can develop a more nuanced understanding of how these dimensions interact within the context of a dynamic service environment.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
