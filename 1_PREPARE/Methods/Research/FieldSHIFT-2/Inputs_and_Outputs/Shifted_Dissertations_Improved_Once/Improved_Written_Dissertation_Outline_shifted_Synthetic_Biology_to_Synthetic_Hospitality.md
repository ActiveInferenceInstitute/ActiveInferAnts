## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges ecosystem principles—such as interconnectedness and resilience—with hospitality management, focusing on guest experience. This interdisciplinary approach recognizes that hospitality operations can be viewed as dynamic ecosystems, where various components interact to create holistic guest experiences. In essence, the hospitality environment is akin to a natural ecosystem where various elements—including staff, guests, and operational processes—interact to produce unique outcomes. 

The application of ecological principles to hospitality management allows for a deeper understanding of these interactions, emphasizing the importance of relationships and the flow of resources in enhancing service quality. For instance, how do staff interactions influence the guest experience? What role does the physical environment play in shaping these interactions? These questions underscore the necessity of a systems-thinking approach in hospitality management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to redefine hospitality management practices by applying ecological theories to enhance operational effectiveness and guest satisfaction. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecological concepts to address contemporary challenges in hospitality, such as service quality and sustainability. By framing hospitality management within an ecological context, this dissertation aims to offer fresh insights into the complexities of guest interactions and operational dynamics. 

Furthermore, the research aims to contribute to the academic discourse on sustainability in hospitality, providing a robust theoretical foundation for future studies and practical applications. It is anticipated that this work will catalyze a paradigm shift in how hospitality organizations conceptualize their operations, leading to more sustainable and guest-centric practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Science

Ecosystem science has evolved significantly since its inception, with foundational principles established in the mid-20th century. Early ecologists focused on understanding the relationships between organisms and their environments, leading to the development of key concepts such as biodiversity, energy flow, and ecological succession. Over time, the field has expanded to include complex systems theory, emphasizing the interconnectedness of ecological components and the importance of resilience in maintaining ecosystem health.

The concept of **ecosystem services**—the benefits humans derive from ecosystems—has also gained traction, suggesting that hospitality can capitalize on natural resources while contributing to their preservation. This perspective invites hospitality managers to consider how their practices can enhance or diminish these services, thereby affecting both guest experiences and environmental sustainability.

#### Hospitality Management

The evolution of hospitality management has been marked by a shift from traditional service models to more customer-centric approaches. Early paradigms focused primarily on operational efficiency and standardization, while contemporary frameworks emphasize the importance of guest experience, personalization, and service quality metrics. 

The integration of technology and the rise of social media have further transformed the landscape, necessitating a more nuanced understanding of guest interactions and expectations. As guests increasingly seek unique experiences, the hospitality industry must adapt by leveraging innovative service delivery models that reflect the principles of interconnectedness and resilience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in ecosystem dynamics highlights the importance of biodiversity and resilience in sustaining ecological systems. In parallel, hospitality service management literature has increasingly recognized the value of personalized service and guest engagement. However, there remains a scarcity of interdisciplinary studies that effectively bridge these two domains, limiting the potential for innovative applications of ecological principles in hospitality settings.

| Field                     | Key Concepts                  | Research Gaps                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Ecosystem Science         | Biodiversity, Resilience      | Application in service industries     |
| Hospitality Management     | Guest Experience, Personalization | Integration of ecological principles   |

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identified gap in the literature underscores the need for a comprehensive framework that integrates ecological theories with hospitality practices. This dissertation seeks to explore opportunities for enhancing guest experience through ecological insights, particularly in the areas of interconnectedness, service diversity, and feedback mechanisms. By addressing these gaps, the research aims to contribute to both hospitality management and ecosystem science, fostering a more holistic understanding of service delivery.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theory

Ecosystem theory posits that all components of an ecosystem—biotic and abiotic—are interdependent and contribute to the overall health of the system. Key concepts include:

- **Interconnectedness:** The relationships between different species and their environments, which influence resource availability and ecosystem stability.
- **Biodiversity:** The variety of life forms within an ecosystem, which contributes to resilience and adaptability.
- **Energy Flow:** The transfer of energy through food webs, highlighting the importance of producers, consumers, and decomposers.
- **Resilience:** The capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change.

These concepts can be directly applied to hospitality settings, where the interplay between staff roles, guest interactions, and operational processes can be understood through an ecological lens.

#### Service Quality Theory

Service quality theory focuses on the dimensions of service delivery that contribute to guest satisfaction. Key dimensions include:

- **Tangibles:** The physical appearance of facilities and equipment.
- **Reliability:** The ability to perform promised services dependably and accurately.
- **Responsiveness:** The willingness to help guests and provide prompt service.
- **Assurance:** The knowledge and courtesy of staff and their ability to inspire trust.
- **Empathy:** The provision of caring, individualized attention to guests.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Ecosystemic Guest Experience Model

The Ecosystemic Guest Experience Model proposes that guest experiences can be understood as interconnected systems influenced by various operational components. This model emphasizes the importance of fostering relationships between staff, guests, and organizational processes to enhance overall satisfaction. 

**Key Questions:**
- How do different service touchpoints interact to shape guest perceptions?
- What role does the physical environment play in facilitating or hindering these interactions?

#### Resilience Theory in Hospitality

Resilience theory in hospitality suggests that diversity and adaptability within service offerings and staff roles can enhance operational resilience. This theory posits that organizations that embrace change and cultivate a diverse range of services are better equipped to navigate challenges and maintain guest loyalty.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interactions between ecosystem principles and hospitality management practices. This model serves as a framework for understanding how interconnectedness, service diversity, and feedback mechanisms contribute to enhanced guest experiences and operational resilience.
