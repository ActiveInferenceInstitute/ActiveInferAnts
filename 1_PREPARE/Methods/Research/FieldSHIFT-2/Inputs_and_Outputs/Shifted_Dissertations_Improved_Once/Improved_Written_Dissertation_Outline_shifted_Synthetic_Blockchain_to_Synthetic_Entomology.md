## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The emergence of blockchain technology has revolutionized various sectors by enabling decentralized and transparent systems. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, allows for secure, immutable records of transactions that can be shared across a network without the need for a central authority. This characteristic makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring high levels of trust and transparency. Concurrently, entomology faces critical challenges, including biodiversity loss and pest management inefficiencies. The decline in insect populations, driven by habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide use, poses significant risks to ecosystems and agricultural productivity. This dissertation explores the intersection of these two fields, proposing an integrated framework that leverages blockchain's strengths to address entomological issues.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it not only bridges two distinct domains but also proposes innovative solutions to pressing ecological issues. The novelty lies in the application of blockchain principles—such as decentralized data sharing, smart contracts, and tokenization—to enhance entomological research and practices. By creating a platform that allows for secure data exchange among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, this dissertation aims to improve the quality and accessibility of entomological data, ultimately leading to better-informed decision-making in pest management and conservation efforts.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology has its roots in the early 1990s, with the concept of a "chain of blocks" proposed by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. However, it gained widespread attention with the introduction of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The key principles of blockchain include decentralization, immutability, and transparency, which have led to its adoption across various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. The technology's ability to create trustless environments has opened new avenues for data management and sharing.

#### Entomology

Entomology, the scientific study of insects, dates back to ancient civilizations where insects were studied for their ecological roles and impacts on agriculture. Major discoveries in entomology have shaped our understanding of insect behavior, physiology, and taxonomy. However, contemporary entomology faces challenges such as biodiversity loss, the rise of invasive species, and the need for sustainable pest management practices. The decline in pollinator populations, for instance, has significant implications for food security and ecosystem health.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Blockchain Technology

Recent advancements in blockchain technology include the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, which automate processes and enhance efficiency. These innovations have the potential to revolutionize data management across various sectors, including environmental science. The use of blockchain for tracking supply chains, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating peer-to-peer transactions has garnered significant interest among researchers and practitioners.

#### Entomology

Current entomological research emphasizes the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Studies have highlighted the critical roles insects play in pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. However, there is a pressing need for innovative pest management strategies that minimize environmental impacts while ensuring agricultural productivity. The integration of technology, including data analytics and remote sensing, is increasingly recognized as essential for advancing pest management practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in integrated platforms for data sharing in entomology. The lack of standardized data formats and protocols hampers collaboration among researchers and practitioners. Additionally, the potential for blockchain to enhance transparency and trust in research methodologies has not been fully explored. This dissertation seeks to address these gaps by proposing a framework that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate data sharing and improve pest management strategies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blockchain Principles

The foundational principles of blockchain technology include distributed ledger technology, which allows multiple parties to access and verify data without a central authority; smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code; and consensus mechanisms, which ensure that all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions. These principles create a robust framework for enhancing data integrity and trust in various applications.

#### Ecological Theories

Ecological theories related to biodiversity emphasize the interconnectedness of species within ecosystems and the importance of maintaining ecological balance. Theories of pest dynamics explore the interactions between pests and their natural enemies, highlighting the need for integrated pest management strategies that consider ecological relationships. Ecosystem services theory underscores the value of natural processes, such as pollination and decomposition, in supporting human well-being.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of blockchain principles with ecological frameworks leads to the development of a new theoretical model that emphasizes the importance of decentralized systems in managing insect populations and promoting biodiversity. This model posits that blockchain can enhance data sharing and collaboration among stakeholders, leading to more effective pest management strategies and conservation efforts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between blockchain technology and entomological research. It highlights how decentralized systems can improve data integrity, facilitate real-time information sharing, and promote adaptive management strategies. By incorporating blockchain principles into ecological frameworks, this model aims to provide a holistic understanding of insect management and conservation.
