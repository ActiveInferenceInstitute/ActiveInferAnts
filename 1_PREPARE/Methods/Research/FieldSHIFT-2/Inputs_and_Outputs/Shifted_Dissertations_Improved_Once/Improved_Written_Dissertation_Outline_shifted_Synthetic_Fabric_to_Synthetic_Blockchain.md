## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### The Evolution of the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has undergone significant transformations throughout history. From the intricate handwoven textiles of ancient civilizations to the mass production techniques of the Industrial Revolution, the evolution of this industry reflects broader socio-economic and technological changes. Traditional craftsmanship is often characterized by localized production methods, where artisans create unique, culturally significant textiles. However, the advent of modern manufacturing has led to the commodification of fabrics, resulting in a loss of cultural heritage and artistic expression.

| Era | Key Characteristics | Impacts on Fabric Industry |
|-----|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Ancient Civilizations | Handwoven textiles, localized craftsmanship | Preservation of cultural identity, unique designs |
| Industrial Revolution | Mass production, mechanization | Commodification, loss of artisan skills |
| Globalization | Global supply chains, fast fashion | Environmental degradation, ethical concerns |

#### The Development of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology, introduced with the release of Bitcoin in 2009, has rapidly evolved, with key milestones including the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Blockchain's core features—transparency, security, and decentralization—have made it an attractive solution for various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and the arts. The potential for blockchain to disrupt traditional business models presents an opportunity for the fabric industry to adopt innovative practices that enhance sustainability and community engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Overview of Sustainable Practices in the Fabric Industry

Sustainability has become a critical concern in the fabric industry, prompting a shift towards eco-friendly materials, ethical labor practices, and circular economy models. Various initiatives, such as the use of organic cotton, recycled fibers, and sustainable dyeing methods, have emerged to mitigate the environmental impact of textile production. However, the industry still faces challenges related to transparency and traceability, which blockchain technology can help address.

#### Examination of Blockchain Applications in Various Sectors

Blockchain technology has been successfully implemented in various sectors, including supply chain management, where it enhances transparency and traceability. In the arts, blockchain has enabled the creation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), allowing artists to tokenize their work and retain ownership rights. These applications illustrate the potential for blockchain to transform traditional practices, providing a foundation for exploring its integration into the fabric industry.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing body of research on sustainability in the fabric industry and blockchain applications in various sectors, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that combines fabric arts and blockchain technology. This gap presents significant opportunities for innovation, particularly in areas such as sustainability, community engagement, and artistic expression. By exploring these intersections, this dissertation aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how blockchain can reshape the fabric industry.

## Theoretical Framework
