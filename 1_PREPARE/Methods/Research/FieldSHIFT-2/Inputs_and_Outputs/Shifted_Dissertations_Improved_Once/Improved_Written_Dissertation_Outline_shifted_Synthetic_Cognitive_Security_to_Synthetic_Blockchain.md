## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security Development

Cognitive security has evolved in response to the increasing prevalence of misinformation and disinformation in digital communication. Early studies in cognitive psychology highlighted the susceptibility of individuals to cognitive biases, which can distort perception and decision-making. The advent of social media and digital platforms has exacerbated these issues, necessitating a framework for cognitive security that protects users from manipulative information.

Recent advancements in cognitive security research have introduced frameworks aimed at identifying, mitigating, and educating users about cognitive biases. The integration of technology into these frameworks has been limited, revealing a gap that this dissertation aims to bridge.

#### Evolution of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital transactions. Its core principles—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—have paved the way for a multitude of applications beyond cryptocurrency, including supply chain management, identity verification, and smart contracts. However, the challenges of scalability, user education, and trust remain significant hurdles in the widespread adoption of blockchain solutions.

The literature indicates that while blockchain offers a robust framework for data integrity, it does not inherently address cognitive biases that users may encounter. This gap presents a unique opportunity for integrating cognitive security principles into blockchain technology, enhancing its effectiveness.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cognitive Security Frameworks

Current cognitive security frameworks primarily focus on identifying and mitigating cognitive biases and misinformation. However, many of these frameworks lack robust mechanisms for real-time verification and user engagement. The existing literature highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches that combine cognitive security with technological advancements to enhance user resilience against misinformation.

#### Challenges in Blockchain

Blockchain technology faces challenges including scalability, energy consumption, and the need for user education. Moreover, while blockchain offers data integrity, it does not inherently address the cognitive biases that users may encounter. This gap presents an opportunity for integrating cognitive security principles to enhance the overall effectiveness of blockchain applications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive security and blockchain reveals significant gaps in the current literature and practice. The lack of interdisciplinary approaches combining these fields limits the potential for innovative solutions. This dissertation aims to explore these gaps and identify opportunities for developing new protocols, educational initiatives, and frameworks that enhance both cognitive security and blockchain technology.
