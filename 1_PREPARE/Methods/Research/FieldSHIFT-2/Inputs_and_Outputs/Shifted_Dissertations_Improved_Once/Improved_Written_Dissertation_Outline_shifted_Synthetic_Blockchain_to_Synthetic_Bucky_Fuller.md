The core attributes of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—have positioned it as a revolutionary technology capable of disrupting traditional systems of trust and authority. 

#### Buckminster Fuller
Buckminster Fuller, an architect, designer, and futurist, is renowned for his innovative contributions to sustainable design and resource management. His concepts of "Spaceship Earth" and "ephemeralization" advocate for a holistic approach to human existence, emphasizing the need for efficient resource use and collaborative problem-solving. Fuller's work, which includes the geodesic dome and Dymaxion design principles, reflects a commitment to sustainability and community empowerment.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Blockchain
Current research on blockchain applications highlights its potential in enhancing governance, improving supply chain transparency, and fostering environmental sustainability. Various studies have explored the use of blockchain in tracking renewable energy certificates, facilitating carbon trading, and managing decentralized energy grids. Despite these advancements, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate blockchain with sustainability principles.

#### Fuller’s Ideals
Contemporary interpretations of Fuller's work emphasize the relevance of his principles in addressing modern sustainability challenges. Scholars have examined Fuller's concepts in the context of urban planning, renewable energy, and community resilience. However, there is a notable gap in exploring how emerging technologies, particularly blockchain, can enhance the realization of Fuller's vision.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
