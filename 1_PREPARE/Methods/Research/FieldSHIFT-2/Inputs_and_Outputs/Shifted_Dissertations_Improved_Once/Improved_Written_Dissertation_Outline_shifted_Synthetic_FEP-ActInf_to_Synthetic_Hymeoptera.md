## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the behavior of Hymenoptera—ants, bees, and wasps. By applying the FEP framework to these insects, the research seeks to uncover new insights into their collective intelligence, communication strategies, and ecological roles. The findings are expected to advance theoretical understanding in both fields, leading to practical applications in technology and ecology. This research not only deepens our comprehension of Hymenoptera but also contributes to broader interdisciplinary dialogues, fostering new avenues for research and innovation. The implications of this work extend to fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and conservation biology, emphasizing the relevance of understanding adaptive behaviors in complex systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept that has traditionally been applied to individual organisms. This principle, rooted in thermodynamics and information theory, suggests that living systems maintain their states by reducing the discrepancies between their predictions and sensory inputs. Hymenoptera, known for their complex social structures and behaviors, present an opportunity to explore how these principles manifest at the collective level within adaptive systems. The intricate interactions observed in colonies of ants, bees, and wasps—ranging from foraging strategies to nest construction—offer a fertile ground for examining the applicability of the FEP beyond individual organisms.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it bridges cognitive science and entomology, providing a novel framework for understanding the behaviors of social insects. By reinterpreting Hymenoptera through the lens of the FEP, the dissertation aims to reveal underlying mechanisms of collective decision-making, communication, and ecological adaptation. The integration of theoretical frameworks from cognitive science into the study of social insects not only enhances our understanding of these organisms but also provides a new perspective on the nature of intelligence and adaptation in complex systems. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the behaviors of Hymenoptera be modeled as systems minimizing free energy?
2. What are the implications of collective decision-making processes in these insects for understanding adaptive systems?
3. In what ways can insights from this research inform technological innovations and ecological strategies?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

Originating in cognitive science and theoretical biology, the Free Energy Principle has primarily focused on individual organisms and their predictive capabilities. The principle, as articulated by Friston (2010), posits that organisms act to minimize the divergence between their predictions about the world and the actual sensory inputs they receive. This concept has been influential in understanding various biological processes, from neural functioning to behavioral responses.

#### Hymenoptera Behavior

Historically studied in isolation, Hymenoptera have been examined for their social structures, communication methods, and ecological impacts. Research has highlighted the sophisticated behaviors of these insects, including division of labor, foraging strategies, and nest-building techniques. However, much of this research has been descriptive, lacking a theoretical framework that could unify these observations under a broader understanding of adaptive systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in the FEP have begun to explore collective dynamics, yet its application to social insects remains underexplored. While studies have investigated individual decision-making processes in Hymenoptera, the collective aspect—how these insects operate as systems—has not been adequately addressed. Hymenoptera research has focused on individual species behaviors, lacking integration with theoretical frameworks from cognitive science.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of FEP and Hymenoptera offers a unique opportunity to fill gaps in understanding collective behavior and adaptive systems. By applying the FEP to Hymenoptera, this research seeks to elucidate how these insects minimize free energy at the colony level. There is a need for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from both domains to foster innovation, particularly in understanding how collective intelligence emerges from individual behaviors.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Active Inference

Active inference is the process through which organisms predict and adapt to their environments. It involves formulating hypotheses about the world and updating these hypotheses based on sensory feedback. This concept is crucial for understanding how organisms, including Hymenoptera, navigate their environments and make decisions based on incomplete information.

#### Collective Intelligence

Collective intelligence refers to the ability of groups to solve problems and make decisions collectively. In Hymenoptera, this is evident in behaviors such as swarm intelligence, where individuals contribute to a group's decision-making process, leading to outcomes that are often more efficient than those achievable by individuals alone.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Colony Free Energy

Colony free energy is proposed as a collective measure of surprise experienced by a colony. This construct allows for the examination of how colonies interact with their environments and make decisions that minimize free energy collectively. Understanding colony free energy can provide insights into the adaptive strategies employed by Hymenoptera.

#### Pheromone Predictions

Pheromone predictions refer to the anticipated chemical signals guiding social interactions within a colony. These signals play a crucial role in communication and decision-making, allowing individuals to coordinate their actions effectively. By modeling pheromone communication within the FEP framework, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how these signals contribute to minimizing free energy.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines the principles of the FEP with the social dynamics of Hymenoptera, framing their behaviors as adaptive strategies aimed at minimizing collective free energy. This model aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making and communication, providing a comprehensive understanding of Hymenoptera as complex adaptive systems.
