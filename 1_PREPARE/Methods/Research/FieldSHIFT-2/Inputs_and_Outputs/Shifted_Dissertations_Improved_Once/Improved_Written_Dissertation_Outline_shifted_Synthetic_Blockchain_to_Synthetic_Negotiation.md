## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Blockchain
Blockchain technology was first introduced in 2008 as the backbone of Bitcoin, proposed by an anonymous figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The key principles of blockchain include decentralization, transparency, and immutability. These features allow for a secure and verifiable record of transactions without the need for a central authority. Over the years, blockchain has found applications in various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more. The evolution of blockchain has led to the development of various consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), which ensure the integrity of the data stored on the blockchain.

#### Negotiation
Negotiation is a complex process that involves two or more parties attempting to reach an agreement. Traditional negotiation paradigms often rely on established strategies, such as distributive bargaining and integrative negotiation. These strategies are influenced by factors such as power dynamics, cultural differences, and the negotiation context. The literature on negotiation has evolved to include various theories, including game theory, which analyzes strategic interactions among rational decision-makers, and trust theory, which examines the role of trust in facilitating cooperative behavior.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Blockchain
Existing research on blockchain primarily focuses on its technical aspects, including cryptographic security, consensus algorithms, and scalability challenges. However, there is a growing body of literature exploring the social and economic implications of blockchain technology. Scholars have begun to analyze how blockchain can enhance transparency and accountability in various sectors, yet there remains a dearth of research on its application in negotiation contexts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Game Theory
Game theory provides a foundational understanding of negotiation strategies and their implications. It analyzes how individuals make decisions in situations where the outcome depends not only on their own actions but also on the actions of others. Traditional game-theoretic models, such as the Nash equilibrium, offer insights into how parties can reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, these models often assume rational behavior and do not account for the complexities of human emotions and trust dynamics.

#### Trust Theory
Trust theory explores the dynamics of trust in negotiation contexts, emphasizing the importance of trust in facilitating cooperation and reducing transaction costs. Trust is often seen as a critical factor in negotiation success, influencing parties' willingness to share information and make concessions. Understanding trust dynamics is essential for developing effective negotiation strategies, particularly in decentralized environments where traditional trust mechanisms may be lacking.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### The Blockchain Negotiation Model (BNM)
The Blockchain Negotiation Model (BNM) proposes a framework for negotiations that leverages blockchain technology to enhance transparency and accountability. This model emphasizes the importance of decentralized negotiation platforms that enable parties to interact directly without intermediaries. By utilizing smart contracts, the BNM aims to streamline negotiation processes and reduce the potential for disputes.

#### Tokenized Negotiation Incentives Model
The Tokenized Negotiation Incentives Model proposes the use of tokens to reward fair negotiation practices. This model suggests that by creating a token economy within negotiation platforms, parties can be incentivized to engage in cooperative behavior and adhere to agreed-upon terms. The behavioral implications of tokenized incentives offer a new perspective on negotiation dynamics, providing opportunities for further exploration.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
#### Decentralized Negotiation Framework
The Decentralized Negotiation Framework integrates blockchain principles into negotiation practices, offering a comprehensive model for understanding how these technologies can transform traditional negotiation processes.
