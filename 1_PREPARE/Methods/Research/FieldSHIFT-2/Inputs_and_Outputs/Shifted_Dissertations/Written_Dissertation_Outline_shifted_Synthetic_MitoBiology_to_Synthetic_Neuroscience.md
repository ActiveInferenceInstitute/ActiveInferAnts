## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, are essential organelles responsible for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. They play a pivotal role in cellular metabolism, regulating energy production, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In contrast, neural networks, composed of interconnected neurons, are responsible for processing and transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that aligns mitochondrial functions with neural processes, creating a new paradigm for understanding brain function.

The intersection of these two domains is particularly salient given the increasing recognition of the metabolic demands of neurons and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in various neurological disorders. This framework posits that insights derived from mitochondrial biology can elucidate mechanisms underlying neural function, thereby enriching our understanding of cognitive processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research will explore the isomorphisms between mitochondrial dynamics and synaptic plasticity, leading to novel hypotheses and research agendas that challenge traditional boundaries in both fields. The potential for this interdisciplinary approach lies in its ability to provide a more comprehensive understanding of brain health, particularly in the context of aging and neurodegeneration.

Furthermore, by examining the interplay between mitochondrial function and cognitive processes, this dissertation aims to identify new therapeutic targets for enhancing cognitive resilience and mitigating the effects of neurodegenerative diseases. The implications of this research extend beyond academic inquiry, offering practical applications in healthcare and public policy.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Mitochondrial Biology

Mitochondria were first identified in the mid-19th century, with their role in cellular respiration becoming evident in the early 20th century. Over the decades, research has expanded to include mitochondrial genetics, dynamics, and their involvement in apoptosis, metabolism, and cellular signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in a range of diseases, including metabolic syndromes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent advancements have highlighted the importance of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, such as mitophagy, and their role in maintaining cellular health.

#### Neural Network Theories

The development of neural network theories dates back to the early 20th century, with significant contributions from pioneers such as Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal and Donald Hebb. The Hebbian theory of synaptic plasticity, which posits that "cells that fire together wire together," laid the groundwork for understanding learning and memory at the synaptic level. In recent years, advances in neuroimaging and electrophysiology have provided deeper insights into the dynamics of neural circuits, emphasizing the importance of energy efficiency and metabolic support for optimal neural function.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Mitochondrial Research

Recent advancements in mitochondrial research have uncovered the complexities of mitochondrial function beyond ATP production. Key areas of focus include oxidative stress, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in signaling, and the mechanisms of mitophagy. The interplay between mitochondrial health and cellular signaling pathways has become a focal point in understanding how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

#### Neural Plasticity

In the realm of neuroscience, the current understanding of neural plasticity has expanded to encompass not only synaptic changes but also structural alterations in neural circuits. The concept of energy efficiency in neural networks has gained traction, emphasizing the need for adequate metabolic support to sustain cognitive function. Research has increasingly focused on the role of glial cells and the neurovascular coupling in providing the necessary energy substrates for active neurons.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary studies linking mitochondrial function to neural processes. The potential for innovation lies in merging insights from mitochondrial biology with cognitive neuroscience to develop a more integrated understanding of brain health. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing new research agendas that explore the interplay between mitochondrial dynamics and neural function.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Mitochondrial Bioenergetics

Mitochondrial bioenergetics is grounded in the principles of cellular respiration, where the electron transport chain facilitates ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The efficiency of this process is influenced by various factors, including mitochondrial membrane potential, substrate availability, and the presence of uncoupling proteins. Understanding these principles is crucial for elucidating how energy dynamics impact neuronal function.

#### Neural Network Theory

Neural network theory encompasses a range of models that describe how neurons communicate and adapt in response to stimuli. The Hebbian theory of synaptic plasticity serves as a foundational concept, while more recent models incorporate the influence of metabolic factors on synaptic strength and connectivity. The energy demands of neural networks, particularly during learning and memory processes, highlight the necessity of integrating metabolic considerations into cognitive neuroscience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The concept of "Neural Mitochondrial Efficiency" (NME) emerges as a critical construct in understanding the relationship between mitochondrial function and cognitive performance. NME refers to the capacity of neuronal mitochondria to efficiently produce ATP in response to synaptic activity, thereby supporting the energy demands of active neural circuits. This construct will be operationalized through metrics assessing mitochondrial function in various neural contexts.
