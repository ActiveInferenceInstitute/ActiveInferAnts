## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain

Blockchain technology originated with Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The initial purpose was to create a decentralized digital currency that could operate without a central authority. Over the years, the technology has evolved, giving rise to various applications beyond cryptocurrency, including smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and more. The fundamental principles of blockchain—decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and cryptographic security—have paved the way for innovative solutions across multiple sectors.

#### Logistics

The field of logistics has a rich history, evolving from basic transportation practices to complex supply chain management systems. Historically, logistics focused on the physical movement of goods, but with the advent of technology, it has expanded to encompass inventory management, demand forecasting, and supplier relationship management. The integration of information technology in logistics has led to improvements in operational efficiency, yet challenges related to transparency and trust remain prevalent.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Blockchain

Existing research on blockchain applications spans various industries, highlighting its potential to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency. Scholars have explored blockchain's role in finance, healthcare, and supply chain management, among others. However, the logistics sector has been relatively underexplored, with limited empirical studies examining the practical implications of blockchain integration.

#### Logistics

Contemporary logistics practices increasingly leverage technology, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. Despite these advancements, the industry continues to grapple with challenges such as fraud, inefficiencies, and a lack of real-time visibility. The intersection of blockchain and logistics presents an opportunity to address these issues through innovative solutions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals significant gaps in the integration of blockchain technology within logistics. While there is a growing body of research on blockchain's theoretical underpinnings, empirical studies examining its practical applications in logistics remain scarce. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring the potential of blockchain to enhance operational efficiency, transparency, and trust within the logistics sector. Furthermore, the Shifted Domain presents opportunities for innovation, including the development of decentralized logistics networks and automated compliance systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blockchain Theories

Key theories from blockchain research include decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and trust models. Decentralization refers to the distribution of authority across a network, reducing reliance on a single entity. Consensus mechanisms, such as proof of work and proof of stake, ensure that all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions. Trust models, including reputation systems and cryptographic security, facilitate secure interactions among parties without the need for intermediaries.

#### Logistics Theories

Logistics theories encompass supply chain management, systems theory, and operational efficiency. Supply chain management focuses on the coordination of activities involved in the production and delivery of goods. Systems theory emphasizes the interconnectivity of various components within a supply chain, while operational efficiency highlights the importance of optimizing processes to reduce costs and improve service delivery.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### LogiChain Theory

LogiChain Theory emerges as a new framework for understanding blockchain's role in logistics. It posits that the integration of blockchain technology can create a more resilient and adaptive logistics ecosystem by enhancing transparency, trust, and efficiency. This theory emphasizes the need for collaboration among supply chain partners and the importance of decentralized models in fostering innovation.

#### Smart Logistics Contracts

Smart Logistics Contracts represent a conceptualization of automated agreements within logistics operations. These contracts leverage blockchain technology to facilitate real-time transactions, automate compliance, and streamline processes. The theoretical construct emphasizes the potential for smart contracts to reduce administrative burdens and enhance operational efficiency.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model combines blockchain principles with logistics management theories, illustrating their interdependencies and synergies. The model highlights how decentralization, immutability, and smart contracts can transform traditional logistics practices, leading to improved transparency, trust, and efficiency. This framework serves as a foundation for empirical research and practical applications.
