## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security is a relatively nascent field that has evolved in response to the increasing sophistication of misinformation tactics. Historically, it emerged from the fields of psychology and information warfare, focusing on the protection of cognitive processes from external manipulations. Key strategies within cognitive security include media literacy programs, critical thinking training, and the development of technologies designed to detect and counter misinformation.

#### Information Integrity

Information integrity has a longer historical context, rooted in the principles of information theory and data management. The importance of data accuracy, validation, and provenance has become paramount in the digital landscape, where vast amounts of data are generated and shared daily. The evolution of information integrity practices has been influenced by technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and the growing recognition of the value of trustworthy information in decision-making processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in cognitive security has primarily focused on understanding the psychological mechanisms behind misinformation susceptibility and developing strategies to mitigate its effects. In parallel, the field of information integrity has seen advancements in methodologies and technologies aimed at ensuring data accuracy. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that bridge these two domains, highlighting a significant gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain presents an opportunity to develop new frameworks and tools that enhance data reliability through cognitive awareness. By integrating cognitive security principles into information integrity practices, researchers can address the cognitive biases that lead to data inaccuracies. This interdisciplinary approach not only fills existing gaps in the literature but also opens new avenues for research and practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical foundation of this dissertation draws from cognitive psychology and information theory. Cognitive psychology provides insights into cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring, and the Dunning-Kruger effect, all of which can distort data interpretation and validation. Information theory, on the other hand, offers principles related to data integrity, including error detection, redundancy, and the importance of data provenance.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The proposed integration of cognitive security principles into information integrity frameworks leads to the emergence of new theoretical constructs. These constructs address the cognitive biases that influence data validation and propose a model that incorporates cognitive security strategies into traditional data governance practices. This model aims to create a more resilient framework for ensuring data integrity in an increasingly complex digital environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between cognitive security, cognitive biases, and information integrity. It posits that by understanding and addressing cognitive biases, organizations can enhance their data validation processes, thereby improving overall information integrity. This model serves as a foundation for the development of practical frameworks and methodologies that bridge the gap between cognitive security and information integrity.

The research will adhere to ethical guidelines established by relevant institutional review boards.

## Core Chapters

### Key Aspect 1: Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on Data Integrity

#### Sub-section 1: Types of Cognitive Biases

Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, which can significantly impact data interpretation and validation. Common biases include:

- **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.
- **Anchoring**: The reliance on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions, which can skew subsequent judgments.
- **Overconfidence Bias**: The tendency to overestimate one's knowledge or ability, leading to errors in data assessment.

#### Sub-section 2: Empirical Evidence of Bias Impact

Empirical evidence demonstrates that cognitive biases can lead to significant inaccuracies in data interpretation. Case studies, such as those related to public health data during the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrate how biases influenced public perception and decision-making. For instance, confirmation bias may have led individuals to disregard conflicting data about the virus's transmission, thereby impacting public health responses.
