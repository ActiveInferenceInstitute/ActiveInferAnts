## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of two distinct fields: the rich, visionary world of William Blake's poetry and art, and the scientific rigor of the Free Energy Principle, which explains how living systems maintain their integrity through predictive coding and active inference. This interdisciplinary exploration seeks to redefine cognitive processes by integrating creative and spiritual dimensions. 

William Blake (1757-1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker, whose works reflect a complex interplay of imagination, spirituality, and social critique. His artistic philosophy revolves around the notion of contraries, which he believed were essential to human experience and understanding. The Free Energy Principle, proposed by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize surprise by predicting sensory inputs, thereby maintaining a state of homeostasis. This dissertation seeks to align Blake’s visionary insights with the scientific principles of cognitive functioning.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges the traditional boundaries between art and science, proposing that creativity and spirituality are essential components of cognitive functioning. By investigating how Blake's work can inform our understanding of cognitive processes, this dissertation highlights the transformative potential of art in understanding human cognition and behavior. 

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which brings together the realms of literary and artistic analysis with cognitive science. This synthesis not only enriches our understanding of Blake’s contributions but also offers new insights into mental health, education, and technological innovation. By framing Blake’s work within the context of the Free Energy Principle, the research opens new avenues for exploring the cognitive and therapeutic applications of art.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Blake's concepts of contraries inform our understanding of predictive coding in the brain?
2. In what ways does imagination serve as an active inference strategy in cognitive processes?
3. How do spiritual beliefs function as generative models that shape perception and decision-making?
4. What are the practical applications of these insights in educational and therapeutic contexts?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of William Blake's Life, Artistic Philosophy, and Key Works

William Blake was born in London and spent much of his life there, producing a body of work that includes poetry, paintings, and engravings. His major works, such as "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and "The Book of Urizen," reflect his unique vision of the world, characterized by a deep exploration of the human condition, spirituality, and the nature of reality. 

Blake’s artistic philosophy is centered around the idea of contraries, which he articulated as a necessary tension within the human experience. He believed that opposites—such as innocence and experience, good and evil, heaven and hell—are essential for understanding the complexities of life. This duality is mirrored in his artistic techniques, which often juxtapose vibrant imagery with profound philosophical themes.

#### Examination of the Free Energy Principle, Its Origins, and Its Implications for Cognitive Science

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has its roots in statistical mechanics and information theory. Karl Friston, a leading neuroscientist, formulated this principle to describe how biological systems maintain their organization and function. The FEP posits that organisms minimize their free energy—essentially, the difference between their predictions and sensory inputs—by updating their internal models of the world.

This principle has profound implications for cognitive science, as it suggests that perception, action, and learning are fundamentally about minimizing surprise. Predictive coding, a key component of the FEP, posits that the brain continuously generates and updates predictions about sensory inputs, allowing for efficient processing and adaptation to the environment.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Existing Literature on Blake's Influence on Art and Spirituality

The existing literature on William Blake largely focuses on his contributions to literature, art, and spirituality. Scholars such as Northrop Frye and Kathleen Raine have explored Blake's vision of the interconnectedness of humanity, nature, and the divine. His work has been interpreted through various lenses, including Romanticism, mysticism, and social critique. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the intersection of Blake's insights with contemporary cognitive science.

#### Review of Research on the Free Energy Principle, Including Predictive Coding and Active Inference

Research on the Free Energy Principle has gained momentum in recent years, with applications in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Studies have demonstrated how predictive coding models can explain various cognitive phenomena, including perception, attention, and decision-making. However, there is limited exploration of how these principles can be enriched by artistic and spiritual perspectives, particularly those offered by figures like Blake.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in existing research highlights the need for interdisciplinary studies that connect art and cognitive science. While there has been substantial work on the individual contributions of Blake and the Free Energy Principle, the lack of synthesis between these domains presents an opportunity for new insights. By exploring how Blake's artistic and spiritual insights can inform cognitive processes, this dissertation aims to fill this void and propose a novel framework for understanding human cognition.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blake’s Theories of Contraries and Imagination

Blake’s theories of contraries emphasize the importance of dualities in understanding the human experience. He posited that the tension between opposites fuels creativity and insight. This concept can be aligned with cognitive theories that emphasize the role of conflict and contradiction in cognitive processing. Furthermore, Blake’s notion of imagination as a transformative force underpins his artistic endeavors, suggesting that imaginative engagement is crucial for cognitive flexibility and innovation.

#### Theoretical Underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle, Including Predictive Coding and Generative Models

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the idea that living systems are fundamentally predictive in nature. Predictive coding posits that the brain continually generates predictions about sensory inputs, which are then updated based on the discrepancy between predictions and actual inputs. Generative models, on the other hand, represent the brain's internal understanding of the world, allowing for adaptive behavior in response to changing environments.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Conceptualizing Blakean Predictive Coding

This dissertation proposes the concept of "Blakean Predictive Coding," which integrates Blake’s ideas of contraries and imagination with the principles of predictive coding. This framework posits that the brain's ability to navigate conflicting information is enhanced by creative engagement, allowing for richer and more nuanced understandings of reality.

#### Defining Imaginative Active Inference and Spiritual Generative Models

The notion of "Imaginative Active Inference" is introduced to describe how artistic engagement fosters cognitive flexibility and enhances the brain's capacity for active inference—where individuals actively seek information to resolve uncertainty. Additionally, "Spiritual Generative Models" are proposed to encompass the ways in which spiritual beliefs shape cognitive frameworks and influence perception, decision-making, and behavior.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model developed in this dissertation synthesizes Blake’s insights with cognitive science principles, creating a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between art, imagination, and cognition. This model posits that engaging with artistic works, particularly those that embody Blakean themes, can enhance cognitive processes by fostering imaginative capacities and promoting a deeper understanding of the self and the world.
