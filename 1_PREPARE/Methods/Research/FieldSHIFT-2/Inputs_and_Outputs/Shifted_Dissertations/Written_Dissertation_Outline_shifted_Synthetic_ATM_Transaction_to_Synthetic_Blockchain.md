# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the convergence of two distinct fieldsâ€”ATM transactions and blockchain technology. ATMs have long provided users with autonomous access to banking services, allowing for efficient cash withdrawals, deposits, and account inquiries. Their design prioritizes user experience through intuitive interfaces and secure transactions. Conversely, blockchain technology offers a decentralized framework for secure transactions, characterized by transparency, immutability, and resistance to fraud. This intersection presents a unique opportunity to enhance financial services through innovative applications that prioritize user experience and security.

The integration of ATM principles into blockchain technology can address significant challenges in the financial sector, such as security vulnerabilities, user distrust, and accessibility issues. By leveraging the structured interaction model of ATMs, blockchain applications can be designed to be more user-friendly, thus fostering greater adoption among a diverse user base, including the unbanked and underbanked populations.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to create a comprehensive framework that combines the best practices of ATM transactions with the advantages of blockchain technology. This novel approach can lead to the development of user-friendly interfaces and automated financial services that cater to a broader audience, including those who are traditionally underserved by the banking system.

Moreover, this research contributes to the broader discourse on financial inclusion, as it proposes solutions that can democratize access to financial services. By focusing on user experience, security, and accessibility, the findings of this dissertation are poised to inform the design of future financial technologies, thereby influencing policy and practice within the financial services industry.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

This section provides an overview of the evolution of ATM transactions and blockchain technology, highlighting key milestones, technological advancements, and their respective impacts on the financial sector.

### Evolution of ATM Transactions

The inception of ATMs in the late 1960s revolutionized the banking landscape by providing users with 24/7 access to their accounts. The early machines allowed basic functions such as cash withdrawals, but advancements in technology have led to the incorporation of sophisticated features like deposits, bill payments, and account management. The standardization of ATM interfaces has significantly improved user experience, making banking services more accessible to the general public.

### Emergence of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology emerged in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, presenting a decentralized ledger system that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. The underlying principles of cryptography, decentralization, and consensus mechanisms have paved the way for various applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and supply chain management. The growing interest in blockchain has prompted significant research into its potential to disrupt traditional financial services.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An analysis of the current literature on ATM transactions and blockchain technology reveals a rich tapestry of research focused on user autonomy, security protocols, and usability features. 

### User Autonomy

User autonomy in ATM transactions is characterized by the ability of individuals to perform banking tasks independently, without the need for direct interaction with bank staff. This autonomy is crucial for enhancing user confidence and satisfaction. In blockchain technology, user autonomy is further amplified through decentralized systems that empower users to control their financial assets without intermediaries.

### Security Protocols

Security is a paramount concern in both domains. ATM transactions utilize multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure networks to protect user data. Similarly, blockchain employs cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and maintain the integrity of the ledger. However, vulnerabilities remain in both systems, necessitating continuous advancements in security protocols.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This section identifies existing gaps in the literature regarding user experience in blockchain applications and the potential for integrating ATM principles. Despite the growing body of research on blockchain usability, studies focusing on user experience are limited. The Shifted Domain presents opportunities for further exploration, particularly in designing interfaces that enhance user engagement and trust.

Research opportunities include:

- Investigating the applicability of ATM design principles to blockchain interfaces.
- Exploring user perceptions of security and usability in blockchain applications.
- Developing frameworks that facilitate the adoption of blockchain technology among diverse user groups.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

This section discusses key theories from the fields of ATM transactions (e.g., user autonomy, transaction flow) and blockchain (e.g., decentralization, consensus mechanisms) that will inform the research.

### User Autonomy

User autonomy theory posits that individuals are more likely to engage with systems that empower them to make independent decisions. In the context of ATMs, this autonomy is facilitated through intuitive interfaces and clear transaction flows. In blockchain systems, user autonomy is enhanced by eliminating intermediaries, allowing users full control over their transactions.

### Decentralization

Decentralization is a core principle of blockchain technology, enabling distributed control and reducing reliance on centralized authorities. This principle aligns with the user-centric design of ATMs, which aim to provide services without the need for direct bank interaction. Understanding the implications of decentralization for user experience is crucial for this research.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

New theoretical constructs that arise from the integration of ATM and blockchain principles will be proposed, including concepts such as decentralized user experience and smart ATM contracts. 

### Decentralized User Experience

This construct emphasizes the importance of designing user experiences that leverage the benefits of decentralization while maintaining the familiarity of traditional banking interfaces. By focusing on user-centric design, applications can facilitate smoother transitions for users new to blockchain technology.

### Smart ATM Contracts

Smart ATM contracts represent an innovative application of blockchain technology within the ATM framework. These contracts can automate transactions based on predefined conditions, enhancing efficiency and security while providing users with greater control over their financial interactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the relationship between ATM transaction principles and blockchain technology, serving as a foundation for the research. This model will highlight the interplay between user experience, security, and accessibility, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the proposed integration.
