# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the convergence of two distinct fields—ATM transactions and blockchain technology. Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have long provided users with autonomous access to banking services, facilitating cash withdrawals, deposits, and account inquiries with ease and efficiency. The design and functionality of ATMs prioritize user experience, offering intuitive interfaces and robust security measures that foster user trust. In contrast, blockchain technology represents a decentralized framework for secure transactions, characterized by its transparency, immutability, and resistance to fraud. This intersection presents a unique opportunity to enhance financial services through innovative applications that prioritize user experience and security.

The integration of these two domains aims to leverage the strengths of each—combining the user-friendly, familiar aspects of ATM interactions with the advanced security and transparency features of blockchain. This synthesis can lead to the development of financial applications that not only meet the demands of tech-savvy users but also cater to those who may be intimidated by traditional blockchain interfaces.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to create a comprehensive framework that combines the best practices of ATM transactions with the advantages of blockchain technology. This novel approach can lead to the development of user-friendly interfaces and automated financial services that cater to a broader audience, including those who are traditionally underserved by the banking system. By focusing on user experience, security, and accessibility, the proposed Shifted Domain can mitigate the barriers to blockchain adoption and promote financial inclusion.

Additionally, the research will contribute to the academic discourse on the intersection of finance and technology by introducing new theoretical constructs and practical applications. The findings will not only advance knowledge in both fields but also provide a roadmap for practitioners seeking to implement user-centric blockchain solutions.
