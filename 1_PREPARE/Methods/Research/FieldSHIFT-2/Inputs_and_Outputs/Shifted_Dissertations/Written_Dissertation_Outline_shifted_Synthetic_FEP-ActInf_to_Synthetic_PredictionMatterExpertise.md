## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how adaptive systems, including biological organisms, minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and homeostasis. This principle posits that living organisms are fundamentally driven to reduce uncertainty about their environment by predicting sensory inputs and adjusting their actions accordingly.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Development of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, with significant contributions from cognitive science and neuroscience. Early formulations by Helmholtz and later developments by Friston have established the FEP as a unifying theory for understanding adaptive behavior in biological systems. The principle asserts that organisms strive to minimize free energy, which corresponds to the difference between expected sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs. This minimization process is achieved through predictive coding, where the brain generates hypotheses about the environment and updates them based on incoming data.

#### Evolution of Prediction Matter Expertise

Prediction Matter Expertise has evolved as a response to the increasing complexity of knowledge and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge across different domains, enabling practitioners to make informed predictions and decisions. This evolution has been driven by advancements in technology, data analytics, and the recognition of the limitations of siloed knowledge. PME has gained prominence in various fields, including business, healthcare, and education, where decision-making relies on the integration of diverse perspectives and expertise.
