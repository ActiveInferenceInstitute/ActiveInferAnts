## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a framework for understanding how adaptive systems, including biological organisms, minimize variational free energy to maintain stability. FEP posits that living systems strive to reduce the discrepancy between their predictions and sensory inputs, thereby achieving homeostasis and optimal functioning. This principle has profound implications for cognitive processes, suggesting that perception and action are fundamentally predictive in nature.

In contrast, Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) focuses on the ability to synthesize knowledge across disciplines to make informed predictions. PME emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the continuous integration of new information to enhance decision-making capabilities. This dissertation seeks to fuse these two domains, exploring how principles from FEP can enhance the predictive capabilities and decision-making processes within PME.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

By applying FEP concepts to PME, this dissertation will introduce novel frameworks and methodologies that can transform decision-making in complex, uncertain environments. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of FEP principles into PME, offering a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis. This work not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also proposes actionable strategies for practitioners in various fields.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, evolving into a powerful framework for understanding cognitive processes. Key figures such as Karl Friston have articulated the implications of FEP for biological systems, emphasizing its role in active inference and predictive coding. This historical trajectory highlights the principle's relevance in explaining how organisms adapt to their environments.

Prediction Matter Expertise, on the other hand, has emerged from the need for effective decision-making in complex, interdisciplinary contexts. Early work in this area focused on the synthesis of knowledge from diverse fields to enhance predictive capabilities. The evolution of PME reflects an increasing recognition of the importance of collaboration and continuous learning in an ever-changing world.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The literature on the Free Energy Principle is extensive, encompassing topics such as variational free energy, active inference, and predictive coding. Key studies illustrate how these concepts can be applied to understand cognitive processes, including perception, action, and learning. However, there remains a need for empirical investigations that operationalize these principles in practical settings.

In the realm of Prediction Matter Expertise, recent research has focused on cross-disciplinary synthesis, continuous learning, and decision-making processes. Scholars have explored frameworks for integrating knowledge from various domains, yet there is a lack of comprehensive studies that examine how FEP can inform PME practices. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research that bridges these two fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of FEP into PME reveals significant gaps in the literature, particularly regarding the operationalization of theoretical principles in practical contexts. By identifying these gaps, this dissertation aims to pave the way for interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge synthesis, fostering a deeper understanding of how predictive mechanisms can enhance decision-making across diverse fields.
