# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### ATM Transactions

The evolution of ATMs from basic cash dispensers to multifunctional banking machines illustrates the rapid technological advancements in the financial sector. Initially introduced in the late 1960s, ATMs primarily served as cash withdrawal points. However, over the decades, they have been enhanced to facilitate a wide array of transactions, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. The significance of self-service technology in enhancing customer convenience cannot be overstated; ATMs have reduced wait times, increased accessibility, and provided users with greater control over their banking activities.

### Fabric Industry and Arts

The fabric industry has a rich historical context characterized by traditional production methods and the evolution of textile design influenced by cultural and technological advancements. From handwoven fabrics to industrialized textile manufacturing, the journey reflects broader societal changes. Today, the industry grapples with sustainability challenges, as consumers increasingly demand eco-friendly practices and products. This shift necessitates a reevaluation of production methods and consumer engagement strategies, creating an opportunity for innovative solutions that incorporate technological advancements.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
