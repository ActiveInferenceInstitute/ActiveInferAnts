## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fabric industry has long operated under a linear model characterized by mass production and consumption, leading to environmental degradation and waste. The traditional approach, often referred to as the "take-make-dispose" model, has resulted in significant ecological footprints, including water pollution, excessive waste, and the depletion of natural resources. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2017), the global fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual carbon emissions and is the second-largest consumer of the world's water supply. 

In contrast, biological ecosystems thrive on principles that promote sustainability and resilience. Ecosystems are characterized by intricate relationships among organisms and their environment, where energy flows through food webs, and nutrient cycling ensures the continuous availability of resources. This dissertation will investigate how these ecological principles can be transposed into the fabric industry to create a more sustainable and interconnected system, ultimately fostering a circular economy.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Biology and Ecosystems

A review of the evolution of ecological theories reveals a rich tapestry of ideas that have shaped our understanding of biological systems. Early ecological theories, such as those proposed by Charles Darwin and his theory of natural selection, laid the groundwork for understanding species interactions and the delicate balance of ecosystems. The development of systems theory in the mid-20th century further advanced ecological thought, emphasizing the importance of interrelationships and feedback loops within ecosystems (Bertalanffy, 1968). 

Contemporary ecological research has shifted towards sustainability and conservation, addressing the urgent need to protect biodiversity and ecosystems in the face of climate change and human activity. The concept of ecosystem services, which refers to the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems, has gained prominence as a framework for understanding the value of biodiversity (Daily, 1997).

#### Fabric Industry and Arts

The fabric industry has undergone significant transformations throughout history. From artisanal craftsmanship to the advent of the Industrial Revolution, textile production has shifted towards mass production techniques that prioritize efficiency over sustainability. The rise of fast fashion in the late 20th century epitomizes this shift, with brands producing low-cost garments at an unprecedented scale, leading to environmental degradation and social inequities (Joy et al., 2012).

The historical overview of textile arts highlights the cultural significance of fabrics and their role in human expression and identity. Traditional textile practices often reflect local ecosystems and cultural narratives, emphasizing the importance of sustainability in preserving both environmental and cultural heritage.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Ecology and Sustainability

Contemporary research in ecology emphasizes the need for sustainable practices that mitigate environmental impacts. Key areas of focus include conservation biology, restoration ecology, and the study of ecological resilience. For instance, resilience theory posits that ecosystems can absorb disturbances while maintaining their functions and structures, providing valuable insights for managing natural resources sustainably (Holling, 1973).

#### Fabric Industry Practices

Current practices in the fabric industry are increasingly scrutinized for their environmental impact. The rise of fast fashion has led to a growing awareness of the negative consequences of overconsumption, prompting consumers and industry stakeholders to seek more sustainable alternatives. Research indicates that sustainable practices, such as the use of organic materials, ethical labor practices, and waste reduction strategies, can significantly reduce the ecological footprint of textile production (Fletcher, 2014).

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing body of research on sustainability, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that integrate ecological principles into industrial practices. The fabric industry has yet to fully embrace the potential of ecological frameworks to inform sustainable production methods. This dissertation aims to identify opportunities for innovation in sustainable textile production through the application of ecosystem theories, ultimately contributing to the development of a more resilient and interconnected fabric ecosystem.
