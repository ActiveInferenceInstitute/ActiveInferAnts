Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that posits that organisms generate and update predictions about sensory inputs based on prior experiences. This mechanism allows for efficient processing of information, as the brain can focus on discrepancies between expected and actual inputs, minimizing cognitive load. Predictive coding operates on the principle of minimizing prediction error, enabling organisms to adapt to their environments effectively.

In the context of the Spatial Web, predictive coding offers insights into how users interact with digital content. By understanding user expectations and preferences, designers can create more intuitive interfaces that align with users' mental models, enhancing overall engagement.

#### Active Inference
Active inference is a complementary concept to predictive coding, emphasizing the role of action in confirming predictions and minimizing surprise. According to this framework, organisms engage in actions that align with their predictions, thereby reducing uncertainty in their environments. Active inference highlights the dynamic interplay between perception and action, suggesting that users actively shape their experiences based on their expectations.

In the Spatial Web, active inference can optimize interactions with IoT devices, enabling systems to adapt to user behavior and preferences in real time. By leveraging active inference principles, designers can create systems that not only respond to user inputs but also anticipate user needs, resulting in more seamless and engaging experiences.

#### Variational Free Energy
Variational free energy is a key concept within FEP, representing a measure of the discrepancy between a system's predictions and its actual sensory inputs. By minimizing variational free energy, adaptive systems can maintain their integrity and function effectively in dynamic environments. This framework provides a quantitative approach to understanding how systems interact with their surroundings and adapt to changes.

In the context of the Spatial Web, variational free energy can inform the design of adaptive systems that learn from user interactions. By continuously updating their internal models based on user behavior, these systems can enhance user experiences and optimize interactions.
