## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of biological ecosystem concepts into the realm of ATM transactions represents a pioneering approach to understanding and optimizing banking services. The traditional view of ATMs as mere transactional machines overlooks the complexities and interdependencies inherent in their networks. By applying ecological principles, we can gain insights into the dynamics of ATM usage, user interactions, and system performance. This research recognizes that ATM networks, much like biological ecosystems, consist of diverse components that interact in multifaceted ways. Such an interdisciplinary approach allows for a deeper understanding of the factors that influence user behavior and system efficacy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields—biology and banking technology—offering fresh insights into user behavior, system dynamics, and resilience. The novelty lies in applying ecological principles to enhance the functionality and reliability of ATMs, potentially transforming the banking landscape. By viewing ATMs through an ecological lens, we can identify critical features that serve as keystone species within the ATM ecosystem, thus informing design and operational strategies that prioritize user experience and system robustness.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
This dissertation will address the following research questions:
1. How can biological concepts enhance our understanding of ATM transaction dynamics?
2. What are the key features (keystone species) that significantly impact user experience and transaction success?
3. In what ways can increasing transaction diversity improve user satisfaction and engagement?
4. What predictive models can be developed to anticipate user behavior based on ecological principles?

The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive framework that applies ecological theories to ATM transactions, ultimately leading to improved user experience and system performance.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Biology and Ecosystems
The evolution of ecological studies has been marked by significant milestones, from early naturalist observations to contemporary research focusing on biodiversity, energy flow, and resilience. Key concepts such as the interconnectedness of species, the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem stability, and the flow of energy through trophic levels provide a foundation for understanding complex systems. The work of ecologists like Charles Elton and Eugene Odum has emphasized the significance of keystone species and ecological networks, which are crucial for maintaining ecosystem health and functionality.

#### ATM Transactions
The history of ATMs dates back to the 1960s, with the introduction of the first cash-dispensing machine. Over the decades, ATMs have evolved from simple cash dispensers to sophisticated machines offering a wide range of banking services. Technological advancements have enabled features such as mobile banking integration, biometric authentication, and real-time transaction processing. However, despite these innovations, challenges remain in user experience, security, and the integration of ATMs with broader banking systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary research in ecology emphasizes the need for conservation, understanding climate change impacts, and recognizing the value of ecosystem services. Studies highlight the importance of maintaining biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems in the face of environmental stressors. In parallel, the banking sector faces challenges such as security breaches, declining user engagement, and the necessity for technological integration. Current literature indicates a gap in interdisciplinary approaches that leverage ecological insights to enhance banking technology.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The intersection of biology and banking technology presents an opportunity to address gaps in both fields. There is a notable lack of interdisciplinary approaches in banking technology, particularly regarding the application of ecological resilience concepts to enhance ATM networks. This research aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel framework that integrates ecological principles into the analysis and design of ATM systems, ultimately fostering a more adaptive and user-centric financial ecosystem.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecological Theories
Key ecological theories relevant to this research include the theory of ecological resilience, which posits that ecosystems can absorb disturbances while maintaining their fundamental structures and functions. Other important theories include the niche theory, which explains how species interact within ecosystems, and the concept of trophic cascades, which illustrates the impact of keystone species on community dynamics. These theories provide a lens through which we can analyze ATM networks as complex systems characterized by interactions between users, transactions, and ATM features.

#### Banking Theories
Traditional banking theories focus on user behavior, transaction processing, and network security. Theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) offer insights into how users adopt and engage with banking technologies. Additionally, theories of transaction cost economics highlight the importance of minimizing costs associated with transactions, which can be applied to enhance ATM efficiency and user satisfaction.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This research proposes the development of new constructs that integrate ecological and banking theories, such as the ATM Ecosystem Model. This model illustrates the interactions between users, transactions, and ATM features, emphasizing the importance of diversity and resilience within the ATM network. By framing ATMs as ecosystems, we can better understand the dynamics that influence user behavior and system performance.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model combines ecological principles with ATM transaction dynamics. It highlights the interdependencies and feedback loops within the system, illustrating how user actions and ATM features influence transaction success and overall network resilience. This model serves as a foundation for empirical research and practical applications, guiding the analysis of ATM networks through an ecological lens.

## Methodology

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of biology and ATM transactions. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of user experiences, transaction dynamics, and system resilience.

### Data Collection Methods
Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with ATM users to gather insights on user experience and satisfaction. The surveys will include questions related to transaction diversity, feature preferences, and overall satisfaction with ATM services. Additionally, transaction data from banking institutions will be analyzed to assess patterns and behaviors, providing a quantitative basis for understanding user interactions within the ATM ecosystem.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analysis will be employed to identify correlations between transaction diversity and user satisfaction. Techniques such as regression analysis and factor analysis will be utilized to uncover relationships between variables. Network analysis will also be conducted to model the interactions within the ATM ecosystem, providing insights into how different features and user behaviors influence overall system performance.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Ensuring the confidentiality and anonymity of participants in surveys and interviews is essential, as is obtaining necessary approvals from institutional review boards. Participants will be informed of their rights and the purpose of the research, fostering transparency and trust.
