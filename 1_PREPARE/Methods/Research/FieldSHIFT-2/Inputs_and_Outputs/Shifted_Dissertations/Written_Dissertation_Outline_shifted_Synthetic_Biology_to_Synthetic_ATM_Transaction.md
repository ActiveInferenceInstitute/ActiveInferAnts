## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of Ecological Theories and Their Foundational Concepts
Ecology, as a discipline, studies the interactions between organisms and their environments. Foundational concepts such as ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecological resilience provide critical insights into how systems function and adapt. The work of ecologists like Eugene Odum and C.S. Holling has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of ecological dynamics, emphasizing the importance of interconnectedness and adaptability within ecosystems. These principles can be translated into the banking sector, particularly in the context of ATM transactions, where user interactions and system functionalities are interdependent.

#### Examination of the Evolution of ATM Technology and Transaction Processes
The evolution of ATM technology has been marked by significant advancements, from the introduction of the first ATM in the 1960s to the current generation of smart ATMs, which offer a range of services beyond cash withdrawal. The transaction process has also evolved, driven by technological innovations such as contactless payments and mobile banking. Understanding this historical context is essential for identifying areas where ecological principles can be applied to enhance ATM operations and user experiences.
