## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry is characterized by a relentless pursuit of delivering personalized and high-quality guest experiences. This sector has evolved significantly, driven by technological advancements and changing consumer expectations. The principles of personalization, service quality, and technology integration have become paramount to ensuring guest satisfaction and loyalty. Similarly, Hymenoptera, which includes ants and bees, exhibit remarkable social behaviors that demonstrate collective intelligence and intricate communication systems. The complex interactions within these colonies provide a rich field for exploration, particularly when viewed through the lens of human-centric hospitality principles.

This dissertation proposes a novel framework that merges these two domains, allowing for a deeper understanding of social structures in insects. By applying hospitality concepts to the behaviors of Hymenoptera, we can uncover new insights into their social dynamics, ultimately enhancing our understanding of both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its potential to bridge gaps between entomology and hospitality management, creating a new interdisciplinary field. The novelty lies in applying human-centric hospitality concepts to the natural behaviors of Hymenoptera, offering fresh perspectives on both guest experience and ecological interactions. This approach not only enriches our understanding of social insects but also provides a framework for enhancing service delivery in the hospitality industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience in hospitality inform our understanding of collective behaviors in Hymenoptera?
2. What are the implications of transposing hospitality concepts onto the social structures and behaviors of ants?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach lead to practical applications in both fields?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience in the hospitality industry has been shaped by various factors, including cultural shifts, technological advancements, and changing consumer preferences. The concept of personalization has emerged as a critical component, with businesses striving to tailor experiences to individual needs. Service quality has also gained prominence, with frameworks such as the SERVQUAL model providing insights into the dimensions of service delivery. Furthermore, technology integration has transformed the landscape, with digital tools enabling enhanced communication and service efficiency.

#### Hymenoptera

The study of Hymenoptera has a rich historical context, with early entomologists documenting the intricate social structures and behaviors of ants and bees. Research has focused on various aspects, including communication systems, division of labor, and ecological roles. The concept of collective intelligence has been pivotal in understanding how individual behaviors contribute to the success of the colony. Recent studies have explored foraging strategies, nest construction, and the impact of environmental factors on colony dynamics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current state of knowledge in hospitality emphasizes the importance of guest satisfaction metrics and innovative service delivery methods. Studies have highlighted the role of technology in enhancing the guest experience, with mobile applications and data analytics providing valuable insights into consumer behavior.

In contrast, research on Hymenoptera has advanced our understanding of social behavior, with studies focusing on collective decision-making, communication through pheromones, and the ecological implications of ant and bee interactions. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects these two domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identified gap lies in the absence of research linking hospitality principles with insect behavior. By exploring this intersection, we can enhance our understanding of ecological systems through human-centric frameworks. This research presents an opportunity to develop new theories and models that can inform both hospitality practices and ecological research, ultimately benefiting both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory

Service quality theory provides a framework for assessing service delivery in the hospitality industry. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, identifies five dimensions of service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. This model serves as a foundation for evaluating guest experiences and understanding the factors that contribute to satisfaction.

#### Social Insect Theory

Social insect theory offers insights into the organization and communication within Hymenoptera colonies. The concept of division of labor, as articulated by Wilson (1971), emphasizes the roles of different castes within the colony and their contributions to overall success. Additionally, research on chemical communication, particularly pheromones, has elucidated how ants coordinate activities and make collective decisions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Ant Experience Model

The Ant Experience Model conceptualizes ant interactions with their environment akin to guest experiences in hospitality. This model posits that ants exhibit preferences and behaviors that can be analyzed through the lens of personalization and service quality. By understanding how ants "experience" their environment, we can draw parallels to human guest experiences.

#### Collective Service Quality

Collective Service Quality evaluates colony efficiency through the lens of service quality metrics. This construct allows for the assessment of how individual behaviors contribute to the overall performance of the colony, much like how service delivery impacts guest satisfaction in hospitality.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes principles from hospitality with social insect behaviors, highlighting key interactions and feedback loops. This model serves as a framework for analyzing the parallels between guest experience and ant behavior, providing a foundation for empirical research.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

The research design employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques to explore the intersection of both domains. This methodology enables a comprehensive analysis of ant behavior while incorporating insights from hospitality professionals.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection will involve observational studies of ant foraging behavior in natural settings. These observations will be complemented by surveys and interviews with hospitality professionals regarding guest experience metrics. The combination of these methods will provide a robust dataset for analysis.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis will be employed to examine ant behavior data, focusing on patterns of foraging and resource allocation. Thematic analysis will be utilized for qualitative data from hospitality surveys, identifying key themes and insights related to guest experiences.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount in this research. Observational studies will ensure humane treatment of insects, adhering to guidelines for responsible research. Additionally, ethical standards will be maintained when conducting research with human participants, ensuring informed consent and confidentiality.
