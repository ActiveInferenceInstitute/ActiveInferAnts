## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of cognitive security can be traced back to traditional cybersecurity, which primarily focused on protecting data and systems from unauthorized access and attacks. Cognitive security, however, extends this notion by emphasizing the safeguarding of cognitive processes, such as decision-making and belief formation, from manipulation and misinformation. This shift reflects a growing recognition of the psychological dimensions of security in an increasingly interconnected digital world.

Simultaneously, the spatial web has emerged as a transformative technological paradigm that blurs the lines between physical and digital experiences. The development of AR and VR technologies has enabled new forms of interaction, creating immersive environments where users can engage with digital content in novel ways. However, these advancements also introduce unique challenges, including the potential for cognitive overload and the risk of user manipulation through deceptive content.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current cognitive security frameworks emphasize the importance of information integrity and user awareness in mitigating cognitive threats. Researchers have identified various strategies to enhance cognitive resilience, including educational initiatives and technological interventions. However, the application of these principles within the context of the spatial web remains underexplored.

In the realm of the spatial web, challenges such as information overload, user manipulation, and the absence of established trust mechanisms are prevalent. Existing literature highlights the need for innovative solutions that address these issues, particularly as immersive technologies become more ubiquitous in everyday life. The intersection of cognitive security and the spatial web presents a fertile ground for research, offering opportunities to develop comprehensive frameworks that enhance user safety and trust.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the growing body of literature, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that combine cognitive security and spatial web technologies. This research seeks to fill this void by exploring the synergies between these domains and identifying opportunities for the development of new educational frameworks and technological solutions. By leveraging insights from both fields, this dissertation aims to create a holistic understanding of cognitive security in immersive environments.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive Load Theory posits that individuals have a limited capacity for processing information. In immersive environments, where users are bombarded with stimuli, understanding cognitive load is crucial for designing experiences that do not overwhelm users and facilitate effective information processing.

#### Information Integrity Theory
Information Integrity Theory focuses on the accuracy and reliability of information. In the context of the spatial web, ensuring that users can discern credible information from misinformation is paramount. This theory provides a framework for assessing the integrity of information presented in AR/VR environments.

#### User-Centered Design Principles
User-Centered Design (UCD) principles emphasize the importance of designing technologies with the user in mind. This approach is particularly relevant in the spatial web, where user experience plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of cognitive security measures.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Cognitive Resilience Theory in Spatial Environments
Cognitive Resilience Theory posits that individuals can develop the capacity to withstand cognitive threats through targeted training and education. This theory will be adapted to the spatial web context, exploring how immersive experiences can foster resilience against misinformation.

#### Dynamic Trust Models in Digital Interactions
Dynamic Trust Models account for the fluid nature of trust in digital interactions. In immersive environments, where users may encounter various sources of information, understanding how trust is established and maintained is essential for promoting user engagement and safety.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that illustrates the interaction between cognitive security principles and spatial web technologies. The model emphasizes the importance of user engagement, information integrity, and cognitive resilience, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding how these elements intersect to enhance user experiences in immersive environments.
