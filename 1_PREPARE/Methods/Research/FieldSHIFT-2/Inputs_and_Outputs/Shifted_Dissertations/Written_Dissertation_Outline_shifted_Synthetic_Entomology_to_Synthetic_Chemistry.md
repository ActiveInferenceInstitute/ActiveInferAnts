## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Theories of Adaptation and Evolution in Biology

The principles of adaptation and evolution serve as foundational theories in biology. The concept of natural selection, as articulated by Charles Darwin, underscores the importance of adaptability in organisms. Insects, with their rapid evolutionary responses to environmental pressures, exemplify the potential for adaptive strategies in catalysis. By understanding these biological theories, this dissertation will explore how they can inform the design of adaptive catalysts in chemical reactions.

#### Principles of Catalysis and Reaction Mechanisms in Chemistry

In chemistry, catalysis is governed by principles such as the transition state theory and enzyme kinetics. These theories elucidate the mechanisms by which catalysts enhance reaction rates and selectivity. By integrating these principles with biological concepts, this research seeks to develop a novel theoretical framework for adaptive catalysis that mirrors the dynamic nature of insect behavior.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
