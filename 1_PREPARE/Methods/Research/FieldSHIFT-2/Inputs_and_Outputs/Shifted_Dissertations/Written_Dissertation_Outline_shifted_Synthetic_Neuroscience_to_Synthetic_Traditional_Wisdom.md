## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Neuroscience, with its emphasis on the brain's structure and function, has traditionally been viewed as a purely scientific domain. The evolution of neuroscience has seen significant milestones, from early anatomical studies to the advent of neuroimaging techniques, which have allowed researchers to visualize brain activity in real-time. This scientific discipline has primarily focused on understanding cognitive processes, behavior, and the biological underpinnings of mental health.

In contrast, traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, focusing on sustainable living and ecological stewardship. These systems of knowledge are often transmitted orally and are deeply embedded in the cultural identity of communities. They encompass a range of practices, from agricultural techniques to medicinal uses of local flora, all of which have been developed and refined over generations.

This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by identifying parallels and integrating concepts from neuroscience into the framework of traditional knowledge. By doing so, it aims to reveal how the adaptive nature of traditional knowledge can be understood through the lens of neuroscience, particularly in terms of neural networks and cognitive processes.
