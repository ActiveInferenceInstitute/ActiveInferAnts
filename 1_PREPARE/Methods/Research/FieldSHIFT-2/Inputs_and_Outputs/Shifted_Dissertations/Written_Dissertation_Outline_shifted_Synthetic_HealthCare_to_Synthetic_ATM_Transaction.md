# Transforming ATM Transactions through Health Care Principles

## Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking framework that integrates principles from health care into the domain of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. By reimagining the ATM user experience through a patient-centered lens, the research aims to enhance user satisfaction, security, and accessibility. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize how financial institutions engage with customers, ultimately leading to a more equitable banking landscape. The dissertation will explore the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and interdisciplinary implications of this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The integration of health care principles into ATM transactions represents a novel approach to enhancing user experience in financial services. Traditionally, ATMs have focused on efficiency and security, often neglecting the emotional and psychological aspects of user interaction. The concept of patient-centered care in health care emphasizes understanding the individual needs and experiences of patients, which can be paralleled in the financial sector by focusing on user-centric design.

Historically, ATMs were developed primarily for transactional efficiencyâ€”allowing users to withdraw cash, check balances, and perform other banking functions with minimal human interaction. However, this transactional focus has often led to user frustration, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those unfamiliar with technology. By borrowing concepts from health care, such as personalized care and holistic support, this research seeks to address these shortcomings and create a more inclusive ATM experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms in both health care and banking. It highlights the importance of user experience in financial transactions and proposes a transformative model that prioritizes customer needs. The novelty lies in the systematic application of health care principles to a domain that has been largely overlooked in terms of user-centered design.

The implications of this research extend beyond the ATM interface itself; they encompass broader themes of financial literacy, accessibility, and the role of technology in fostering equitable access to financial services. By positioning user experience as a central tenet of ATM design, this dissertation aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how financial institutions can better serve their customers in an increasingly digital world.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation will address the following research questions:
1. How can health care principles be effectively transposed to enhance the ATM user experience?
2. What are the key factors influencing user satisfaction and security in ATM transactions?
3. How can the proposed model improve accessibility for diverse populations?
4. What interdisciplinary collaborations can be established to further this research?

The objectives of the research include:
- To identify and analyze the principles of patient-centered care that can be adapted to the ATM context.
- To evaluate the current state of ATM user experience and identify areas for improvement.
- To develop a framework that integrates health care principles into ATM design, focusing on user satisfaction, security, and accessibility.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care Principles

The evolution of health care principles, particularly the shift towards patient-centered care, has fundamentally transformed the way health services are delivered. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's experience, preferences, and needs in the provision of care. This approach has been linked to improved health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and enhanced adherence to treatment plans (McCormack et al., 2015).

Key elements of patient-centered care include effective communication, empathy, and the provision of holistic support. These principles can be translated into the financial domain by fostering a deeper understanding of customer experiences and addressing their emotional and psychological needs during financial transactions.

#### ATM Technology Development

The development of ATM technology has undergone significant changes since its inception in the late 1960s. Initially designed to automate simple banking transactions, ATMs have evolved into complex machines capable of performing a wide range of functions, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. However, despite advancements in technology, user experience has often been sidelined in favor of efficiency and security (Dahlberg et al., 2015).

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Advancements in Health Care User Experience

Recent advancements in health care regarding user experience have focused on integrating technology to enhance patient interactions. Telemedicine, mobile health applications, and patient portals are examples of how technology can improve access to care and facilitate communication between patients and providers (Bashshur et al., 2016). These innovations prioritize user engagement and satisfaction, providing valuable insights for the financial sector.

#### Current ATM Technologies

Current ATM technologies have seen improvements in security features, such as EMV chip technology and biometric authentication. However, many ATMs still lack user-friendly interfaces and personalized experiences. Research indicates that user satisfaction is often compromised by confusing interfaces, inadequate instructions, and a lack of emotional support during transactions (O'Neill & Kauffman, 2018). There is a pressing need for a paradigm shift towards user-centered design in ATM technology.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals significant gaps in user experience research within the ATM domain. While there is extensive research on service quality in banking, few studies have focused on the emotional and psychological aspects of ATM interactions. This presents an opportunity for innovation by applying health care principles to enhance user satisfaction and security.

The proposed Shifted Domain offers a unique framework for exploring how user-centered design can be integrated into ATM transactions. By leveraging insights from health care, this research aims to create a more equitable and inclusive banking experience for all users.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient Experience Theory

Patient Experience Theory posits that the quality of patient interactions with health care providers significantly influences health outcomes and satisfaction levels. Key dimensions of patient experience include communication, empathy, and the overall environment of care (Doyle et al., 2013). These dimensions can be adapted to the ATM context to enhance user interactions and satisfaction.

#### Service Quality Models

Service Quality Models, such as the SERVQUAL model, provide a framework for assessing service quality across various dimensions, including reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles (Parasuraman et al., 1988). These dimensions are applicable to both health care and ATM transactions, highlighting the importance of service quality in user satisfaction and loyalty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### User-Centric ATM Model

The User-Centric ATM Model prioritizes user experience in ATM interactions, emphasizing the need for personalization, emotional support, and accessibility. This model draws on principles from patient-centered care and service quality frameworks to create a holistic approach to ATM design.

#### The Healing ATM Concept

The Healing ATM Concept posits that user comfort can enhance financial literacy and access. By creating a supportive and empathetic environment, ATMs can foster trust and reduce user anxiety, ultimately leading to improved financial outcomes for users.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model combines health care principles with ATM transaction processes to improve user experience. This model incorporates elements of patient-centered care, service quality dimensions, and user-centric design principles to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing ATM interactions.
