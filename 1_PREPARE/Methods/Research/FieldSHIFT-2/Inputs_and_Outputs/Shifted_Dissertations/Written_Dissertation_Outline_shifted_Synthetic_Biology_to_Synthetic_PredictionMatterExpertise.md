# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Biology

Biology has undergone significant evolution since its inception, marked by key milestones such as Darwin's theory of evolution, which introduced the concept of natural selection, and the discovery of DNA, which revolutionized our understanding of genetics. These foundational principles have paved the way for contemporary trends such as conservation biology, which seeks to protect biodiversity, and synthetic biology, which aims to engineer biological systems for specific purposes. The historical context of biology reveals an ongoing quest to understand the complexities of life and the interdependencies among organisms, which is crucial for the integration of biological principles into predictive modeling.

### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

The field of PME has evolved alongside advancements in data science and technology, giving rise to sophisticated predictive analytics tools. However, PME faces challenges such as data overload and cognitive biases, which can hinder effective decision-making. The historical development of PME has been characterized by a focus on quantitative analysis and algorithmic predictions, often at the expense of qualitative insights that could enhance understanding. As the field matures, there is a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate diverse knowledge sources, including biological insights, to address these challenges.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Biology

Current trends in biology emphasize interdisciplinary approaches that integrate genomics, ecology, and evolutionary biology. The rise of systems biology, which examines the interactions within biological systems, exemplifies this trend. Researchers are increasingly recognizing that understanding complex biological phenomena requires a holistic perspective that considers the interplay of various factors, including environmental influences and genetic variability.

### PME

In PME, current methodologies prioritize analytical skills and cross-disciplinary synthesis. The emergence of big data analytics has transformed the landscape of predictive modeling, enabling the analysis of vast datasets to uncover patterns and inform decisions. However, many predictive models remain siloed within their respective domains, lacking the integrative frameworks necessary to enhance predictive accuracy. This gap presents a unique opportunity for the incorporation of biological principles into PME, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of predictive systems.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of biological insights into PME reveals significant gaps in existing predictive models that often overlook the complexities of biological interactions. For instance, traditional predictive models may fail to account for the adaptive behaviors of organisms in response to environmental changes. Conversely, the incorporation of biological principles can lead to innovative methodologies that enhance predictive accuracy and resilience. This Shifted Domain offers opportunities for the development of new frameworks that bridge the gap between biology and predictive modeling, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and advancing our understanding of complex systems.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical framework for this dissertation draws on foundational theories from both biology and PME. Ecological theories, such as the niche concept and food web dynamics, provide insights into the interactions among species and their environments. Additionally, population dynamics theories, including the logistic growth model and predator-prey interactions, offer valuable perspectives on how populations respond to changes in their ecosystems. Information theory, which examines the quantification and communication of information, serves as a critical underpinning for understanding the flow of knowledge within predictive networks.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

As the Shifted Domain evolves, new theoretical constructs emerge, including "knowledge biodiversity" and "predictive resilience." Knowledge biodiversity refers to the diversity of knowledge sources and perspectives that contribute to predictive modeling, emphasizing the importance of integrating diverse insights to enhance accuracy. Predictive resilience pertains to the ability of predictive models to adapt to changing conditions and uncertainties, drawing parallels to ecological resilience in biological systems. These constructs provide a foundation for the development of an integrated theoretical model that combines ecological frameworks with predictive methodologies.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the dynamic interactions between knowledge sources and decision-making processes. This model posits that the integration of biological principles into PME can enhance predictive accuracy by fostering knowledge biodiversity and promoting adaptive decision-making. By visualizing the relationships among various knowledge sources, the model underscores the importance of collaboration and information flow in improving predictive outcomes. This theoretical framework serves as a guiding structure for the empirical research conducted in this dissertation.
