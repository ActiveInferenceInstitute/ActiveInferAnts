# PhD Dissertation: Integrating Health Care and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between Health Care and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), aiming to redefine patient-centered care through adaptive systems thinking. By leveraging the FEP's insights into adaptive behavior, predictive coding, and active inference, this research seeks to enhance healthcare delivery, improve patient outcomes, and foster a more responsive healthcare environment. The potential impact of this work is profound, promising to innovate care practices, inform policy, and contribute to a new paradigm in health systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of Health Care and the Free Energy Principle offers a novel perspective on patient care, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between patients and their environments. This shift acknowledges the complexity of health systems and the necessity for adaptive strategies that account for individual patient experiences and needs. The FEP posits that biological systems operate to minimize free energy, which can be interpreted as a measure of surprise or prediction error. In healthcare, this translates to a model where patient experiences, expectations, and feedback are integral to the care process, allowing for a more tailored approach to treatment.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant in its potential to transform healthcare practices by applying principles of active inference and predictive coding to patient care. It offers a fresh lens through which to view healthcare interactions, moving beyond static models to embrace a more fluid, responsive approach. The integration of FEP into healthcare suggests that by understanding and anticipating patient needs, healthcare providers can enhance the quality of care, leading to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction. This novel approach not only addresses the limitations of traditional healthcare models but also aligns with the growing emphasis on personalized medicine.

By addressing these questions, this dissertation aims to contribute to the development of a more adaptive healthcare framework that prioritizes patient engagement and responsiveness.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of patient-centered care has been marked by significant milestones, including the shift from a paternalistic model to one that values patient autonomy and participation. Key developments include the introduction of the biopsychosocial model, which considers the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors in health, and the incorporation of technology in healthcare delivery. The rise of electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, and mobile health applications has further transformed the landscape, enabling more personalized and efficient care.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by researchers such as Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This theoretical framework has its roots in Bayesian inference, where organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world based on incoming sensory information. The FEP has been applied across various fields, including neuroscience, cognitive science, and robotics, but its implications for healthcare remain underexplored.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current healthcare practices often struggle to adapt to the nuanced needs of patients, leading to suboptimal outcomes and dissatisfaction. Traditional models frequently overlook the importance of patient feedback and the dynamic nature of health. Similarly, while advancements in FEP research have provided valuable insights into adaptive behavior, their application in healthcare settings has been limited. There is a pressing need for a framework that bridges these gaps, leveraging the strengths of both domains to create a more responsive healthcare system.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The disconnect between healthcare practices and adaptive systems theory presents both challenges and opportunities. Traditional healthcare models often fail to incorporate the principles of active inference and predictive coding, which could enhance patient engagement and outcomes. By integrating FEP concepts into healthcare frameworks, there is potential to develop innovative approaches that prioritize patient experience and responsiveness.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Theories of Patient Experience and Service Quality in Healthcare

Theories of patient experience emphasize the importance of understanding patient perspectives and expectations. Models such as the SERVQUAL framework highlight the dimensions of service quality, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions are critical for assessing patient satisfaction and informing care practices.

#### Theoretical Underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in Bayesian inference, which posits that organisms make predictions about their environment based on prior beliefs and update these predictions as new information becomes available. Active learning, a key component of the FEP, involves the process of seeking information to reduce uncertainty and improve predictive accuracy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Active Health Inference

Active Health Inference is a proposed construct that integrates the principles of active inference into patient care. This concept emphasizes the importance of patient engagement in the healthcare process, where patients actively participate in their care by providing feedback and adjusting their expectations based on their experiences.

#### Predictive Patient Experience

Predictive Patient Experience refers to the application of predictive coding in understanding and anticipating patient needs. By leveraging data on patient history, preferences, and behaviors, healthcare providers can tailor their approaches to enhance patient satisfaction and outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model is proposed that synthesizes elements from both healthcare and FEP. This model illustrates how adaptive systems can enhance patient care by incorporating feedback loops, predictive analytics, and active patient engagement. By prioritizing the dynamic interactions between patients and healthcare providers, this model aims to create a more responsive healthcare environment.
