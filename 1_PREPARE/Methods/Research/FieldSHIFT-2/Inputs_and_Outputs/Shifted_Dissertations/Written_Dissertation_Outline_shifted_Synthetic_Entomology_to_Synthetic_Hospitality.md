# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Insect Behavior and Ecology

Insect behavior and ecology have been subjects of extensive study, focusing on various aspects such as metamorphosis, specialization, social structures, and communication. Metamorphosis, which describes the transformation process from larva to adult, is not merely a biological phenomenon but a metaphorical lens through which we can understand change and development in hospitality contexts. Social insects like bees and ants exhibit remarkable specialization within their colonies, showcasing how division of labor can lead to increased efficiency and adaptability. These behaviors highlight the intricate balance of ecosystems, where insects play pivotal roles in pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling.

### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the years. Traditional theories of guest experience emphasize service quality, personalization, and the emotional connection between guests and service providers. However, the hospitality industry has faced persistent challenges, including service consistency, the integration of technology, and the need for sustainable practices. Understanding these historical challenges is crucial for identifying how principles from insect behavior can offer innovative solutions to enhance the guest experience.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Insect Studies

Recent advancements in understanding insect communication and social behavior have provided new insights into ecological roles and adaptations. Studies on pheromonal communication in social insects reveal intricate signaling mechanisms that facilitate cooperation and coordination. Furthermore, research into the ecological impact of insects has underscored their importance in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health. These findings can inform hospitality practices by emphasizing the significance of effective communication and collaboration among staff and guests.

### Guest Experience Research

Recent studies on personalization, technology in hospitality, and the impact of sustainability on guest satisfaction highlight the evolving nature of guest expectations. The rise of data-driven personalization has sparked debates surrounding data privacy and the ethics of using personal information to tailor experiences. This literature underscores the necessity for frameworks that prioritize guest preferences while respecting their privacy, aligning with entomological principles that emphasize communication and social structures.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both entomology and hospitality, there remains a conspicuous lack of interdisciplinary research bridging these fields. The opportunities for innovative service models inspired by biological principles are vast. By examining the behaviors of social insects and their implications for teamwork and communication, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and propose frameworks that address the evolving nature of guest interactions.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical underpinnings of this research draw from established theories in both entomology and hospitality management. Theories of metamorphosis in biology provide a foundational understanding of transformation and change, while the SERVQUAL model in hospitality offers insights into measuring service quality and guest satisfaction. These theories serve as the basis for developing new constructs that integrate biological insights into hospitality practices.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes two new theoretical constructs: 

1. **The Metamorphosis Model of Guest Experience**: This model draws parallels between the stages of metamorphosis in insects and the stages of the guest journey, emphasizing the importance of transformation at each phase of the guest experience.

2. **The Ecosystemic Guest Engagement Model**: This model highlights the interconnectedness of various elements within the hospitality ecosystem, including guests, staff, and technology, and how these elements interact to create a holistic guest experience.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The comprehensive model proposed in this dissertation combines principles of entomology with hospitality management to enhance guest experiences. By integrating insights from insect behavior—such as communication strategies, social structures, and adaptive behaviors—this model offers a framework for rethinking service delivery and guest interactions in hospitality settings.
