## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of entomology and guest experience represents a pioneering approach to understanding and enhancing the dynamics of hospitality. Entomology, the study of insects, offers insights into complex biological systems characterized by intricate behaviors and interactions. These insights can be translated into the hospitality context, where the emotional and experiential aspects of consumer interactions are paramount. The hospitality industry has increasingly recognized the importance of guest experience, evolving from mere service provision to a comprehensive focus on emotional engagement, personalization, and relationship-building.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant not only for its interdisciplinary approach but also for its potential to introduce biological insights into the largely anthropocentric field of hospitality. By leveraging entomological concepts, the dissertation aims to create a transformative framework that enhances guest interactions and operational efficiency. The novelty of this research lies in its ability to bridge two seemingly disparate fields, fostering a deeper understanding of how biological principles can inform human experiences and interactions.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Entomology

Entomology has evolved from its roots in natural history to a sophisticated scientific discipline that encompasses the study of insect biodiversity, ecology, and behavior. The historical development of entomology includes significant contributions from early naturalists who cataloged insect species and behaviors, leading to a greater understanding of ecological interactions and the importance of insects in various ecosystems. Today, entomology plays a critical role in addressing global challenges such as biodiversity loss, pest management, and environmental health.

#### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience has undergone a significant transformation over the past few decades. Initially focused on the basic provision of services, the hospitality industry has shifted towards a more holistic approach that prioritizes emotional engagement, personalization, and memorable interactions. This shift has been driven by changing consumer expectations, technological advancements, and increased competition within the industry. As a result, hospitality organizations are now tasked with creating unique and meaningful experiences that resonate with guests on a personal level.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Entomology

Current trends in entomology include the application of biotechnology, ecological modeling, and the study of insect behavior in relation to environmental changes. Researchers are exploring the potential of insects in areas such as pollination, waste decomposition, and as bioindicators of ecosystem health. The integration of technology, such as genetic sequencing and data analytics, has further advanced the field, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into insect populations and their ecological roles.

#### Guest Experience

In the realm of guest experience, the emphasis on data-driven personalization, technology integration, and service quality has become increasingly prominent. Hospitality organizations are leveraging data analytics to understand guest preferences, tailor services, and enhance overall satisfaction. The use of technology, including mobile applications and artificial intelligence, has transformed the way guests interact with hospitality providers, allowing for more efficient and personalized experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both entomology and guest experience, there remains a notable gap in the application of biological insights to enhance guest experiences. This research seeks to fill that gap by exploring isomorphisms between entomological principles and hospitality practices. By examining how the behaviors and social structures of insects can inform guest interactions and service delivery, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm for understanding and enhancing the guest experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Entomology Theories

Key theories from entomology that will inform this research include evolutionary biology, ecological interactions, and behavioral ecology. Evolutionary biology provides insights into how insects have adapted to their environments over time, while ecological interactions highlight the interdependence of species within ecosystems. Behavioral ecology examines the ways in which insects behave in response to environmental pressures, offering valuable lessons for understanding human behavior in hospitality contexts.

#### Guest Experience Theories

Theoretical frameworks from guest experience include service quality models, emotional engagement frameworks, and customer satisfaction theories. Service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL model, emphasize the importance of meeting and exceeding guest expectations. Emotional engagement frameworks focus on the emotional connections that guests form with hospitality providers, while customer satisfaction theories explore the factors that contribute to overall guest satisfaction.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Metamorphosis Framework

The metamorphosis framework views the guest journey as a transformative experience, akin to the life cycle of insects. This framework emphasizes the importance of each stage of the guest journey—pre-arrival, arrival, stay, and post-stay—and the emotional impacts associated with each stage. By understanding the transformative nature of the guest experience, hospitality providers can create more meaningful and memorable interactions.

#### Communication Strategies

Insect signaling methods, such as pheromone communication and visual displays, offer valuable insights into effective communication strategies within hospitality. This research proposes multi-modal communication approaches that draw on these insect-inspired techniques, enhancing the clarity, effectiveness, and emotional resonance of guest interactions.

#### Social Structures

The collaborative social structures observed in insect colonies, such as those of ants and bees, provide a model for fostering teamwork and cooperation within hospitality teams. By analyzing the behaviors and interactions within insect colonies, this research aims to identify strategies for enhancing service delivery through teamwork and collaboration.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will be proposed that synthesizes entomological principles with guest experience theories. This model will provide a comprehensive framework for enhancing hospitality practices, highlighting the interconnectedness of biological insights and human experiences. The model will emphasize adaptability, emotional engagement, and collaboration as key components of successful guest experiences.
