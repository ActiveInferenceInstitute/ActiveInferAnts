## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The study of entomology has evolved significantly over the centuries, transitioning from mere natural history to a complex discipline encompassing ecological and behavioral studies. Early entomologists focused on taxonomy and classification, while contemporary research delves into insect interactions within ecosystems, emphasizing their roles as pollinators, decomposers, and indicators of environmental health.

In parallel, the Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and information theory, positing that biological systems strive to minimize free energy, or surprise, through predictive coding. This framework has gained traction in cognitive science and neuroscience, providing insights into perception, action, and learning.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in entomology highlight the significance of insects in sustainable agriculture, bioremediation, and ecosystem services. Studies demonstrate how insects can be harnessed for pest control, pollination, and soil health, underscoring their ecological importance.

Conversely, the Free Energy Principle and active inference have been applied to various domains, including cognitive robotics and artificial intelligence. Researchers have explored how these principles can enhance machine learning algorithms, enabling systems to adapt to changing environments and minimize prediction errors.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich body of knowledge in both fields, there remain underexplored connections between insect behavior and active inference. This dissertation seeks to identify these gaps and leverage interdisciplinary research to develop innovative models and applications that enhance our understanding of adaptive systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories in entomology, such as ecological interactions and behavioral ecology, provide a foundation for understanding insect behavior. Behavioral ecology emphasizes the evolutionary significance of behavior in relation to environmental pressures, while ecological interactions highlight the interconnectedness of species within ecosystems.

The core concepts of the Free Energy Principle, including variational free energy and predictive coding, offer a robust framework for modeling adaptive behaviors. Variational free energy serves as a measure of surprise, guiding organisms in their interactions with the environment.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes the development of "Insective Models" as generative frameworks for understanding adaptive behaviors. These models draw parallels between insect behavior and active inference processes, providing a basis for predicting how organisms navigate complex environments.

Additionally, "Metamorphic Inference" is introduced as a process for model updating, wherein organisms adapt their internal models based on experiences during different life stages. This concept emphasizes the role of metamorphosis in refining predictive capabilities.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes insights from entomology and the Free Energy Principle, illustrating the parallels between insect behavior and adaptive inference processes. This model posits that insects, through their evolutionary adaptations, exemplify the principles of active inference, providing a blueprint for understanding more complex biological systems.

## Core Chapters

### Key Aspect 1: Insect Behavior as Active Inference

#### Sub-section 1: Foraging Strategies and Resource Prediction

Insects exhibit a range of foraging behaviors that reflect their ability to optimize resource acquisition. For example, honeybees utilize a sophisticated communication system through waggle dances to inform colony members about the location and quality of food sources. This behavior exemplifies predictive modeling, as bees adjust their foraging patterns based on environmental cues and previous experiences.

**Hypothesis:** Insects optimize foraging through predictive modeling of resource availability, minimizing surprise and maximizing energy efficiency.

#### Sub-section 2: Experimental Design

Proposed experiments will involve controlled environments where variables such as resource distribution and environmental conditions can be manipulated. Behavioral responses will be recorded, and statistical analyses will be conducted to test the hypothesis regarding predictive modeling in foraging behavior.

### Key Aspect 2: Metamorphosis as Adaptive Model Updating

#### Sub-section 1: Life Cycle Stages and Environmental Adaptation

Metamorphosis in insects, such as butterflies and beetles, represents a critical phase of development where significant morphological and behavioral changes occur. Each metamorphic stage can be viewed as an opportunity for model updating, where the organism refines its internal representation of environmental interactions.

**Hypothesis:** Each metamorphic stage represents a refined model of environmental interactions, enhancing the organism's adaptive capabilities.

#### Sub-section 2: Case Studies
