# PhD Dissertation: Insect Adaptations and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the intersection of insect biology and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), providing a novel framework for understanding adaptive systems. By examining how insects minimize free energy through their behaviors, metamorphosis, and social structures, this research aims to generate insights applicable to cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and ecological sustainability. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both theoretical understanding and practical applications in diverse fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of entomology and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability. Insects, with their remarkable adaptations and complex social behaviors, provide rich examples for exploring the principles of FEP. The FEP, rooted in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, offers a theoretical framework that emphasizes the importance of prediction and adaptation in biological systems. Insects, as a diverse and ecologically significant group, exemplify the principles of adaptation, making them ideal subjects for this investigation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to illuminate the mechanisms of adaptation and decision-making in both biological and artificial systems. By applying insights from insect biology to the FEP, we can develop a more integrated understanding of how organisms navigate their environments. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging entomology and cognitive science to inform the design of intelligent systems. The implications extend beyond academia, potentially influencing industries reliant on adaptive algorithms and ecological conservation strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. **How do insect adaptations exemplify the principles of free energy minimization?**
2. **In what ways can the metamorphic processes of insects inform dynamic model updating in cognitive systems?**
3. **How do social behaviors in insect colonies illustrate collective active inference and decision-making?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of entomology has been marked by significant discoveries, including the classification of insect species, the understanding of their life cycles, and the intricacies of their behaviors. Pioneers like Karl von Frisch and Edward O. Wilson have contributed to our understanding of insect communication and social structures. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle has its roots in the works of Helmholtz and later developments in cognitive science, particularly in predictive coding frameworks that describe how organisms generate predictions about their environment and update their beliefs based on sensory inputs.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in insect adaptations focuses on various aspects, including camouflage, mimicry, and social behaviors. Insects like the stick insect demonstrate remarkable camouflage, while social insects such as ants and bees exhibit complex communication systems. Conversely, the FEP has gained traction in cognitive science, robotics, and AI, providing a framework for understanding how systems minimize uncertainty and optimize behavior. However, the integration of insect biology into FEP remains underexplored, highlighting a significant gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of biological insights into cognitive models presents opportunities for interdisciplinary research that bridges entomology and FEP. Current models often overlook the dynamic nature of insect behaviors and their implications for understanding adaptive systems. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a framework that synthesizes knowledge from both domains, ultimately enhancing our understanding of adaptation and decision-making.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

**Adaptation Theory in Evolutionary Biology**: Adaptation theory posits that organisms evolve traits that enhance their survival and reproductive success in specific environments. This theory provides a foundational understanding of how insects have developed diverse adaptations to thrive in varying ecological niches.

**Predictive Coding Frameworks in Cognitive Science**: Predictive coding suggests that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on incoming information. This framework has implications for understanding how organisms, including insects, process information and make decisions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

**Insective Inference as a Model for Adaptive Behavior**: This construct proposes that insect behaviors can be understood as a form of inference, where insects make predictions about their environment and adjust their actions accordingly. This model emphasizes the role of sensory input and environmental feedback in shaping adaptive behaviors.

**Metamorphic Updating as a Framework for Dynamic Learning**: This framework posits that the metamorphic stages of insects represent dynamic updates to their generative models, allowing them to adapt to new environments and challenges. This concept can inform our understanding of learning processes in both biological and artificial systems.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes insect adaptations with the principles of FEP, emphasizing the importance of prediction, adaptation, and dynamic learning. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the research questions outlined in this dissertation and guides the development of empirical investigations.
