# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### ATM Transactions

The evolution of ATM transactions from traditional banking to automated self-service banking has been marked by significant advancements in user experience, security, and efficiency. ATMs have transformed the way individuals interact with financial institutions, providing immediate access to cash and financial services. The design of ATMs prioritizes user experience through intuitive interfaces, accessibility features, and security measures such as PIN authentication and transaction encryption. These advancements have not only improved user satisfaction but have also reduced the risk of fraud and unauthorized access.

### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has emerged as a response to the rise of digital misinformation and the need for protecting cognitive processes from manipulation. The proliferation of social media and online platforms has facilitated the rapid spread of false information, leading to cognitive biases and misinformed decision-making. Cognitive security aims to address these challenges by developing frameworks that enhance information verification and promote critical thinking. Research in this field has focused on understanding the psychological aspects of information processing and the impact of misinformation on public perception.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### ATM Transactions

The current state of knowledge in ATM transactions includes established best practices in user interface design, transaction security, and interoperability. Research has demonstrated the importance of usability and accessibility in ATM design, with a focus on minimizing user errors and enhancing transaction efficiency. Additionally, advancements in security protocols, such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification, have further strengthened the integrity of ATM transactions.

### Cognitive Security

The field of cognitive security has seen a growing body of research addressing misinformation, cognitive biases, and the psychological aspects of information processing. Scholars have explored various strategies for combating misinformation, including fact-checking initiatives, media literacy programs, and the development of cognitive security tools. However, there remains a gap in the integration of transactional principles from the ATM domain into cognitive security frameworks, which this research aims to address.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain reveals a lack of frameworks that integrate transactional principles into cognitive security. While there has been significant progress in both fields, the absence of user-friendly tools that facilitate information verification represents a critical opportunity for innovation. By applying the principles of user-centric design and structured information flows from ATM transactions to cognitive security, this research aims to fill this gap and enhance public resilience against misinformation.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

User Experience (UX) Theory emphasizes the importance of usability and accessibility in design. In the context of ATM transactions, principles of UX design focus on creating intuitive interfaces that enhance user satisfaction and minimize errors. This theory provides a foundation for understanding how user-centric design can be applied to cognitive security, ensuring that information verification processes are accessible and engaging for users.

### Information Integrity Theory

Information Integrity Theory addresses the authenticity and reliability of information in cognitive security. This framework emphasizes the need for robust verification processes to ensure that information is accurate and trustworthy. By integrating this theory with principles from ATM transactions, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework for enhancing cognitive security.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Cognitive Transaction Theory

Cognitive Transaction Theory emerges as a new theoretical construct that merges transaction principles with cognitive security. This theory emphasizes structured verification processes that mirror the transaction flows in ATM systems, providing a systematic approach to information verification. By leveraging the strengths of both domains, Cognitive Transaction Theory aims to enhance user engagement and trust in cognitive security practices.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model outlines the relationship between user-centric design, structured information flows, and cognitive resilience. This model illustrates how these components interact to enhance cognitive security, ultimately fostering a culture of critical thinking and responsible information sharing. By applying this model, researchers and practitioners can develop tools and frameworks that effectively combat misinformation and promote user engagement.
