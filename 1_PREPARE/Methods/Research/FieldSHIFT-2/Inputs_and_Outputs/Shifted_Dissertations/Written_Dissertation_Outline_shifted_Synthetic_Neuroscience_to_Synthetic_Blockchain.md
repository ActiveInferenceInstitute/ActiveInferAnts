# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved from anatomical studies to a multidisciplinary field that combines biology, psychology, and computational science. Key developments include the discovery of neural plasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This adaptability is crucial for learning and memory and has inspired machine learning techniques to model brain functions, leading to advancements in artificial intelligence.

### Blockchain

Blockchain technology originated with Bitcoin in 2009, addressing trust issues in digital transactions through a decentralized ledger system. Its evolution has led to applications in smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and supply chain management. However, Blockchain faces challenges in scalability and energy efficiency, particularly as networks grow and transaction volumes increase. The need for innovative solutions that enhance these aspects is more pressing than ever.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in Neuroscience emphasize understanding neural circuits, brain-computer interfaces, and the implications of neural plasticity for learning and adaptability. In contrast, Blockchain research is increasingly focused on interoperability, privacy solutions, and governance mechanisms. However, there is a notable gap in integrating insights from Neuroscience into Blockchain frameworks, which this dissertation aims to address.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of adaptive mechanisms in Blockchain presents an opportunity to apply insights from Neuroscience, particularly in creating systems that can learn and evolve. By leveraging concepts such as neural feedback loops and synaptic plasticity, researchers can develop more robust and efficient decentralized networks. This integration not only enhances the functionality of Blockchain but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Neural Networks Theory:** This theory focuses on the interconnectedness of neurons and the processing of information through synaptic connections. It posits that learning occurs through the strengthening or weakening of these connections based on experience and environmental stimuli.
  
- **Blockchain Theory:** This theory centers on decentralized ledgers and consensus mechanisms that ensure secure and transparent transactions. It emphasizes the importance of trust, collaboration, and validation among network participants.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Adaptive Consensus Theory:** This proposed theory suggests that consensus mechanisms can evolve based on network activity, similar to synaptic plasticity in biological systems. By incorporating feedback loops, Blockchain networks can adapt to changing conditions and user behaviors.

- **Neuro-Inspired Tokenomics:** This construct suggests that token systems can be designed to facilitate communication and resource allocation akin to neurotransmitter functions in the brain. By mimicking these biological processes, tokenomics can become more dynamic and responsive to network needs.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines neural network principles with Blockchain structures is proposed, emphasizing adaptability, learning, and decentralized decision-making. This model aims to create a framework where Blockchain systems can evolve over time, improving their efficiency and effectiveness in response to real-world challenges.
