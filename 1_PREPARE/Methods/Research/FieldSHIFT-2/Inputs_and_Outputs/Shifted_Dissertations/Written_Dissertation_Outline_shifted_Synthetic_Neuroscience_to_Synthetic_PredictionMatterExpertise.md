## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of Neural Networks
Neural networks have their origins in the early work of neurophysiologists and mathematicians who sought to model the brain's functioning. Pioneering models, such as the Perceptron introduced by Rosenblatt (1958), laid the groundwork for contemporary neural networks. Over the decades, advancements in algorithms, computational power, and data availability have led to the development of deep learning architectures, which have revolutionized applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

#### Evolution of Prediction Matter Expertise
Prediction matter expertise has evolved from traditional decision-making frameworks to encompass a more interdisciplinary approach. Key contributions from cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and data science have shaped the understanding of how individuals and organizations make predictions. Historical milestones, such as Kahneman and Tversky's work on cognitive biases, highlight the complexities involved in human prediction processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Review of Recent Advancements in Neural Network Technologies
Recent advancements in neural network technologies, particularly in deep learning, have led to significant improvements in predictive accuracy. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have enabled breakthroughs in tasks requiring complex pattern recognition and sequential data analysis. However, challenges remain, particularly in the areas of interpretability and generalization.

#### Examination of Current Methodologies in PME and Their Limitations
Current methodologies in PME often rely on traditional statistical models and heuristics, which may not fully capture the complexities of modern decision-making contexts. Limitations include a lack of adaptability to dynamic environments and insufficient integration of interdisciplinary knowledge. This highlights the need for innovative approaches that can enhance predictive capabilities.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
#### Identification of Gaps
The intersection of neural networks and PME presents several gaps in the literature. While neural networks have been extensively studied in isolation, their principles have not been systematically applied to enhance PME. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring how neural network concepts can inform the development of adaptive prediction models.

#### Exploration of Interdisciplinary Opportunities
Opportunities for interdisciplinary research abound, particularly in leveraging insights from cognitive neuroscience to inform predictive analytics. By fostering collaboration between fields such as artificial intelligence, psychology, and decision science, this research can lead to innovative solutions that address complex prediction challenges.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Overview of Key Theories in Neural Networks
Key theories in neural networks include Hebbian learning, which posits that synaptic strength increases when neurons are activated simultaneously, and backpropagation, a supervised learning algorithm that adjusts weights to minimize prediction error. These theories provide the foundational mechanisms for how neural networks learn from data.

#### Examination of Theories in PME
In PME, theories such as cognitive load theory and decision-making frameworks (e.g., the dual-process theory) offer insights into how individuals process information and make predictions. Cognitive load theory emphasizes the limitations of working memory, while dual-process theory distinguishes between intuitive and analytical thinking processes.
