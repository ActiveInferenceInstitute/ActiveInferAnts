# PhD Dissertation: Transforming Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) through Health Care Principles

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating patient-centered care principles from healthcare into the field of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By establishing a framework that prioritizes user experience, quality metrics, and technology-driven solutions, this research will address critical gaps in PME, enhancing its relevance and applicability across various domains. The anticipated impact includes improved predictive accuracy, user satisfaction, and the establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare and data science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of healthcare principles with PME represents a significant paradigm shift. Traditionally, healthcare has focused on patient-centered practices, emphasizing quality, technology integration, and sustainability. The Institute of Medicine (2001) defines patient-centered care as "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values." This approach has led to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction metrics. Conversely, PME has largely been data-driven, often neglecting user experience and emotional insights. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, creating a novel approach to predictions that is both user-focused and data-informed.

The integration of healthcare principles into PME can foster a more holistic understanding of user needs and experiences. By adopting a patient-centric model, predictive analytics can evolve from mere statistical outputs to tools that genuinely resonate with and serve users' interests. This shift is not merely academic; it has practical implications for various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and technology, where predictions often dictate critical decisions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it reimagines PME through the lens of healthcare principles, providing a framework that enhances predictive capabilities while prioritizing user needs. The novelty lies in the introduction of concepts such as "Patient-Centric Predictions" and "Quality Prediction Metrics," which will revolutionize how predictions are made and evaluated. The potential for interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare providers and data scientists could lead to innovative predictive models that are not only technically sound but also empathetic and user-friendly.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of patient-centered care enhance the accuracy and applicability of predictions in PME?
2. What quality metrics can be established to measure the effectiveness of predictive models?
3. How can technology facilitate the integration of user feedback into predictive processes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of healthcare has increasingly shifted towards patient-centered care, which emphasizes the importance of understanding and integrating patient experiences into treatment plans. Research has shown that patient-centered practices lead to better health outcomes and increased patient satisfaction (Bodenheimer & Berry-Millett, 2009). The incorporation of technology in healthcare, such as electronic health records and telemedicine, has further enhanced the ability to provide personalized care.

#### Prediction Matter Expertise

PME has traditionally relied on data-driven methodologies, focusing on statistical accuracy and algorithmic efficiency. However, these approaches often overlook the qualitative aspects of user experience and emotional insights, leading to a disconnect between predictive outputs and user needs. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and overfitting, can distort the predictive process, resulting in models that fail to resonate with users.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature highlights a growing recognition of the importance of user experience in both healthcare and predictive analytics. In healthcare, studies emphasize the role of patient engagement and satisfaction in improving health outcomes (Hibbard & Greene, 2013). In PME, there is an increasing acknowledgment of the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches and the need for more holistic models that incorporate user feedback.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps remain. There is a lack of user-centered approaches in PME, which often leads to models that do not adequately address the needs and preferences of users. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration, where healthcare principles can inform and enhance predictive modeling practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient-Centered Care Theory

Patient-centered care theory emphasizes the importance of understanding patient needs and experiences. This framework advocates for a healthcare approach that prioritizes the patient's perspective, allowing for more tailored and satisfactory care experiences.

#### Predictive Analytics Theory

Predictive analytics theory focuses on data-driven decision-making processes. It encompasses various statistical and machine learning methodologies aimed at forecasting outcomes based on historical data. However, traditional predictive analytics often lacks the nuance required to address user-specific needs.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Empathy-Driven Prediction Model

The empathy-driven prediction model is a new theoretical construct that integrates emotional insights into predictive modeling. This model recognizes that user emotions and experiences are critical components in shaping predictive outcomes and seeks to incorporate these factors into the predictive process.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines patient-centered principles with predictive analytics, fostering a holistic approach to predictions. This model emphasizes the importance of user feedback, quality metrics, and technology integration, creating a comprehensive framework for enhancing PME.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This research will adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of healthcare principles into PME. This design allows for a comprehensive understanding of the research questions by capturing both numerical data and rich, contextual insights.

### Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with healthcare professionals and predictive analysts. Surveys will assess perceptions of user-centered practices in predictive modeling, while interviews will provide in-depth insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating healthcare principles into PME. Additionally, case studies of existing predictive models that incorporate user feedback will be analyzed to identify best practices.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis of survey data will identify correlations between user-centered practices and predictive accuracy. Techniques such as regression analysis and factor analysis will be employed to assess the impact of various factors on predictive outcomes. Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews will uncover common themes and insights related to the integration of healthcare principles into PME.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring they are aware of their rights and the purpose of the study. Confidentiality and data protection standards will be strictly adhered to, safeguarding participant information.
