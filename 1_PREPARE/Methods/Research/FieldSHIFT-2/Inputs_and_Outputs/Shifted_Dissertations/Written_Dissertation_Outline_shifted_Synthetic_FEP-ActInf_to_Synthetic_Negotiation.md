## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle, a concept rooted in theoretical biology and cognitive neuroscience, posits that adaptive systems, including biological entities, strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity and functionality (Friston, 2010). This principle elucidates how organisms, including humans, continuously update their beliefs and actions based on incoming sensory information to reduce discrepancies between their expectations and reality. Negotiation, defined as a process of dialogue aimed at reaching agreements, can be viewed through this lens, revealing underlying cognitive and strategic mechanisms that guide negotiators in their interactions. By framing negotiation as an adaptive process, we can explore how individuals navigate complex social environments, manage uncertainty, and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research stands at the forefront of an emerging interdisciplinary field that merges cognitive science with negotiation. Traditionally, negotiation has been studied within the confines of social psychology, economics, and organizational behavior. However, by framing negotiation as a dynamic system governed by principles of active inference and generative modeling, we unlock new pathways for understanding and improving negotiation practices. The novel application of the FEP to negotiation dynamics not only provides a fresh perspective on existing theories but also offers practical implications for training, practice, and technology in negotiation contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance negotiation strategies?
2. In what ways do cognitive biases function as prediction errors in negotiation contexts?
3. How do cultural differences in negotiation styles reflect various strategies for minimizing variational free energy?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in statistical mechanics and has been adapted to explain a wide range of phenomena in cognitive science and neuroscience. Originating from the work of Helmholtz and later developed by Friston (2010), the FEP posits that biological systems are driven by the imperative to minimize free energyâ€”a measure of surprise or prediction error. This principle has been foundational in understanding how organisms adapt to their environments, integrating sensory input with prior beliefs to optimize behavior.

#### Negotiation

Negotiation theory has evolved significantly over the past century, reflecting shifts in economic, psychological, and social paradigms. Early models, such as the distributive bargaining approach, emphasized competitive strategies aimed at maximizing individual gains (Fisher & Ury, 1981). In contrast, integrative negotiation models advocate for collaborative approaches that seek mutual benefit and value creation (Raiffa, 1982). The development of negotiation frameworks has been influenced by game theory, behavioral economics, and social psychology, each contributing to a nuanced understanding of negotiation dynamics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Free Energy Principle

Contemporary research on the FEP has expanded its applications beyond biology to encompass cognitive processes, social interactions, and even artificial intelligence (Clark, 2013). Studies have demonstrated how the FEP can explain various cognitive phenomena, including perception, action, and decision-making, by framing them as processes of predictive coding and active inference.

#### Negotiation Theories

Current literature in negotiation focuses on various aspects, including the role of emotions, cognitive biases, and cultural differences in shaping negotiation outcomes (Thompson, 2009). However, a comprehensive framework that integrates these diverse elements through the lens of the FEP remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich theoretical landscape in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate cognitive science with negotiation theory. This research aims to address this gap by exploring how the principles of the FEP can illuminate the cognitive processes underlying negotiation dynamics. The potential for innovative research that addresses these gaps is significant, paving the way for new methodologies and applications in both cognitive science and negotiation practice.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Active Inference

Active inference posits that agents actively seek to minimize prediction errors through their actions, thereby updating their beliefs about the world (Friston, 2010). In negotiation, this concept can be applied to understand how negotiators adjust their strategies based on feedback from their counterparts.

#### Generative Models

Generative models refer to probabilistic frameworks that allow agents to infer the underlying causes of observed data (Bishop, 2006). In the context of negotiation, generative models can help negotiators formulate expectations about the interests and behaviors of their counterparts, guiding their strategic decisions.

#### Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy serves as a measure of the discrepancy between an agent's beliefs and the actual state of the world. In negotiation, minimizing variational free energy involves aligning one's strategies with the evolving dynamics of the negotiation process.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Negotiation as an Adaptive System

Framing negotiation as an adaptive system emphasizes the dynamic interplay between negotiators as they respond to each other's actions and feedback. This perspective highlights the importance of flexibility and adaptability in achieving successful negotiation outcomes.

#### Cognitive Biases as Prediction Errors

Cognitive biases can be understood as systematic deviations from rational decision-making that arise from prediction errors. In negotiation contexts, these biases can distort negotiators' perceptions and judgments, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

#### Cultural Differences as Variational Free Energy Strategies

Cultural differences in negotiation styles can be interpreted as varying strategies for minimizing variational free energy. Understanding these differences can enhance cross-cultural negotiations and facilitate more effective communication and collaboration.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated model illustrating the parallels between the FEP and negotiation. The model emphasizes the adaptive nature of negotiation strategies, highlighting how negotiators can leverage active inference, generative models, and variational free energy principles to enhance their outcomes.
