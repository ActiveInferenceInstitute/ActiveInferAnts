## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has a rich history that spans centuries, characterized by significant artistic movements and technological advancements. From the intricate weavings of ancient civilizations to the industrial revolution's mass production techniques, the evolution of fabric design reflects broader societal changes. Key movements, such as the Arts and Crafts Movement in the late 19th century, emphasized the importance of craftsmanship and the value of handmade goods. This historical context provides a foundation for understanding the contemporary significance of craftsmanship in fabric design.

#### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the years. Early paradigms focused primarily on service quality and operational efficiency. However, with the rise of experiential travel and personalized services, the definition of guest experience has expanded to include emotional connections, cultural immersion, and sustainability. This evolution reflects a broader shift towards valuing the guest's personal journey, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to enhance service delivery.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Fabric Industry

Contemporary trends in the fabric industry emphasize sustainability, digital innovations, and a return to craftsmanship. Sustainable practices, such as eco-friendly materials and ethical production methods, are increasingly prioritized as consumers become more environmentally conscious. Additionally, the rise of digital technologies has transformed fabric design and production processes, enabling greater customization and personalization.

#### Guest Experience

Current research on guest satisfaction emphasizes the importance of personalization, cultural experiences, and the integration of technology. Studies suggest that guests increasingly seek authentic experiences that resonate with their values and preferences. The impact of technology on guest interactions, from mobile check-ins to personalized recommendations, is also a critical area of focus in contemporary hospitality research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in the literature regarding the integration of fabric arts into the hospitality sector. This research identifies opportunities for enhancing guest experiences through the application of craftsmanship, cultural storytelling, and sustainable practices from the fabric industry. By bridging this gap, the dissertation aims to contribute to both fields and promote interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Artistic Expression Theory

Artistic Expression Theory posits that various forms of art, including textiles, serve as mediums for cultural narratives and emotional connections. This theory emphasizes the importance of craftsmanship and the stories embedded in fabric design, providing a framework for understanding how textiles can enhance guest experiences in hospitality.

#### Service Quality Theory

Service Quality Theory examines the dimensions of service quality, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. This framework is essential for evaluating how the integration of fabric arts can influence service delivery and guest satisfaction in hospitality settings.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Experience Fabrication

Experience Fabrication is a novel concept that intertwines the artistry of fabric design with the creation of tailored guest experiences. This construct emphasizes the role of textiles as a medium for crafting memorable interactions, fostering emotional connections between guests and their surroundings.

#### Cultural Weaving

Cultural Weaving refers to the integration of local narratives and cultural elements into guest experiences. This construct highlights the importance of authenticity and cultural representation in hospitality, advocating for the incorporation of local textile arts to enrich guest interactions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interconnectedness of craftsmanship, cultural expression, and sustainability in enhancing guest experiences. This model serves as a guiding framework for the research, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative practices in both the fabric industry and hospitality.
