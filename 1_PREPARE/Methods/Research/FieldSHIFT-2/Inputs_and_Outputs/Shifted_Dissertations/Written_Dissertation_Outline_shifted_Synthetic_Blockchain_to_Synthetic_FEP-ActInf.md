# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between blockchain technology, characterized by decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms, and the Free Energy Principle, which seeks to explain how biological systems minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis. Blockchain technology, initially developed to facilitate secure transactions in cryptocurrencies, has evolved into a robust framework for decentralized applications. Its core principles—decentralization, immutability, and transparency—enable entities to operate without a central authority, fostering trust through cryptographic means.

In parallel, the Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a measure of surprise or uncertainty in their environment. This principle underlies various cognitive and biological processes, suggesting that organisms engage in active inference, continuously updating their internal models to better predict and respond to environmental changes. The fusion of these two domains creates a unique landscape for exploring how decentralized networks can enhance adaptive behaviors in complex systems, offering insights into both natural and artificial intelligence.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between technology and cognitive science. It introduces novel theoretical constructs, such as Decentralized Adaptive Systems and Consensus Learning Mechanisms, which can transform our understanding of both fields. By synthesizing principles from blockchain and the Free Energy Principle, this work provides a fresh perspective on how decentralized systems can operate efficiently in uncertain environments. The implications extend beyond theoretical frameworks; they encompass practical applications in artificial intelligence, ecological management, and decision-making processes.

The novelty of this research lies in its potential to redefine the operational paradigms of adaptive systems. By leveraging blockchain technologies, adaptive systems can achieve greater resilience, transparency, and efficiency. This research is poised to contribute significantly to the development of systems that can better navigate complexities and uncertainties inherent in both natural and artificial environments.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of decentralization from blockchain enhance the efficiency of adaptive systems?

The overarching objective of this dissertation is to elucidate the synergies between blockchain technology and the Free Energy Principle, ultimately proposing a framework for Decentralized Adaptive Systems that enhances decision-making processes in both biological and artificial contexts.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Blockchain

The development of blockchain technology began with the introduction of Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, which presented a decentralized digital currency. Key milestones in the evolution of blockchain include the introduction of Ethereum in 2015, which expanded blockchain's utility beyond cryptocurrencies to smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). The principles of decentralization, immutability, and transparency are foundational to blockchain, enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. 

Decentralization refers to the distribution of control and decision-making across a network, reducing the risk of single points of failure. Immutability ensures that once data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered retroactively, fostering trust among participants. Transparency allows all participants to verify transactions, enhancing accountability and reducing fraud.

### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems minimize surprise through a process of active inference. This principle is grounded in statistical mechanics and Bayesian inference, suggesting that organisms continuously update their internal models to predict sensory inputs and minimize the discrepancy between expected and actual outcomes. Key concepts include variational free energy, which quantifies the uncertainty in a system, and predictive coding, which describes how the brain encodes information based on predictions.

Historically, the Free Energy Principle has provided a unifying framework for understanding various cognitive and biological phenomena, including perception, action, and learning. It has implications for understanding how organisms adapt to their environments, emphasizing the role of prediction and error correction in maintaining homeostasis.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in blockchain technology include scalability solutions such as sharding and layer-two protocols, which aim to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latency. Additionally, improvements in cryptographic security measures have bolstered the integrity of blockchain networks, addressing concerns related to vulnerabilities and attacks.

In the realm of the Free Energy Principle, current research has expanded its applications to complex adaptive systems, including social systems and artificial intelligence. Studies have demonstrated how predictive coding can inform machine learning algorithms, enabling models to adapt based on incoming data. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive literature exploring the integration of blockchain principles within the framework of the Free Energy Principle.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both blockchain and the Free Energy Principle, there are notable gaps in the literature regarding the integration of these domains. Specifically, the application of decentralized principles to enhance adaptive behaviors in complex systems remains underexplored. Opportunities for innovative research are abundant, particularly in developing frameworks that leverage blockchain's decentralized nature to improve decision-making processes in adaptive systems.

This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by proposing a novel paradigm—Decentralized Adaptive Systems—where insights from both fields converge to create a robust framework for understanding and enhancing adaptive behaviors in uncertain environments.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Blockchain

Key theories from blockchain include consensus protocols, which are mechanisms that enable participants in a decentralized network to agree on the state of the system. Prominent consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Each mechanism has implications for the efficiency, security, and scalability of blockchain networks.

### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle provides a theoretical foundation for understanding adaptive behaviors in biological systems. Variational free energy serves as a measure of surprise, guiding organisms in their interactions with the environment. Active inference is the process through which agents update their beliefs and actions based on sensory input, striving to minimize free energy.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research introduces two new theoretical constructs: Decentralized Adaptive Systems and Consensus Learning Mechanisms. Decentralized Adaptive Systems (DAS) encompass frameworks that integrate decentralized principles from blockchain with adaptive behaviors informed by the Free Energy Principle. Consensus Learning Mechanisms refer to the processes by which decentralized agents collaboratively update their models and share information, enhancing collective decision-making.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interaction between decentralized networks and adaptive systems. It posits that decentralized networks can enhance the efficiency of adaptive systems by facilitating information sharing, model updating, and collaborative learning. The model emphasizes the importance of consensus mechanisms in enabling agents to align their beliefs and actions, ultimately leading to improved decision-making processes.
