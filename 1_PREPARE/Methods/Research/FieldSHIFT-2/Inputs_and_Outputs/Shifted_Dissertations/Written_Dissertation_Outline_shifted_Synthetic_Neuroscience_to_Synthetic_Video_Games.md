## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved significantly since its inception, marked by key milestones such as the discovery of the neuron by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in the late 19th century, the development of neuroimaging techniques in the 20th century, and the advent of neuroplasticity research in the 21st century. These advancements have led to a deeper understanding of how the brain processes information, learns, and adapts to new experiences.

#### Historical Development of Game Design

Game design has also undergone a remarkable transformation, from early arcade games in the 1970s to the complex narratives and immersive worlds of contemporary video games. The evolution of technology has allowed for richer storytelling, intricate mechanics, and expansive game worlds, creating a diverse landscape of gaming experiences that cater to a wide range of player preferences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Key Findings in Neuroscience

Recent findings in neuroscience have illuminated the mechanisms of learning and memory, emphasizing the role of synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in cognitive development. Studies have shown that emotional engagement is closely linked to memory retention, suggesting that experiences that elicit strong emotional responses are more likely to be remembered.

#### Contemporary Game Design Practices

Contemporary game design practices prioritize player experience, focusing on engagement, immersion, and emotional connection. Designers leverage mechanics such as feedback loops, rewards systems, and narrative structures to create compelling gameplay experiences that resonate with players on multiple levels.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both fields, there remain significant gaps in current game design that could benefit from neuroscientific insights. For instance, many games fail to adapt to individual player needs, leading to disengagement or frustration. Additionally, the potential for new methodologies that combine scientific research with creative design remains largely unexplored, presenting an opportunity for innovation in game development.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in Neuroscience

Foundational theories in neuroscience, such as synaptic plasticity and neural networks, provide a basis for understanding how experiences shape cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, influencing learning and memory. Neural network models further illustrate how interconnected neurons process information, providing insights into learning mechanisms.

#### Established Game Design Theories

Established theories in game design, such as flow theory and player engagement models, highlight the importance of creating experiences that challenge players while providing a sense of accomplishment. Flow theory, introduced by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, posits that players achieve optimal engagement when the challenges of a game are balanced with their skill level.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of a Framework Connecting Neuroscience and Game Design

This dissertation proposes a framework that connects neuroscience principles to game design mechanics, emphasizing the importance of adaptive systems that respond to player behavior and emotional states. Concepts such as neuro-gaming and plastic mechanics will be introduced, illustrating how games can be designed to promote cognitive and emotional development through targeted engagement strategies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model presented in this dissertation will illustrate the relationship between neuroscience and game design, highlighting feedback loops and adaptive systems. This model will serve as a foundation for understanding how game mechanics can be informed by neuroscientific principles to create more engaging and meaningful player experiences.

## Methodology
