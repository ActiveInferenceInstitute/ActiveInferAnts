## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary arts is deeply intertwined with human history, reflecting cultural practices, technological advancements, and societal changes. From the ancient civilizations that cultivated agriculture to the modern gastronomic movements that celebrate local and sustainable ingredients, cuisine serves as a lens through which we can understand human development. The study of culinary history reveals the significance of regional diversity, the role of trade in ingredient exchange, and the impact of globalization on food practices. Culinary arts encompass not only the preparation and presentation of food but also the rituals, traditions, and narratives that accompany them.

#### Spatial Web

The Spatial Web emerged as a response to the increasing convergence of physical and digital environments, driven by advancements in technology such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This integration aims to create seamless interactions between users and their environments, enhancing the overall user experience. The Spatial Web challenges traditional notions of space and place, allowing for dynamic, context-aware experiences that adapt to user preferences and behaviors. As this field continues to evolve, it faces challenges related to data privacy, user trust, and the need for intuitive design.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cuisine

Contemporary culinary trends emphasize sustainability, health consciousness, and the exploration of global flavors. The rise of plant-based diets, farm-to-table movements, and culinary fusion reflects a growing awareness of the environmental impact of food production and consumption. Furthermore, the digitalization of culinary arts through platforms for recipe sharing, cooking tutorials, and food delivery services highlights the importance of technology in shaping modern culinary experiences.

#### Spatial Web

Current paradigms in the Spatial Web focus on user-centric design principles, emphasizing the importance of personalization, accessibility, and engagement. Challenges in this field include the need for effective data integration, the creation of intuitive interfaces, and the development of experiences that resonate with diverse user demographics. Research in the Spatial Web continues to explore the potential of immersive technologies to enhance user interactions and create meaningful connections between users and their environments.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
