## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology was first introduced in 2008 by an individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in the context of Bitcoin. The key principles of blockchain include decentralization, transparency, and security, which have been foundational in its evolution. Over the past decade, blockchain has expanded beyond cryptocurrencies into various sectors, including supply chain management, healthcare, and environmental science. The development of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts has further enhanced blockchain's applicability, allowing for automated processes and enhanced data integrity.

#### Entomology

Entomology, the scientific study of insects, has a rich historical context dating back to ancient civilizations. Major discoveries in entomology have significantly influenced agriculture, medicine, and ecology. However, contemporary challenges such as biodiversity loss, invasive species, and ineffective pest management strategies pose significant threats to ecological balance. The integration of technology into entomological research, particularly data collection and analysis, remains limited, creating an opportunity for innovative solutions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The latest advancements in blockchain technology include the development of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enhanced security protocols. These advancements offer potential applications in entomology, particularly in data sharing and management. Concurrently, contemporary entomological research emphasizes the importance of biodiversity conservation, the role of insects in ecosystems, and the need for sustainable pest management practices. However, a gap exists in the integration of technological solutions to address these challenges.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This literature review identifies a lack of integrated platforms for data sharing in entomology, which is essential for collaborative research and effective pest management. Additionally, the potential for blockchain to enhance transparency and trust in research methodologies presents an opportunity for significant advancements in the field. This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by proposing a framework that combines blockchain technology with entomological research.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blockchain Principles

The foundational theories of blockchain technology include distributed ledger technology, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Distributed ledger technology allows for multiple copies of data to be stored across a network, enhancing security and reducing the risk of data tampering. Consensus mechanisms, such as proof of work and proof of stake, ensure that all participants in the network agree on the validity of transactions. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, allowing for automated processes without human intervention.

#### Ecological Theories

Ecological theories relevant to this research include biodiversity theories, which emphasize the importance of species diversity for ecosystem resilience, and pest dynamics, which explore the interactions between pest populations and their environments. Additionally, the concept of ecosystem services highlights the benefits that humans derive from ecological processes, including pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes the development of a theoretical model that combines blockchain principles with ecological frameworks to create a holistic understanding of insect management. This model will illustrate how decentralized systems can enhance data integrity, improve pest management strategies, and promote ecological health.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model will highlight the interplay between blockchain technology and entomological research. It will illustrate how decentralized data sharing can lead to improved research collaboration, how smart contracts can optimize pest management strategies, and how tokenization can incentivize conservation efforts. This model will serve as a foundation for the empirical research conducted in this dissertation.
