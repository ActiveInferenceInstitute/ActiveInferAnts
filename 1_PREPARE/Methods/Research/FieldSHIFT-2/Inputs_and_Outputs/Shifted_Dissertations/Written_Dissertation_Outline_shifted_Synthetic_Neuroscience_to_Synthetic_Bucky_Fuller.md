## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has undergone significant evolution, especially in understanding neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis. Neural networks, which mimic the connectivity of neurons in the brain, serve as models for understanding information processing. Synaptic plasticity—the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time—forms the basis of learning and memory. Key historical milestones include the discovery of neurogenesis, which has reshaped our understanding of brain adaptability, and the emergence of computational neuroscience, which leverages mathematical models to simulate brain functions.

#### Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller is renowned for his contributions to architecture, sustainability, and systems thinking. His innovative concepts, such as the geodesic dome and the notion of "doing more with less," have influenced modern architectural practices. Fuller emphasized the importance of holistic design, where every element of a structure works in synergy with others to create efficient and sustainable systems. His philosophy encourages a reevaluation of how we design our built environments to align with natural processes and human needs.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in neuroscience focuses on adaptive systems, emphasizing the brain's capacity for plasticity and resilience. Studies have shown how environments can influence cognitive function and emotional well-being, highlighting the importance of designing spaces that promote positive human experiences. In architecture, there is a growing emphasis on sustainability, with practices that prioritize energy efficiency, resource conservation, and user-centered design. However, the integration of neuroscience into architectural practices remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary approaches that merge neuroscience with architectural design. While both fields have made strides independently, the potential for innovative designs that adapt to user needs and environmental changes remains underutilized. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for neurodesign that leverages insights from neuroscience to inform architectural practices, ultimately leading to more adaptive, sustainable, and human-centered environments.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Theories of Neural Networks

Neural networks provide a foundational understanding of how information is processed and learned within the brain. These networks consist of interconnected neurons that communicate through synapses, forming complex pathways that enable cognitive functions. The principles of neural networks, including feedback loops and adaptive learning, can inform architectural design by creating spaces that respond dynamically to user interactions and environmental stimuli.

#### Fuller's Principles of Synergetics and Tensegrity

Fuller's principles of synergetics and tensegrity offer frameworks for understanding complex systems. Synergetics emphasizes the interconnectedness of components within a system, suggesting that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Tensegrity structures, characterized by a balance of tension and compression, exemplify how stability can be achieved through dynamic relationships among elements. These principles can be applied to architectural design, fostering resilience and adaptability in built environments.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The Shifted Domain gives rise to new theoretical constructs, including a neuroplastic architecture model that incorporates feedback loops and adaptive design principles. This model posits that architectural spaces can be designed to learn from user interactions, much like the brain learns from experience. Additionally, the concept of "neurodesign" emerges as an interdisciplinary framework that synthesizes insights from neuroscience and architecture, emphasizing the importance of designing environments that enhance cognitive and emotional well-being.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes insights from both neuroscience and architecture, highlighting the interconnectivity of design, environment, and human behavior. This model posits that architectural spaces can be designed to mimic neural networks, incorporating adaptive features that respond to user needs and environmental changes. By applying principles of synaptic plasticity and emergent properties, this model aims to create dynamic, resilient, and sustainable built environments.
