# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Neuroscience

The evolution of neuroscience has been marked by several key milestones that have shaped our understanding of the brain and its functions. Early studies in neuroanatomy laid the groundwork for later research into neural networks and synaptic plasticity. The discovery of neurogenesis—the process by which new neurons are formed—has profound implications for understanding learning and memory. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET scans, have allowed researchers to visualize brain activity in real-time, providing insights into cognitive processes and their relationship to environmental stimuli.

### Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller’s contributions to design and sustainability are foundational to modern architectural thought. His concept of the geodesic dome exemplifies efficiency in structural design, utilizing minimal materials to achieve maximum strength. Fuller's principle of ephemeralization—doing more with less—encourages a sustainable approach to resource management. The World Game, another of Fuller's innovations, serves as a platform for global problem-solving, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human systems and the environment.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Neuroscience

Contemporary research in neuroscience has expanded our understanding of neural mechanisms and cognitive processes, revealing the brain's remarkable capacity for adaptation and learning. Studies exploring the impact of environmental factors on neural development have highlighted the importance of creating spaces that promote cognitive and emotional well-being. The implications of this research extend to architecture and urban design, suggesting that built environments can significantly influence human behavior and health.

### Buckminster Fuller

The application of Buckminster Fuller’s principles in architecture and urban planning has gained traction in recent years, with numerous case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of sustainable design practices. Projects that incorporate Fuller's ideas, such as the use of renewable materials and energy-efficient technologies, showcase the potential for creating resilient urban environments. However, there remains a gap in research that explicitly connects these design practices with insights from neuroscience.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research that combines neuroscience with design principles highlights significant opportunities for innovation. By bridging these fields, this dissertation seeks to address the current gaps in understanding how cognitive and emotional responses to design can inform sustainable practices. This research aims to pave the way for new methodologies that integrate scientific insights into the design process, ultimately fostering environments that enhance human experience and ecological integrity.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical foundations of this research draw from key theories in neuroscience and design. In neuroscience, concepts such as neural plasticity—the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections—are pivotal for understanding how environments can influence cognitive development. Network theory, which examines the connections and interactions within complex systems, provides a framework for conceptualizing urban environments as adaptive networks.

In the realm of design, synergetics—the study of how parts interact to create a whole—offers insights into how architectural elements can work together to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal. Ecological design principles emphasize the importance of sustainability and the responsible use of resources, aligning with the ethos of both neuroscience and Fuller's philosophy.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From the intersection of neuroscience and design, several new theoretical constructs emerge, including:

- **Neurodesign**: The application of neuroscience principles to design practices, focusing on how spatial configurations can influence cognitive and emotional responses.
- **Synaptic Sustainability**: A framework that draws parallels between neural connections and sustainable design practices, emphasizing the importance of interconnectedness in ecological systems.
- **Cognitive Urbanism**: An approach that considers the cognitive and emotional impacts of urban environments, advocating for designs that promote well-being and social cohesion.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that illustrates the interconnections between neuroscience and design principles. The model emphasizes adaptability and emergent properties, suggesting that environments designed with an understanding of neural processes can foster resilience and sustainability. By visualizing these relationships, the model serves as a guide for practitioners seeking to implement neuroinformed design strategies.
