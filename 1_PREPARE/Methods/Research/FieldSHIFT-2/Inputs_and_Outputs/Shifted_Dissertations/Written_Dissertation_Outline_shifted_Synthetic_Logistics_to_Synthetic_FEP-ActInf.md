## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The logistics industry has undergone significant evolution over the past few decades, transitioning from traditional supply chain management practices to more sophisticated, technology-driven approaches. The globalization of trade has introduced complexities that necessitate a shift towards more adaptive and responsive logistics systems. Rapid technological advancements, such as automation, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT), have further transformed logistics operations, enabling real-time data analysis and decision-making. At the same time, consumers have become increasingly demanding, expecting faster delivery times and greater transparency regarding the sustainability of their purchases.

In parallel, the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) have emerged as influential frameworks in cognitive science, emphasizing the importance of prediction and adaptation in complex systems. The FEP posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy by continuously updating their beliefs about the world based on incoming sensory information. Similarly, AI focuses on the dynamic processes through which organisms adapt to their environments by making predictions and taking actions that minimize prediction errors. By integrating these frameworks into logistics, we can conceptualize logistics operations as adaptive systems that respond to environmental changes and uncertainties.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research presents a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines established logistics principles with cutting-edge theories from cognitive science. By leveraging the FEP and AI, we aim to redefine logistics as a predictive and adaptive system. This integration offers new insights into operational efficiency, resilience, and sustainability in supply chains. The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape logistics practices, providing practitioners with innovative tools and methodologies to enhance performance and address contemporary challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics operations be modeled as predictive systems using the Free Energy Principle?
2. In what ways can Active Inference enhance decision-making and adaptability in logistics?
3. What are the implications of this integration for sustainability and risk management in supply chains?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of logistics can be traced back to the early days of trade, where the focus was primarily on the physical movement of goods. Over time, logistics has transformed into a complex field encompassing various functions, including transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and order fulfillment. The emergence of concepts such as Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory and supply chain management has further refined logistics practices, emphasizing efficiency and responsiveness.

In contrast, the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference have their roots in cognitive science and systems theory. The FEP, articulated by Karl Friston, posits that living organisms are fundamentally engaged in a process of minimizing free energy, which reflects the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs. This principle has been applied to various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and robotics. Active Inference, closely related to the FEP, emphasizes the role of action in shaping perception and learning, suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environments to reduce uncertainty and improve predictive accuracy.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
In logistics, existing methodologies often focus on optimization and efficiency but may overlook the importance of adaptability in the face of uncertainty. Traditional supply chain models typically rely on deterministic approaches, which can be insufficient in dynamic environments characterized by volatility and unpredictability. Recent advancements in data analytics and machine learning have begun to address these limitations, but there remains a gap in integrating adaptive systems theory into logistics practices.

Conversely, the application of FEP and AI in cognitive and biological systems has garnered significant attention, with researchers exploring how these frameworks can inform our understanding of learning, decision-making, and behavior. However, there is limited exploration of how these principles can be applied to operational domains such as logistics, highlighting a critical gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The disconnect between logistics practices and adaptive systems theory presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research. By bridging these fields, we can develop innovative solutions that enhance logistics efficiency, resilience, and sustainability. This research aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive framework that integrates logistics with the FEP and AI, offering novel insights and methodologies that can transform supply chain operations.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Logistics is grounded in several key principles, including efficiency, optimization, coordination, and sustainability. These principles emphasize the importance of minimizing costs, maximizing resource utilization, and ensuring the smooth flow of goods and information throughout the supply chain. Traditional logistics models often prioritize efficiency, focusing on reducing lead times and operational costs.

The Free Energy Principle is based on several core concepts, including predictive processing, generative models, and entropy minimization. Predictive processing posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on new information. Generative models refer to the internal representations that organisms use to make sense of their environments, while entropy minimization emphasizes the importance of reducing uncertainty in decision-making.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The integration of logistics with the FEP and AI allows for the development of new theoretical constructs that redefine logistics operations. By conceptualizing logistics networks as generative models, we can view supply chains as dynamic systems that continuously adapt to changes in demand, supply, and environmental conditions. This perspective enables a more nuanced understanding of how logistics operations can be optimized for efficiency and resilience.

Furthermore, viewing last-mile delivery as an active inference process highlights the importance of real-time decision-making and adaptability in logistics. By framing last-mile delivery as a process of minimizing prediction errors, we can explore how logistics providers can enhance their responsiveness to customer needs and environmental changes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines logistics optimization with FEP and AI principles. The model emphasizes the interactions between predictive modeling and supply chain dynamics, illustrating how logistics operations can be understood as adaptive systems that strive to minimize free energy.
