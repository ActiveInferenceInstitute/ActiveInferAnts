## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalization, service quality, and the overall environment of service delivery. With the increasing competition in the dining sector, the need for restaurants to differentiate themselves has never been more pressing. In contrast, the culinary domain has traditionally centered on cultural identity, flavor profiles, and cooking techniques. This dissertation seeks to transpose the core principles of guest experience into the culinary realm, thereby creating a new paradigm that enhances the dining experience. 

The concept of guest experience encompasses a wide range of elements including ambiance, service interactions, and the emotional journey of the guest. Conversely, the culinary experience is often viewed through the lens of taste, presentation, and the cultural narrative of the meal. By merging these two perspectives, this research aims to create a holistic model that not only elevates the quality of food but also enriches the overall dining experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it identifies and leverages the synergies between hospitality and culinary experiences, offering a novel approach to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty in the dining sector. The integration of these principles has the potential to transform both industries, fostering a more holistic understanding of the dining experience. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, connecting previously isolated domains and exploring their intersections.

By focusing on personalization, quality management, and sustainability, this dissertation aims to provide actionable insights for practitioners in both fields. The findings could lead to the development of new culinary practices that prioritize the dinerâ€™s experience, ultimately resulting in enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience in hospitality be effectively transposed to enhance culinary experiences?
2. What are the implications of this integration for culinary education and industry practices?
3. How can technology and sustainability be incorporated to optimize the culinary experience?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience principles in hospitality management can be traced back to the early 20th century when hotels and restaurants began to recognize the importance of customer satisfaction as a key driver of business success. Pioneers such as the Ritz-Carlton and Hilton introduced practices aimed at enhancing guest comfort and service quality. The advent of the Experience Economy, as articulated by Pine and Gilmore (1998), further propelled the focus on creating memorable experiences that engage customers on emotional and sensory levels.

#### Culinary Experience in Cuisine

The historical development of culinary practices reflects a rich tapestry of cultural influences, regional ingredients, and traditional cooking techniques. From the elaborate banquets of medieval Europe to the rise of haute cuisine in the 19th century, culinary experiences have always been intertwined with cultural identity. Modern culinary movements, such as farm-to-table and molecular gastronomy, emphasize the importance of ingredient quality and innovative presentation, further enriching the dining experience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Guest Experience

Contemporary research on guest experience highlights the significance of personalization, service quality, and technology integration in enhancing customer satisfaction. Scholars such as Zeithaml et al. (1996) have explored the dimensions of service quality, while recent studies have focused on the role of technology in shaping guest interactions and expectations.

#### Culinary Experience

Current trends in culinary practices underscore the importance of ingredient quality, sensory experiences, and the narrative behind the meal. Research has shown that diners increasingly seek not only taste but also the story and authenticity of their food. The rise of social media has further amplified this trend, as diners share their experiences and seek validation through online platforms.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the extensive research in both hospitality and culinary fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that connects guest experience principles with culinary practices. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by exploring how the integration of these two domains can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. By identifying opportunities for collaboration and innovation, this research seeks to offer a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the dining experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory

Service Quality Theory posits that the quality of service delivered directly impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), identifies five dimensions of service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. Understanding these dimensions is crucial for assessing how they can be transposed into the culinary context.

#### Experience Economy Theory

Experience Economy Theory, as articulated by Pine and Gilmore (1998), suggests that businesses must create memorable experiences to engage customers fully. This theory emphasizes the importance of staging experiences that resonate with customers on emotional and sensory levels, making it highly relevant to both hospitality and culinary fields.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Personalization Theory

Culinary Personalization Theory posits that personalized dining experiences significantly enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction. By allowing diners to customize their meals according to their preferences, restaurants can create a more engaging and satisfying experience.

#### Culinary Servicescape Theory

Culinary Servicescape Theory examines how the dining environment, or servicescape, influences customer perceptions of food quality and overall satisfaction. Elements such as ambiance, seating arrangements, and decor play a critical role in shaping the dining experience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes principles from both domains to create a comprehensive culinary experience framework. This model will serve as a foundation for exploring how guest experience principles can enhance culinary practices, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.
