## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience principles in hospitality management can be traced back to the early 20th century when the hotel industry began to recognize the importance of customer satisfaction. Pioneering figures like CÃ©sar Ritz emphasized the significance of personalized service, luxury, and attention to detail. Over the decades, the focus has shifted towards creating memorable experiences, with frameworks such as the SERVQUAL model emerging to measure service quality across dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles.

#### Culinary Experience in Cuisine

Culinary practices have a rich historical context, deeply intertwined with cultural identity and societal evolution. From ancient civilizations that celebrated communal meals to the rise of haute cuisine in France during the 18th century, culinary arts have reflected cultural values and social structures. The contemporary culinary landscape emphasizes not only the quality of ingredients and cooking techniques but also the sensory experiences associated with dining, including presentation, aroma, and the emotional connection to food.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Guest Experience

Contemporary research on guest experience emphasizes the role of technology in enhancing service delivery. Studies have shown that personalization through data analytics and customer feedback mechanisms significantly enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty. The integration of mobile applications and online booking systems has transformed how guests interact with hospitality services, leading to more tailored experiences.

#### Culinary Experience

Current trends in culinary practices highlight the importance of ingredient quality, sustainability, and sensory experiences. The farm-to-table movement has gained traction, emphasizing local sourcing and transparency in food production. Additionally, the rise of experiential dining, where the process of cooking and serving becomes part of the entertainment, reflects a shift towards creating immersive culinary experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the extensive research in both hospitality and culinary fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that connects guest experience principles with culinary practices. This dissertation aims to address this gap by exploring how the integration of these principles can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Opportunities for enhancing customer satisfaction through integrated approaches include the development of personalized dining experiences that cater to individual preferences and dietary needs, as well as the incorporation of sustainability practices that resonate with socially conscious consumers.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory

Service quality theory posits that the quality of service directly impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, serves as a foundational framework for understanding service quality across various dimensions. This theory will provide a lens through which to examine the quality of culinary experiences and their relationship with customer satisfaction.

#### Experience Economy Theory

Experience economy theory, articulated by Pine and Gilmore, emphasizes the value of experiences in creating customer satisfaction. This theory posits that businesses must create memorable experiences to differentiate themselves in a competitive marketplace. In the context of culinary experiences, this theory will be instrumental in understanding how the dining experience can be enhanced through thoughtful design and personalization.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Personalization Theory

Culinary personalization theory posits that the relationship between personalized dining experiences and customer loyalty is significant. By tailoring menu options and dining environments to individual preferences, restaurants can enhance customer satisfaction and foster loyalty. This theory will guide the exploration of how personalization can be effectively implemented in culinary settings.

#### Culinary Servicescape Theory

Culinary servicescape theory focuses on the impact of the dining environment on customer perceptions of food quality. The physical space, ambiance, and overall aesthetic of a restaurant play a crucial role in shaping diners' experiences. This theory will provide a framework for understanding how the servicescape can be optimized to enhance culinary experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a model that synthesizes principles from both domains to create a comprehensive culinary experience framework. The model will incorporate elements of service quality, experience economy, culinary personalization, and servicescape theories to provide a holistic understanding of how these factors interact to enhance the dining experience. The proposed model will serve as a foundation for empirical research and practical applications in the culinary industry.
