## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Culinary Arts

The culinary arts have evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural, social, and technological changes. From the early days of communal cooking to the intricate gastronomy of modern haute cuisine, culinary practices reflect the values and identities of different societies. The role of innovation in cuisine cannot be understated; it is often driven by the need for sustainability, health consciousness, and the fusion of diverse culinary traditions. 

#### Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology emerged from the desire for a decentralized, secure method of managing digital transactions. Initially conceptualized in the context of cryptocurrencies, it has since found applications across various industries, including finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. The foundational principles of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—provide a robust framework for enhancing trust and efficiency in many applications.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing research in culinary innovation often focuses on the sensory aspects of food, culinary education, and the sociocultural implications of food practices. Concurrently, blockchain research has primarily concentrated on its technical aspects and applications in finance and supply chain management. However, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research connecting culinary arts and blockchain technology. This gap presents an opportunity for new insights and applications that can benefit both fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The absence of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of culinary arts and blockchain technology highlights a significant opportunity. By exploring this uncharted territory, this dissertation aims to contribute to both fields, offering frameworks and applications that can enhance culinary practices while advancing blockchain technology. 

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theory

Culinary theory encompasses various concepts, including flavor profiles, ingredient interaction, and cooking techniques. The understanding of how ingredients complement each other and how techniques can alter the final product is fundamental to culinary innovation. This theoretical foundation will inform the integration of culinary principles into blockchain applications.

#### Blockchain Theory

Blockchain theory is rooted in principles such as decentralization, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. These concepts provide the basis for understanding how blockchain technology operates and how it can be applied across different domains. The exploration of these principles will facilitate the development of a Culinary Blockchain Model.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The development of a "Culinary Blockchain Model" is a central focus of this dissertation. This model will incorporate culinary principles into blockchain frameworks, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how these two fields can inform and enhance each other. 

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual representation of the interplay between culinary concepts and blockchain technology will be developed, illustrating how they can inform and enhance each other. This model will serve as a foundational tool for further research and application development.

## Methodology
