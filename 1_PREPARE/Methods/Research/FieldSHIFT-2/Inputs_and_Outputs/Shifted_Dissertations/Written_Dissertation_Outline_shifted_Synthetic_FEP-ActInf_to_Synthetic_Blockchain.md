## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize surprise and uncertainty through predictive modeling and active inference. This principle has its roots in cognitive science, where it explains how biological systems maintain homeostasis by predicting and responding to environmental changes. Blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger system, relies on consensus mechanisms and smart contracts to ensure secure transactions. The intersection of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to enhance the operational capabilities of blockchain systems by integrating cognitive processes that facilitate adaptation and efficiency.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle
The Free Energy Principle, first articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that living systems function as Bayesian inference machines, continuously updating their beliefs about the world to minimize the difference between anticipated and actual sensory inputs. This principle has profound implications for understanding adaptive behaviors in biological systems, suggesting that organisms are fundamentally engaged in a process of prediction and correction.

#### Evolution of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, offering a decentralized mechanism for secure transactions without the need for intermediaries. Since then, the technology has evolved significantly, with the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that extend its utility beyond simple financial transactions. The introduction of platforms like Ethereum has enabled complex programmable transactions, paving the way for innovative applications across various sectors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Recent Advancements in Predictive Coding
Recent advancements in predictive coding have expanded its applicability beyond neuroscience, influencing areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. The core idea is that systems can enhance their performance by continuously refining their predictions based on incoming data, a concept that holds significant potential for developing more efficient blockchain protocols.

#### Current Trends in Blockchain Technology
Current trends in blockchain technology focus on scalability solutions, such as sharding and layer-2 protocols, alongside governance models that promote decentralization and community participation. Understanding these trends is crucial for identifying how cognitive principles can be integrated to enhance blockchain functionality.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that combines cognitive science with blockchain technology. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring how FEP can inform the development of adaptive blockchain systems. The integration of predictive and adaptive models presents opportunities to enhance transaction efficiency, security, and user engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Key Principles of the Free Energy Principle
The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key concepts, including predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy. Predictive coding suggests that the brain constructs a model of the world to minimize prediction errors, while active inference posits that organisms act to reduce uncertainty by taking actions that align with their predictions. Variational free energy serves as a mathematical formulation that quantifies the difference between predicted and observed states.

#### Core Components of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology is built on several core components, including distributed ledgers, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts. Distributed ledgers provide a shared database that is maintained by multiple participants, ensuring transparency and security. Consensus mechanisms, such as proof of work and proof of stake, facilitate agreement among participants on the state of the ledger. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, enabling automated and trustless transactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The integration of predictive models into transaction validation processes can lead to more efficient and secure blockchain operations. Additionally, the development of adaptive smart contracts informed by active inference can enhance their responsiveness to real-time data, improving overall system performance.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes a framework illustrating the interaction between cognitive processes and blockchain mechanisms. The model emphasizes feedback loops, where predictive coding informs transaction validation, and active inference guides smart contract execution. This integrated approach aims to create a more adaptive and resilient blockchain ecosystem.
