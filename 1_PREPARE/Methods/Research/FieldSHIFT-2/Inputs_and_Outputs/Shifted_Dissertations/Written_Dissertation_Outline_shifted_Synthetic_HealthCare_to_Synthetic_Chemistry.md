## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of patient-centered care has been marked by a shift from a provider-centric model to one that prioritizes patient engagement and satisfaction. This paradigm shift began in the late 20th century, driven by a growing recognition of the importance of patient autonomy and the need for a holistic approach to health care. Key developments include the establishment of frameworks for assessing service quality, such as the SERVQUAL model, which emphasizes the dimensions of tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy.

#### Chemical Reactions

In the field of chemistry, significant advancements in kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis have shaped our understanding of chemical processes. The development of reaction kinetics, which examines the rates of chemical reactions, has been foundational in optimizing reaction conditions. Similarly, thermodynamics provides insights into the energy changes associated with reactions, enabling chemists to predict reaction feasibility. Catalysis, particularly the use of catalysts to enhance reaction rates and selectivity, has become a cornerstone of modern chemical practice, facilitating more efficient and sustainable processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Health Care

Current practices in patient engagement emphasize the importance of shared decision-making, personalized care, and the integration of technology to enhance patient experiences. Innovations such as telemedicine and electronic health records have transformed how care is delivered and monitored, allowing for more responsive and individualized treatment plans.

#### Chemical Reactions

Recent findings in reaction mechanisms, efficiency improvements, and sustainable practices have highlighted the need for more environmentally friendly approaches to chemical synthesis. The principles of green chemistry advocate for the reduction of hazardous substances and waste in chemical processes, promoting sustainability alongside efficiency.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines health care principles with chemical processes. This gap presents opportunities for innovation and improvement, as the application of health care methodologies could lead to enhanced reaction efficiencies, sustainability, and overall quality in chemical practices.
