## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of health care and the Spatial Web represents a groundbreaking shift in how we understand user experiences and interactions. Health care has long emphasized patient-centered care, focusing on individual needs and preferences, while the Spatial Web integrates physical and digital realms through technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This dissertation will explore how principles from health care can enhance user experiences in the Spatial Web.

The Spatial Web is characterized by an immersive digital environment where users interact with information and services in a spatially aware manner. Technologies such as AR and VR enable a more interactive and engaging experience, allowing users to visualize and manipulate data in ways that were previously unattainable. The integration of health care methodologies into this environment can lead to a more personalized and empathetic user experience, enhancing both engagement and satisfaction.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the current gaps in user engagement and satisfaction within digital environments. By applying health care principles to the Spatial Web, the dissertation seeks to create a novel framework that emphasizes empathy, personalization, and quality of experience. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of healthcare concepts to digital design, fostering a new understanding of user interactions.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they have practical applications in improving user experiences in various digital platforms, particularly in health tech. By bridging these two domains, the dissertation aims to provide insights that can lead to more effective and engaging digital health solutions.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Patient-Centered Care in Health Care

Patient-centered care (PCC) has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a paternalistic model to one that prioritizes the preferences, needs, and values of patients. The Institute of Medicine's report in 2001, "Crossing the Quality Chasm," highlighted the importance of patient-centeredness as a core component of quality health care. This shift has been driven by a growing recognition that patient engagement leads to better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. 

PCC emphasizes the importance of communication, shared decision-making, and the holistic understanding of patients' experiences. The principles of PCC can be categorized into several key areas: respect for patients' preferences, coordination and integration of care, information and education, physical comfort, emotional support, and involvement of family and friends. 

#### Development of the Spatial Web and Its Technological Underpinnings

The Spatial Web, a term that encompasses the convergence of digital and physical realities, has emerged as a result of advancements in AR, VR, and IoT technologies. The concept of the Spatial Web is rooted in the idea that the internet can be experienced as a three-dimensional space where users can interact with digital content in a more intuitive manner.

The development of the Spatial Web has been fueled by several technological advancements, including:
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Enhances the real-world environment with digital overlays, allowing users to interact with both physical and digital elements simultaneously.
- **Virtual Reality (VR):** Creates immersive environments that can simulate real-world experiences or entirely new worlds, engaging users in a multisensory manner.
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Connects physical devices to the internet, enabling data collection and interaction in real-time, which can significantly enhance user experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Literature on Patient Experience, Service Quality, and Technology Integration in Health Care

The literature on patient experience in health care emphasizes the importance of understanding patients' perspectives to improve service quality. Several studies have demonstrated that positive patient experiences correlate with better clinical outcomes and higher patient satisfaction. Technology integration, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and telemedicine, has been instrumental in enhancing communication and accessibility, yet challenges remain in ensuring that these technologies are user-friendly and truly meet patients' needs.

#### Analysis of User Experience Design, Data Analytics, and Immersive Technologies in the Spatial Web

User experience (UX) design has evolved to prioritize user needs and preferences, employing methodologies such as user testing, personas, and journey mapping. The integration of data analytics in UX design allows for a more nuanced understanding of user behaviors and preferences, enabling designers to create personalized experiences. Immersive technologies like AR and VR have opened new avenues for UX design, allowing users to engage with content in dynamic and interactive ways. However, the literature reveals a gap in the application of these principles to health care contexts, particularly within the Spatial Web.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of health care and the Spatial Web presents several gaps in current research and practice. Notably, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate patient-centered care principles into user-centered design within digital environments. Furthermore, existing user engagement strategies in the Spatial Web often overlook the emotional and psychological aspects of user interactions, which are critical in health care settings.

Opportunities for innovation abound as digital health solutions continue to evolve. By leveraging health care methodologies, designers can create more empathetic and personalized experiences that cater to users' needs. This research aims to fill these gaps and explore the potential for transformative applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient-Centered Care Theories and Models

Theories of patient-centered care emphasize the importance of understanding patients as individuals with unique experiences and preferences. Models such as the Bio-Psycho-Social Model and the Chronic Care Model highlight the need for holistic approaches to health care, considering not only the biological aspects of health but also psychological and social factors. These models provide a framework for understanding how patient-centered care can be operationalized in practice.

#### User Experience Design Principles

User experience design principles focus on creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. Key principles include usability, accessibility, and emotional engagement. The UX design process typically involves understanding user needs through research, ideation, prototyping, and testing. These principles can be applied to enhance digital health solutions, making them more intuitive and user-friendly.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Integration of Health Care Methodologies into User Experience Design

The integration of health care methodologies into user experience design involves the application of patient-centered care principles to create more engaging and empathetic digital environments. This integration can lead to the development of new constructs that prioritize user experience while considering the unique needs of patients.

#### Development of a Framework for Experience Quality in the Spatial Web

A new framework for experience quality in the Spatial Web can be developed by synthesizing insights from both health care and UX design. This framework should encompass key variables such as personalization, emotional engagement, usability, and user satisfaction. By establishing clear metrics for experience quality, designers can better assess the effectiveness of their digital solutions in meeting users' needs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that illustrates the interaction between patient-centered care and user-centered design. The model highlights key variables such as empathy, personalization, and user engagement, demonstrating how these elements converge to enhance user experiences in the Spatial Web. By visualizing these relationships, the model serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to implement health care principles in digital design.
