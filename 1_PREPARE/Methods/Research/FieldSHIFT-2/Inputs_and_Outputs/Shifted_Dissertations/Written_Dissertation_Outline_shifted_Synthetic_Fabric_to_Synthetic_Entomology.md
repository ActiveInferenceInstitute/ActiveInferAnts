# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Concepts from the Fabric Industry and Arts to Entomology

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with entomology, creating a Shifted Domain that leverages the principles of craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural significance inherent in textiles to address contemporary challenges in insect conservation and sustainable agriculture. By investigating the isomorphisms between these two fields, the research will generate new theoretical constructs and practical applications that promote biodiversity, enhance sustainable practices, and foster a deeper cultural appreciation for insects. The anticipated impact includes advancing interdisciplinary research, informing policy, and revolutionizing educational approaches in both domains.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fabric industry and arts (Domain A) have historically emphasized craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural narratives through textiles. Textiles are not merely functional; they encapsulate stories, traditions, and identities, reflecting the socio-cultural dynamics of the communities that produce them. Concurrently, entomology (Domain B) has focused on understanding insect biology and ecology, addressing critical challenges such as declining populations and environmental sustainability. Insects, which constitute approximately 75% of the planet's biodiversity, play vital roles in ecosystems, including pollination, decomposition, and serving as food sources for other organisms. This dissertation will synthesize these two domains, revealing synergies that can lead to innovative solutions for both the fabric industry and entomological research.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novel integration of textile design principles with entomological practices presents a unique opportunity to develop sustainable solutions for pest management and conservation strategies. The emerging field of entomo-textile studies will provide a framework that highlights the importance of insects in cultural heritage and ecological sustainability. This research will not only contribute to the theoretical discourse but will also inform practical applications that could revolutionize both sectors.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of sustainable textile design inform practices in entomology?
2. In what ways can insect patterns and structures inspire innovative textile designs?
3. What is the cultural significance of insects, and how can this be leveraged for conservation efforts?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has evolved from ancient weaving techniques to modern textile engineering, reflecting technological advancements and cultural shifts. Traditional textile practices, often rooted in local customs, have been increasingly challenged by globalization and mass production. The rise of sustainable fashion movements has sparked renewed interest in eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices, emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift towards sustainability.

#### Development of Entomology as a Scientific Discipline

Entomology, the scientific study of insects, has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations. Major milestones include the classification systems established by Carl Linnaeus and the development of ecological theories in the 20th century. Contemporary entomology encompasses various sub-disciplines, including agricultural entomology, forensic entomology, and conservation entomology, each addressing critical issues related to insect populations and their interactions with ecosystems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Contemporary Practices in Textile Design

Current trends in textile design emphasize sustainability, with a focus on organic materials, recycling, and innovative manufacturing processes. Designers are increasingly utilizing technology, such as 3D printing and digital printing, to create textiles that minimize waste and environmental impact.

#### Review of Current Research in Entomology

Research in entomology is increasingly addressing the challenges posed by climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use. Innovative approaches, such as integrated pest management (IPM) and conservation biological control, are being explored to enhance sustainability in agriculture while preserving beneficial insect populations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Interdisciplinary Research

Despite the recognized importance of both textiles and insects, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges these fields. This gap presents an opportunity to explore how principles from textile design can inform entomological practices and vice versa.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovative Applications

The potential for innovative applications is vast, ranging from developing insect-inspired textiles that promote biodiversity to employing sustainable textile practices in pest management strategies. This dissertation aims to identify and explore these opportunities systematically.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Analysis of Theories Related to Craftsmanship, Sustainability, and Cultural Heritage

Theories of craftsmanship emphasize the importance of skill, tradition, and the connection between maker and material. Sustainability theories highlight the need for practices that meet present needs without compromising future generations. Cultural heritage theories explore how textiles serve as vessels of cultural identity and memory.

#### Review of Ecological Theories and Principles in Entomology

Ecological theories, such as the niche theory and the theory of island biogeography, provide insights into insect populations and their interactions within ecosystems. These theories can inform sustainable practices by highlighting the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of Concepts such as "Entomotextiles" and "Insect-Integrated Design"

The concept of "entomotextiles" refers to textiles that incorporate insect-inspired designs or materials derived from insects. "Insect-integrated design" encompasses practices that consider the ecological roles of insects in textile production and use.

#### Exploration of the Interconnectedness of Ecological and Artistic Practices

This dissertation will explore how ecological principles can inform artistic practices, leading to innovative designs that promote sustainability and biodiversity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, illustrating the relationships between textile design, sustainability, and entomological practices. This model will serve as a foundation for future research and practical applications.
