# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and the life and work of William Blake. By integrating concepts from PME with the rich tapestry of Blake's poetry, visual art, and philosophical insights, this research aims to uncover new interpretations and predictive frameworks that resonate with contemporary societal challenges. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both Blake studies and PME, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and enhancing our understanding of creativity, imagination, and societal dynamics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges the analytical rigor of PME with the artistic and philosophical dimensions of William Blake’s oeuvre. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge across disciplines to inform predictions, while Blake's work embodies a profound exploration of imagination, duality, and human experience. By establishing a connection between these two fields, this dissertation aims to illuminate the predictive capacities inherent in Blake's artistic expressions and philosophical musings.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it challenges traditional boundaries between literary analysis and predictive methodologies. By applying PME principles to Blake's work, the dissertation will reveal the predictive elements inherent in his philosophy and artistry, thus contributing to both fields. The novelty of this approach lies in its interdisciplinary nature, which not only enriches the understanding of Blake's contributions but also enhances the application of PME in literary contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- **How can PME principles be applied to reinterpret William Blake's works?**
- **What predictive frameworks can be developed from Blake’s philosophy of contraries?**
- **In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach inform contemporary societal issues?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

1. **Overview of PME: Origins, Development, and Key Methodologies**
   - Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) has its roots in the convergence of cognitive science, systems thinking, and strategic foresight. Its methodologies focus on synthesizing knowledge from various disciplines to improve predictive accuracy and inform decision-making processes. Key figures in the development of PME include futurists and cognitive psychologists who emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding complex systems.

2. **William Blake: Historical Significance, Major Works, and Traditional Interpretations**
   - William Blake (1757-1827) is celebrated as a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, known for his unique blend of poetry and visual art. His major works, including "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and "The Book of Urizen," reflect profound philosophical inquiries into the nature of humanity, spirituality, and society. Traditional interpretations often focus on his mystical vision and social critique, yet there remains a lack of engagement with the predictive dimensions of his work.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

1. **Recent Advancements in PME and Its Applications Across Disciplines**
   - Recent advancements in PME have seen its application in various fields, including business strategy, public policy, and environmental science. The integration of data analytics and machine learning has enhanced the predictive capabilities of PME, allowing for more nuanced understanding of societal trends and human behavior.

2. **Current Scholarship on Blake’s Works, Focusing on Romanticism, Spirituality, and Social Critique**
   - Contemporary scholarship on Blake has expanded to include feminist readings, postcolonial critiques, and eco-criticism, yet there remains a dearth of studies that explore the predictive potential of his work. Scholars have highlighted the dualities present in Blake's poetry, yet few have connected these dualities to predictive methodologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

1. **Lack of Interdisciplinary Engagement in Blake Studies**
   - There exists a significant gap in the interdisciplinary engagement between literary studies and predictive methodologies. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by applying PME principles to Blake's works.

2. **Underexplored Predictive Elements in Blake’s Creative Processes**
   - Despite the rich philosophical content of Blake's work, the predictive elements embedded within his artistic expressions remain largely unexamined. This research seeks to uncover these elements and explore their implications for contemporary society.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Key Theories in PME: Systems Thinking, Strategic Foresight, and Cognitive Flexibility**
   - Systems thinking emphasizes the interconnectedness of various elements within a system, allowing for a holistic understanding of complex phenomena. Strategic foresight involves anticipating future developments and preparing for them through informed decision-making. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to adapt one's thinking in response to changing circumstances, which is essential for effective prediction.

2. **Major Philosophical Constructs in Blake’s Work: Imagination, Contraries, and Visionary Experience**
   - Blake’s philosophy is rooted in the concept of imagination as a transformative power. His exploration of contraries—such as innocence and experience, heaven and hell—serves as a framework for understanding human existence and societal dynamics. Visionary experience, characterized by transcendent insights, is central to Blake's artistic and poetic endeavors.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Predictive Imagination as a Synthesis of Creativity and Foresight**
   - This construct posits that the imaginative processes inherent in artistic creation can serve as a predictive tool, allowing for the anticipation of societal trends and challenges. By examining Blake's imaginative works, we can derive insights that inform predictive frameworks.

2. **Contrary Synthesis as a Method for Integrating Opposing Ideas**
   - Contrary synthesis involves the integration of opposing ideas to create a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues. This method can be applied to Blake's dualities, providing a framework for analyzing contemporary societal dilemmas.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines PME principles with Blake’s concepts to create a framework for analyzing and predicting societal trends through artistic expression. This model will facilitate a deeper understanding of how Blake’s work can inform predictive methodologies and vice versa.

   - A systematic textual analysis will be conducted to identify key themes, motifs, and predictive elements within Blake's poetry and visual art. This analysis will draw on existing scholarship while also innovatively interpreting Blake's texts through the lens of PME.

2. **Interviews with Experts in Literature, Art, and Predictive Analytics**
   - Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with experts across various fields to gather insights on the intersections of Blake's work and predictive methodologies. These interviews will provide valuable perspectives on the applicability of PME in literary contexts.

### Analytical Approaches

1. **Thematic Analysis to Identify Key Motifs in Blake’s Work**
