## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the past century. Early hospitality practices focused primarily on providing basic services such as shelter and food. However, as consumer expectations have increased, the industry has shifted towards optimizing guest experiences through personalization, service quality, and cultural engagement. Key milestones in this evolution include the introduction of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which allow businesses to tailor services to individual preferences, and the rise of experiential tourism, which emphasizes immersive cultural experiences.

#### Traditional Knowledge

Traditional knowledge systems have been developed over generations by indigenous communities, encompassing a wide range of practices related to agriculture, medicine, resource management, and spirituality. These systems are characterized by their holistic understanding of the environment and their emphasis on sustainability and community well-being. Historically, traditional knowledge has been transmitted orally, through storytelling, rituals, and community practices. However, globalization and modernization have posed significant challenges to the preservation of these systems, making it imperative to explore innovative ways to share and appreciate this knowledge.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Hospitality

Contemporary trends in the hospitality industry emphasize the importance of guest experience as a key driver of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Research has highlighted the role of personalization, service quality, and technology integration in enhancing guest experiences. For example, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics allows hospitality businesses to anticipate guest needs and preferences, creating a more tailored experience. Additionally, there is a growing recognition of the importance of cultural engagement, with many hospitality providers seeking to incorporate local traditions and practices into their offerings.

#### Traditional Knowledge

Current research on traditional knowledge focuses on its preservation and transmission in the face of modernization. Scholars have explored various methods for documenting and sharing traditional practices, including digital storytelling, community-based participatory research, and the use of social media platforms. There is also a growing recognition of the value of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in informing contemporary sustainability initiatives, particularly in the context of climate change and biodiversity conservation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing interest in both hospitality and traditional knowledge, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research connecting these domains. This gap presents a unique opportunity to enhance cultural engagement and sustainability through the fusion of guest experience principles and traditional knowledge systems. By exploring this intersection, we can identify innovative approaches to sharing and appreciating traditional practices, ultimately contributing to the resilience of both indigenous communities and the hospitality industry.
