## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, characterized by creativity, customization, and cultural significance, contrasts sharply with the standardization and efficiency of ATM transactions. The fabric industry has long been a canvas for artistic expression, allowing for the personalization of textiles that reflect individual and communal identities. In contrast, ATMs have evolved primarily to maximize efficiency, security, and user convenience, often at the expense of personalization and cultural representation. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, exploring how principles from textile design can enhance the functionality and user engagement of ATMs. By examining the potential for integrating artistic and sustainable practices into ATM design, this research aims to create a more engaging and socially responsible banking experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for personalized banking experiences, particularly in an era where consumers increasingly seek products and services that resonate with their values. The emphasis on sustainability and cultural representation in technology is particularly relevant in today's climate-conscious society. The novelty lies in the application of artistic principles to financial technology, creating a new paradigm that challenges existing norms. By proposing a framework that combines the aesthetic and functional aspects of ATM design, this dissertation aims to fill a critical gap in the literature and practice of both the fabric industry and financial technology.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can customizable ATM interfaces enhance user satisfaction and engagement?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating artistic elements into ATM designs?
3. How can sustainable practices be effectively implemented in ATM operations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Fabric Industry:** The evolution of textile design has been marked by significant milestones, from the invention of the loom to the rise of digital printing technologies. Historically, textiles have served not only functional purposes but also cultural ones, often acting as a medium for storytelling and identity expression. The industry's shift toward sustainability has gained momentum in recent years, with an increasing focus on eco-friendly materials and ethical production practices.
  
- **ATM Transactions:** The Automated Teller Machine (ATM) has undergone substantial transformation since its inception in the late 1960s. Initially designed for cash dispensing, ATMs have evolved to include various services such as deposits, bill payments, and account inquiries. However, the standardization of ATM interfaces has often led to a lack of personalization, with user experience primarily focused on efficiency and security measures.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Fabric Industry:** Current trends in the fabric industry emphasize customization and sustainability, with innovations such as 3D knitting and digital textile printing allowing for greater personalization. Additionally, the integration of technology, such as smart textiles, is reshaping the industry's landscape.

- **ATM Transactions:** In the realm of financial technology, user experience has become a focal point, with banks and financial institutions investing in research to enhance accessibility and engagement. However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the personalization of banking interfaces and the integration of cultural elements.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements in both fields, a significant gap exists in the personalization and cultural representation of ATM designs. Current ATM interfaces often fail to reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds and preferences of users. This dissertation identifies the potential for sustainable practices to be integrated into ATM operations, thereby addressing environmental concerns while enhancing user engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Design Thinking:** This user-centered design methodology emphasizes empathy, ideation, and prototyping. It encourages designers to understand users' needs and experiences, making it particularly relevant for developing customizable ATM interfaces.

- **User Experience Theory:** Established frameworks such as Norman's principles of interaction design highlight the importance of usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction in technology. These principles can guide the design of more engaging ATM interfaces.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cultural ATM Theory:** This emerging theory posits that cultural representation in ATM design can significantly impact user engagement. By incorporating local artistic elements and cultural motifs, ATMs can foster a sense of community and belonging.

- **Sustainable ATM Model:** This framework outlines the principles of eco-friendly ATM operations, including the use of sustainable materials, energy-efficient technologies, and community-oriented practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines design thinking, user experience theory, and sustainability principles to guide the development of customizable ATM interfaces. This model will serve as a foundation for the research methodologies and experiments outlined in subsequent chapters.

## Methodology
