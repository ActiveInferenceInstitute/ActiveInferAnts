## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy, thereby maintaining their states in a constantly changing environment. This principle, rooted in thermodynamics and information theory, provides a compelling framework for understanding the self-organizing and adaptive behaviors of living organisms. Conversely, neural networks, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence, focus on optimizing signal processing and learning through data-driven approaches. These systems operate by adjusting weights and biases in response to input data to minimize a loss function, often without a direct analogy to biological processes.

The intersection of FEP and neural networks presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our understanding of intelligence, both biological and artificial. By examining the principles underlying FEP and their potential application to neural networks, this research seeks to redefine the operational paradigms of AI systems, fostering a deeper integration of biological insights into computational models.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it proposes a conceptual and practical framework that redefines the operation of neural networks through principles derived from FEP. The novelty lies in the synthesis of biological insights with computational models, potentially leading to more robust and adaptable AI systems. By transposing FEP into neural networks, we can develop algorithms that better mimic the adaptive and predictive capabilities seen in biological organisms.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical advancements; they may lead to practical applications in various fields, including robotics, cognitive science, and the development of intelligent systems that can learn and adapt in real-time. The integration of FEP into AI could also provide a foundation for creating more explainable and interpretable models, addressing some of the ethical concerns associated with black-box algorithms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be effectively transposed into neural network architectures?
2. What novel learning algorithms can emerge from this integration?
3. How can the new theoretical constructs influence both fields and lead to practical applications?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in the work of Helmholtz and later developments in statistical mechanics and Bayesian inference. It was popularized in neuroscience by Karl Friston, who articulated its implications for understanding brain function as a predictive organ. Friston's work emphasized the brain's role in minimizing prediction error through active inference and has since influenced a multitude of fields, including cognitive science and philosophy of mind.

On the other hand, neural networks date back to the mid-20th century, with significant advancements occurring in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly with the introduction of backpropagation and deep learning techniques. The resurgence of interest in neural networks in recent years has led to breakthroughs in various applications, from image recognition to natural language processing.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent findings in FEP highlight its applicability in cognitive science, where it has been used to explain phenomena such as perception, action, and learning. The principle has been employed to understand disorders of perception and cognition, providing insights into conditions like schizophrenia and autism.

In the realm of neural networks, advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning have revolutionized AI. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks ranging from image classification to game playing. However, these models often lack the interpretability and adaptability seen in biological systems, which FEP could help address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the progress in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research linking FEP and neural networks. Most existing studies focus on either domain independently, neglecting the potential insights that could arise from their integration. This presents an opportunity for new theoretical models and practical applications that leverage both domains, potentially leading to the development of AI systems that are not only more efficient but also more aligned with biological learning processes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Variational Free Energy

Variational free energy is a central concept in FEP, representing the difference between the predicted and actual states of a system. In biological systems, this principle underlies the brain's ability to make predictions about sensory input and minimize prediction error. The brain continuously updates its internal model of the world based on incoming sensory information, striving to align its predictions with reality.

#### Active Inference

Active inference extends the FEP by positing that organisms do not merely passively respond to stimuli but actively seek to minimize free energy through action. This framework emphasizes the role of behavior in shaping perception and cognition, suggesting that organisms engage in exploratory activities to gather information and refine their predictive models.

#### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that describes how the brain processes information. It posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on prediction errors. This concept aligns closely with the variational free energy framework, emphasizing the importance of minimizing discrepancies between expected and observed states.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Neural Variational Free Energy

The concept of "Neural Variational Free Energy" emerges as a metric for evaluating neural network performance. This framework draws parallels between the variational free energy in biological systems and the loss functions used in neural networks. By framing neural network optimization in terms of variational free energy, we can develop new metrics that account for the uncertainty and adaptability of learning processes.

#### Generative Connectivity

"Generative Connectivity" is proposed as a framework for neural network architecture, emphasizing the importance of connectivity patterns that facilitate generative modeling. This approach draws on ideas from FEP, suggesting that neural networks should be designed to predict future states based on current inputs, akin to how biological systems generate predictions about their environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a new model that integrates FEP with neural network learning algorithms, highlighting the interplay between prediction, error minimization, and adaptive learning.
