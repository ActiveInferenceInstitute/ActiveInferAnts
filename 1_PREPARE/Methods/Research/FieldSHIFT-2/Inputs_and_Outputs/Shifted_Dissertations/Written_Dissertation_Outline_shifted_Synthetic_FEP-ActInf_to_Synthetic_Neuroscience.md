## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), primarily formulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems maintain their states by minimizing free energy, which can be understood as a measure of surprise or prediction error. This principle has provided a unifying framework for understanding a variety of cognitive processes, including perception, action, and learning. In contrast, neural networks, particularly in artificial intelligence, operate on the premise of optimizing signal processing and learning through data-driven approaches, often utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.

The fusion of these two domains presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our understanding of intelligence, both biological and artificial. By applying the principles of FEP to the development of neural networks, we can explore mechanisms of adaptive learning that more closely resemble biological processes, potentially leading to the creation of more robust and efficient AI systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it proposes a conceptual and practical framework that redefines the operation of neural networks through principles derived from the FEP. The novelty lies in the synthesis of biological insights with computational models, which could lead to the development of learning algorithms that are not only more efficient but also more aligned with human cognitive processes. By bridging the gap between neuroscience and AI, this work aims to contribute to the theoretical foundations of both fields while providing practical applications that can enhance the capabilities of artificial systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be effectively transposed into neural network architectures?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The development of the Free Energy Principle in neuroscience has evolved significantly since its inception. Friston's work has drawn from variational inference, Bayesian brain theories, and predictive coding, establishing a framework that posits the brain as a predictive machine. This historical context is essential for understanding how biological systems utilize free energy minimization to adapt to their environments.

Similarly, the historical advancements in neural network theory and practice have transitioned from simple perceptrons to complex deep learning architectures. The resurgence of interest in neural networks, particularly with the advent of deep learning, has revolutionized the field of AI, allowing for unprecedented capabilities in tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent findings in the FEP have underscored its applicability in cognitive science, providing insights into how organisms interpret sensory information and make decisions. The principle has been applied to various domains, including perception, motor control, and social cognition, illustrating its versatility and relevance.

In parallel, advancements in neural networks, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning, have led to significant improvements in AI performance across numerous applications. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have enabled machines to achieve human-level performance in tasks previously thought to be the exclusive domain of human intelligence.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research linking FEP and neural networks. This gap presents an opportunity for the development of new theoretical models and practical applications that leverage the strengths of both domains. By integrating FEP principles into neural network architectures, we can explore new avenues for enhancing learning efficiency and adaptability in artificial systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The foundational theories underpinning the Free Energy Principle include variational free energy, active inference, and predictive coding. Variational free energy serves as a measure of how well a model predicts sensory input, with lower values indicating better predictions. Active inference extends this concept by framing perception and action as processes aimed at minimizing free energy through the updating of beliefs and actions.

In the realm of neural networks, foundational concepts include feedforward and feedback connections, activation functions, and learning mechanisms such as backpropagation. These principles govern how neural networks process information and learn from data, forming the backbone of contemporary AI systems.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research introduces the concept of "Neural Variational Free Energy" as a metric for evaluating neural network performance. By adapting the principles of variational free energy to neural networks, we can create a framework for assessing how well these systems predict and adapt to new information.

Additionally, the development of "Generative Connectivity" as a framework for neural network architecture emphasizes the importance of generative models in predicting future states. This approach aligns with the FEP's emphasis on predictive coding, suggesting that neural networks can be designed to not only process input but also generate predictions about future outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines the principles of FEP with neural network learning algorithms. This model highlights the interplay between prediction, error minimization, and adaptive learning, suggesting that neural networks can be enhanced by incorporating mechanisms that reflect biological processes. By aligning the architecture and learning algorithms of neural networks with FEP principles, we can create systems that are more efficient and capable of adaptive learning.
