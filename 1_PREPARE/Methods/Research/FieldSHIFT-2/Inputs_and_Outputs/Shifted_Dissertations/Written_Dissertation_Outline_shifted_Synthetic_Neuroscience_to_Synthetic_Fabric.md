## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience: Evolution and Key Discoveries

The evolution of neuroscience has been marked by significant milestones, from the early anatomical studies of the brain to the advent of neuroimaging technologies. Key discoveries related to neural networks and synaptic plasticity have illuminated our understanding of how neural circuits adapt and reorganize in response to experience. The concept of synaptic plasticity, which refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, underpins many cognitive processes, including learning and memory. This foundational knowledge provides a framework for exploring how similar adaptive mechanisms can be applied to textile design.

#### The Fabric Industry: Craftsmanship to Industrialization

The fabric industry has undergone a profound transformation from artisanal craftsmanship to mass production, marked by the Industrial Revolution. This shift brought about innovations in textile manufacturing, leading to increased efficiency and accessibility. However, contemporary movements toward sustainability and ethical production practices have prompted a reevaluation of traditional methodologies. The historical development of the fabric industry sets the stage for exploring how neuroscience can inform and enhance these evolving practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Recent Advancements in Neuroscience

Recent advancements in neuroscience, particularly in neuroplasticity and cognitive neuroscience, have revealed the brain's remarkable ability to adapt and reorganize itself throughout life. Research has shown that experiences can lead to structural changes in the brain, influencing behavior, cognition, and emotional responses. These insights provide a rich context for understanding how textiles can be designed to elicit specific cognitive and emotional reactions in users.

#### Current Trends in the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry is currently experiencing a paradigm shift toward sustainable practices, technological innovations, and a deeper understanding of consumer behavior. Trends such as the rise of smart textiles, which incorporate electronic components to respond to environmental stimuli, highlight the potential for integrating cognitive principles into textile design. Additionally, consumer demand for personalized and emotionally resonant products underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to textile production.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges neuroscience and the fabric industry. The potential for innovation through the application of cognitive principles to textile design remains largely unexplored. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for collaboration and experimentation that can lead to the development of cognitive textiles—materials that adapt to user interactions and environmental conditions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theoretical constructs in neuroscience, including neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter functions, provide a foundation for understanding cognitive processes. Neural networks, composed of interconnected neurons, facilitate information processing and communication within the brain. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken based on activity, is crucial for learning and memory. Neurotransmitter functions, which involve chemical messengers that transmit signals between neurons, play a vital role in mood regulation and emotional responses.

#### Textile Design Theories

Foundational theories in textile design, such as color theory, material science, and cultural significance, inform the aesthetic and functional aspects of textiles. Color theory, for instance, explores how colors can evoke emotions and influence perceptions, while material science examines the properties of fibers and fabrics. Understanding these theories is essential for integrating cognitive principles into textile design.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Textile Networks and Cognitive Textiles

The introduction of concepts such as “Textile Networks” and “Cognitive Textiles” bridges the gap between neuroscience and fabric design. Textile Networks refer to the interconnected systems within the fabric supply chain, where each node contributes to the overall production process. Cognitive Textiles, on the other hand, are materials designed to respond to user interactions and environmental stimuli, drawing parallels with neural processes in the brain.

#### Theory of Adaptive Fabrication

The development of a theory of “Adaptive Fabrication” utilizes feedback mechanisms to inform design and production. This theory posits that textiles can be designed to adapt based on user feedback, similar to how neural circuits adjust in response to experiences. By incorporating adaptive strategies, the fabric industry can enhance sustainability and user engagement.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that synthesizes theories from both fields illustrates the connections between neural processes and textile production. This model emphasizes the importance of feedback loops, adaptability, and emotional engagement in the design and production of cognitive textiles. By visualizing these connections, the model serves as a framework for future research and practical applications.
