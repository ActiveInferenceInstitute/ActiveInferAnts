## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the confluence of neuroscience—a field dedicated to understanding the complexities of the nervous system—and the fabric industry, which encompasses textile production and design. This intersection invites a reimagining of how textiles can be designed, produced, and experienced, leveraging insights from neuroscience to create responsive and adaptive materials. The burgeoning field of neuroaesthetics, which explores how neural mechanisms influence aesthetic experiences, serves as a foundational context for this research. By understanding how the brain processes sensory information, we can design textiles that not only meet functional requirements but also engage users on emotional and cognitive levels.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel as it explores uncharted territory where cognitive science informs textile design, leading to innovations such as smart textiles that adapt to environmental stimuli and user interactions. By integrating principles of neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter functions into textile production, this dissertation aims to establish a new paradigm that enhances sustainability, personalization, and emotional engagement in textiles. The implications of such innovations extend beyond mere functionality; they challenge traditional notions of textile design and production, inviting a holistic approach that considers the user's psychological and emotional context.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- **How can principles from neuroscience inform and transform textile design and production?**
- **In what ways can the fabric industry adopt adaptive strategies similar to synaptic plasticity to enhance sustainability?**
- **What are the implications of cognitive textiles on user experience and emotional well-being?**

These questions guide the inquiry into how the principles of neuroscience can be harnessed to create textiles that are not only functional but also resonate with users on deeper cognitive and emotional levels.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Neuroscience

Neuroscience has undergone significant evolution since its inception, marked by key discoveries that have reshaped our understanding of the nervous system. The identification of neural networks, which are interconnected groups of neurons that process information, has been pivotal. Early studies on synaptic plasticity demonstrated how neural connections strengthen or weaken over time, a concept that parallels learning and memory processes. The advent of neuroimaging technologies in the late 20th century allowed for real-time visualization of brain activity, further deepening our understanding of cognitive functions.

#### Examination of the Fabric Industry’s Historical Development

Conversely, the fabric industry has evolved from artisanal craftsmanship to large-scale industrial production. The Industrial Revolution marked a significant turning point, introducing mechanization and mass production techniques. In recent decades, there has been a resurgence of interest in sustainable practices, driven by consumer demand for environmentally friendly products. This historical context sets the stage for exploring how insights from neuroscience can inform contemporary textile production and design.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Summary of Recent Advancements in Neuroscience

Recent advancements in neuroscience, particularly in neuroplasticity and cognitive neuroscience, highlight the brain's remarkable ability to adapt and reorganize itself in response to experiences. Research has shown that sensory experiences can influence neural pathways, suggesting that the design of textiles could be tailored to enhance sensory engagement and emotional responses.

#### Review of Current Trends in the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry is currently witnessing trends such as the integration of technology into textiles (e-textiles), sustainable practices, and a focus on consumer-centric design. These trends align with the growing interest in creating textiles that not only serve functional purposes but also engage users on emotional and cognitive levels.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Interdisciplinary Research

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges neuroscience and textile design. Most existing studies focus on either field in isolation, neglecting the potential insights that could emerge from their intersection. 

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation

This gap presents an opportunity for innovation through the application of cognitive principles to textile design. By examining how neural processes influence sensory experiences, designers can create textiles that adapt to user interactions, thereby enhancing emotional engagement and overall user experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Overview of Key Theoretical Constructs in Neuroscience

Key theoretical constructs in neuroscience include neural networks, which describe how groups of neurons communicate and process information, and synaptic plasticity, which refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time based on activity levels. Understanding these concepts is crucial for exploring how textile design can mimic these processes to create adaptive and responsive materials.

#### Discussion of Foundational Theories in Textile Design

In textile design, foundational theories such as color theory, material science, and the cultural significance of textiles inform how materials are perceived and utilized. Color theory, for instance, explores how colors affect mood and behavior, while material science examines the properties of fibers and fabrics. These theories provide a framework for understanding how textiles can influence cognitive and emotional responses.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Introduction of Concepts such as “Textile Networks” and “Cognitive Textiles”

Emerging from this intersection are concepts such as “Textile Networks,” which conceptualize the fabric supply chain as an interconnected system akin to neural networks, and “Cognitive Textiles,” which refer to materials designed to respond to cognitive and emotional stimuli. These constructs pave the way for innovative approaches in textile design that prioritize user experience.

#### Development of a Theory of “Adaptive Fabrication”

The proposed theory of “Adaptive Fabrication” utilizes feedback mechanisms to inform design and production. This theory posits that textiles can be designed to adapt over time based on user interactions and environmental conditions, mirroring the adaptability seen in neural circuits.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model presented in this dissertation synthesizes theories from both fields, illustrating the connections between neural processes and textile production. This model serves as a foundation for exploring how insights from neuroscience can inform textile design, leading to innovations that enhance user experience.
