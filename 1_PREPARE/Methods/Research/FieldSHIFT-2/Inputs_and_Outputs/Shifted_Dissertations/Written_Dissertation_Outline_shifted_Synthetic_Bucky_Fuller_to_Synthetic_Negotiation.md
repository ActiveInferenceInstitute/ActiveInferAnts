## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s holistic design principles and the art of negotiation. Fuller’s work emphasizes sustainability, resource management, and systems thinking, while negotiation focuses on achieving mutually beneficial agreements. This intersection presents an opportunity to reimagine negotiation practices through a lens of sustainability and collaborative problem-solving. Fuller’s principles, such as the notion of "doing more with less," can be applied to negotiation strategies to create value that transcends traditional win-lose scenarios.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional negotiation paradigms by introducing Fuller’s concepts, which advocate for a more integrated and anticipatory approach. The novelty lies in the systematic application of Fuller's principles to negotiation contexts, potentially leading to innovative negotiation strategies that prioritize long-term sustainability and relational dynamics. By redefining negotiation through the Shifted Domain, this dissertation aims to provide a framework that aligns with contemporary global challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

2. What new theoretical frameworks can be developed to integrate systems thinking into negotiation?
3. In what ways can the application of these principles lead to more effective and resilient negotiation outcomes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Buckminster Fuller’s Contributions to Architecture, Design, and Sustainability

Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was a visionary architect, designer, and futurist, renowned for his innovative ideas on sustainability and efficient resource use. His contributions, including the geodesic dome and the concept of ephemeralization—the ability to do more with less—have had a profound impact on architecture and design. Fuller’s work emphasized the interconnectedness of systems and the importance of viewing problems holistically, which is increasingly relevant in today’s complex global landscape.

#### Examination of the Evolution of Negotiation Theories and Practices

Negotiation has evolved from simple transactional exchanges to a complex field that encompasses various theories and practices. Traditional negotiation theories, such as distributive bargaining, focus on competitive tactics, while integrative negotiation emphasizes collaboration and mutual gain. The evolution of these theories reflects a growing understanding of the importance of relationships and shared objectives, aligning with Fuller’s principles of synergy and sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Existing Literature on Fuller’s Principles and Their Applications

Existing literature on Fuller’s principles highlights their applicability across various domains, including architecture, urban planning, and environmental sustainability. However, there remains a gap in the application of these principles to negotiation practices. While some scholars have touched upon the intersection of design and negotiation, a comprehensive framework that systematically integrates Fuller’s concepts into negotiation strategies is lacking.

#### Review of Contemporary Negotiation Strategies and Their Limitations

Contemporary negotiation strategies often prioritize short-term gains over long-term relationships and sustainability. While integrative approaches have gained traction, they frequently fall short of addressing systemic issues such as resource depletion and environmental degradation. This limitation underscores the need for a new framework that incorporates Fuller’s holistic design principles to foster more sustainable negotiation practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Current Negotiation Theories Regarding Sustainability and Resource Management

Current negotiation theories often overlook the critical importance of sustainability and resource management. This gap presents an opportunity to develop a theoretical framework that incorporates Fuller’s principles, enabling negotiators to address environmental and social considerations while achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.

#### Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Research That Bridges the Two Domains

The Shifted Domain offers a fertile ground for interdisciplinary research that bridges the fields of design science and negotiation. By exploring the synergies between these domains, researchers can develop innovative methodologies that enhance negotiation practices, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and equitable outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science

Fuller’s concept of comprehensive anticipatory design science emphasizes the importance of foresight and sustainability in design processes. This approach encourages practitioners to consider the long-term implications of their decisions, fostering a mindset that prioritizes ecological and social well-being.

#### Systems Theory and Synergetics

Systems theory posits that complex systems are composed of interdependent parts that interact in dynamic ways. Synergetics, a term coined by Fuller, further explores the principles of organization and coherence within systems. By applying these theories to negotiation, practitioners can better understand the interconnectedness of stakeholders and the importance of collaborative problem-solving.

#### Negotiation Theories (e.g., Interest-Based Negotiation, Win-Win Strategies)

Interest-based negotiation and win-win strategies focus on identifying the underlying interests of parties involved in a negotiation. These approaches align with Fuller’s principles by promoting collaboration and mutual benefit, yet they often lack a comprehensive framework for incorporating sustainability considerations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Synergetic Negotiation Theory

Synergetic negotiation theory builds upon existing negotiation frameworks by integrating principles of systems thinking and collaboration. This theory emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader context of negotiations, recognizing that outcomes are not merely the result of individual actions but rather the product of complex interactions among stakeholders.

#### Tensegrity Model of Negotiation

The tensegrity model of negotiation draws from Fuller’s concept of tensegrity—structures that maintain integrity through a balance of tension and compression. In negotiation, this model advocates for flexible and adaptable agreements that can withstand changes in context and stakeholder dynamics, promoting resilience and sustainability.

#### Ephemeralization Hypothesis

Fuller’s ephemeralization hypothesis, which suggests that technological advancements can lead to more efficient resource use, can be applied to negotiation by encouraging parties to seek innovative solutions that maximize value while minimizing resource consumption. This hypothesis aligns with contemporary efforts to promote sustainable practices in various sectors.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model combines Fuller’s principles with negotiation strategies, highlighting the interconnectedness of systems, resources, and relationships. This model serves as a foundation for developing practical methodologies that enhance negotiation practices while promoting sustainability and collaboration.
