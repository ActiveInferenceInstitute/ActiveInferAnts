## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a theoretical framework that posits that living systems strive to minimize surprise, or free energy, to maintain their integrity and adapt to their environments. This principle has been widely applied in various domains, including cognitive science, neuroscience, and biology, providing insights into how organisms process information and interact with their surroundings. On the other hand, quantum computation leverages the unique properties of quantum mechanics—such as superposition, entanglement, and coherence—to process information in ways that classical systems cannot. By bridging these two domains, this dissertation seeks to explore how principles of adaptive behavior, as articulated by the FEP, can inform and enhance quantum information processing.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective on quantum computation, viewing qubits and quantum algorithms through the lens of biological principles. The integration of FEP into quantum mechanics not only offers new theoretical insights but also practical applications in algorithm development and machine learning. By examining the parallels between adaptive systems in biology and the computational processes in quantum systems, this dissertation aims to uncover new methodologies that can optimize quantum algorithms and enhance their efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the concept of variational free energy be applied to optimize quantum algorithms?
2. In what ways do generative models in FEP correspond to quantum states in quantum computation?
3. What are the implications of active inference for the measurement processes in quantum systems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle, first articulated by Karl Friston, has its roots in statistical mechanics and Bayesian inference. It posits that biological systems are inherently predictive, constantly updating their beliefs about the world based on sensory inputs. This framework has been successfully applied to understand various cognitive processes, from perception to decision-making.

Conversely, quantum computation emerged in the late 20th century, building on the principles of quantum mechanics established by physicists such as Niels Bohr and Richard Feynman. The development of quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases, has demonstrated the potential of quantum systems to outperform classical counterparts in specific computational tasks.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in FEP have revealed its implications for understanding cognition and adaptive behavior. Research has demonstrated how predictive coding can account for perceptual phenomena and decision-making processes, emphasizing the role of prior beliefs in shaping sensory experiences.

In the realm of quantum computation, state-of-the-art algorithms continue to evolve, with a focus on leveraging quantum entanglement and superposition to achieve computational advantages. Quantum machine learning is a burgeoning field, exploring how quantum algorithms can enhance classical machine learning techniques.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich developments in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects cognitive science and quantum mechanics. This dissertation aims to address this gap by exploring how the principles of FEP can inform quantum information processing, offering theoretical and practical contributions that bridge these domains.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in two key theories: predictive coding and active inference. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on the difference between expected and actual sensory information. Active inference extends this concept, suggesting that organisms actively sample their environments to minimize prediction errors and surprise.

In quantum mechanics, foundational principles such as superposition, entanglement, and measurement are crucial for understanding how quantum systems operate. Superposition allows quantum bits (qubits) to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement enables correlations between qubits that transcend classical boundaries. Measurement in quantum systems is inherently probabilistic, leading to unique challenges in information processing.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces the concept of Quantum Free Energy as a measure of informational efficiency in quantum systems. By drawing parallels between variational free energy in FEP and the informational content of quantum states, the Quantum Free Energy framework provides a novel lens through which to analyze quantum algorithms.

Additionally, the development of the Quantum Predictive Coding Model highlights the potential correspondence between generative models in FEP and quantum states. This model posits that quantum systems can be understood as predictive agents that minimize uncertainty through the manipulation of quantum states.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model combines principles from FEP and quantum computation, detailing how they interact and inform each other. This model posits that quantum systems, much like biological organisms, engage in active inference to optimize their processing of information. By minimizing free energy, quantum systems can achieve efficient computation and adapt to their environments.
