# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Patient Experience in Healthcare

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into patient experience frameworks in healthcare. By identifying isomorphisms between these two domains, the research seeks to develop a comprehensive model that enhances patient satisfaction, improves health outcomes, and fosters a holistic approach to care. The study will provide actionable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and educators, ultimately contributing to a paradigm shift in how healthcare services are delivered and perceived.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of guest experience in hospitality and patient experience in healthcare represents a burgeoning area of inquiry. Both fields prioritize service quality, personalization, and the impact of the physical environment on user satisfaction. In hospitality, the guest experience has evolved to encompass not only the quality of service but also the emotional and psychological aspects of the guest's journey. This includes factors such as ambiance, staff interaction, and the overall atmosphere of the hospitality environment.

In healthcare, the patient experience has similarly shifted towards a more patient-centered approach, emphasizing the importance of understanding patients' needs, preferences, and emotional states. However, the application of hospitality principles in healthcare remains underexplored. This gap presents a unique opportunity for innovation, wherein healthcare providers can learn from the hospitality industry's well-established practices to enhance the patient experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on patient care. By applying hospitality-driven strategies to healthcare, the study aims to enhance patient engagement, satisfaction, and overall wellness, thereby addressing critical gaps in current healthcare delivery models. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that not only examines existing frameworks but also proposes new methodologies and practices that can be seamlessly integrated into healthcare settings.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation is guided by the following overarching research questions:

1. How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be effectively transposed to enhance patient experience in healthcare?
2. What are the key isomorphic elements between the two domains that can inform best practices?
3. What frameworks can be developed to measure and improve patient experience based on hospitality standards?

The primary objectives of this research include:

- To identify and analyze the key principles of guest experience in hospitality that can be applied to healthcare.
- To develop a comprehensive model that integrates these principles into patient experience frameworks.
- To provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of hospitality-inspired practices in improving patient satisfaction and health outcomes.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience in hospitality can be traced back to the early 20th century, where the focus was primarily on basic service provision. Over time, influential theories such as the Service Quality Model (SERVQUAL) emerged, emphasizing the importance of service dimensions including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. Key milestones include the introduction of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which allowed for greater personalization and engagement with guests.

#### Patient Experience in Healthcare

The development of patient experience in healthcare has been significantly influenced by the shift towards patient-centered care in the late 20th century. This movement emphasized the importance of treating patients as partners in their care, leading to the establishment of frameworks such as the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH). The focus on patient experience has been further propelled by regulatory changes and the increasing recognition of the correlation between patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Service Quality and Personalization in Hospitality

Existing literature on service quality in hospitality highlights the significance of personalization in enhancing guest satisfaction. Research indicates that tailored experiences lead to increased loyalty and positive word-of-mouth. Moreover, the role of staff training in delivering exceptional service is well-documented, with studies demonstrating that empowered employees are more likely to provide memorable experiences.

#### Paradigms in Patient Experience

In healthcare, current paradigms emphasize the integration of technology and continuity of care. Literature explores how telehealth and mobile health applications can enhance patient engagement, while the importance of communication and empathy in clinician-patient interactions is underscored. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that bridge the gap between these technological advancements and the emotional aspects of patient care.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps exist in the literature regarding the application of hospitality principles in healthcare. The potential for interdisciplinary collaboration is ripe for exploration, particularly in areas such as staff training, environmental design, and service personalization. This research aims to address these gaps by proposing an integrated model that draws on the strengths of both domains.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Models in Hospitality

The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, serves as a foundational theory in hospitality. It posits that service quality is determined by the gap between expectations and perceptions of service. This model has been widely utilized in hospitality research to evaluate and improve service delivery.

#### Patient-Centered Care Models in Healthcare

In healthcare, the Patient-Centered Care (PCC) model emphasizes the importance of understanding the patient's perspective and involving them in decision-making processes. This model promotes a holistic approach to care, considering not only clinical outcomes but also emotional and psychological well-being.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

As the fields of hospitality and healthcare converge, new theoretical constructs are emerging. This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines key elements from both domains. The model will emphasize the significance of personalization, service quality, and environmental factors in enhancing the overall experience for both guests and patients.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model will outline the relationship between guest experience and patient experience, highlighting shared principles such as:

- Personalization: Tailoring experiences to meet individual needs and preferences.
- Service Quality: Ensuring high standards of service delivery through training and quality assurance.
- Healing Environments: Designing spaces that promote comfort, healing, and well-being.

This model will serve as a foundation for the subsequent empirical research.
