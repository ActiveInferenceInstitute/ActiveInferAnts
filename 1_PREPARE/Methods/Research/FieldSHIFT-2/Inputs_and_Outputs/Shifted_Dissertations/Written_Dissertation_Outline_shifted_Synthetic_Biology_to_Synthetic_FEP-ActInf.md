# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Biology (Domain A) and the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (Domain B). Biology encompasses the study of life, evolution, and ecosystems, focusing on the interactions among various organisms and their environments. It seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive ecological dynamics, emphasizing the interconnectedness of species and their habitats. 

In contrast, the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) provide a theoretical framework for understanding how adaptive systems operate. FEP posits that biological organisms strive to minimize free energy, or surprise, through predictive coding and active engagement with their environments. This principle has gained traction in cognitive science and neuroscience, elucidating how organisms anticipate and respond to changes in their surroundings.

This dissertation seeks to synthesize these fields to create a comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems function as predictive models. By examining the interactions between biological principles and cognitive theories, we can gain insights into the adaptive strategies employed by ecosystems in response to environmental changes.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of current ecological models, which often overlook the dynamic interactions within ecosystems. Traditional ecological approaches tend to focus on static relationships and linear models, failing to capture the complexities inherent in ecological systems. By applying the principles of free energy minimization and active inference to biological systems, this dissertation proposes a novel theoretical framework that can enhance our understanding of ecological resilience and stability.

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between biology and cognitive science. By integrating these domains, we can develop new hypotheses and models that account for the intricate dynamics of ecosystems. This framework has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ecological interactions, leading to more effective conservation strategies and biodiversity management practices.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of Biology has seen significant advancements from early classifications of life to modern molecular biology and ecology. The study of ecosystems has transitioned from simplistic models to complex systems theory, recognizing the intricate relationships among species and their environments. Key milestones in biological research include Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution by natural selection, which provided a foundational understanding of species adaptation, and the development of ecological theories that emphasize the interconnectedness of life forms.

The Free Energy Principle has emerged as a unifying theory in cognitive science and neuroscience, proposing that organisms act to minimize surprise. This principle, articulated by Karl Friston and others, posits that living systems are inherently predictive, constantly generating models of their environments to reduce uncertainty. The FEP has implications for understanding behavior, perception, and decision-making processes, highlighting the adaptive nature of organisms in dynamic environments.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current biological research emphasizes the interconnectedness of ecosystems, highlighting the importance of biodiversity and species interactions in maintaining ecological balance. Studies on ecosystem services, trophic dynamics, and resilience have underscored the necessity of preserving diverse biological communities to sustain ecosystem functions.

Conversely, the FEP and AI focus on individual adaptive systems, exploring how organisms interact with their environments to minimize surprise. While these theories have advanced our understanding of cognitive processes, they have not been extensively applied to ecological contexts. This lack of integration has resulted in gaps in understanding complex ecological dynamics and the adaptive strategies employed by ecosystems.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of biological principles with the FEP and AI presents opportunities to develop predictive models that account for the dynamic nature of ecosystems. By synthesizing these perspectives, we can create frameworks that elucidate how ecosystems generate predictions about resource availability, species interactions, and environmental changes. This can lead to a deeper understanding of resilience, stability, and the role of keystone species in ecological systems.

The Shifted Domain offers a unique opportunity to explore how ecosystems function as adaptive systems, employing predictive coding and active inference to navigate environmental uncertainties. By addressing the gaps in current ecological models, this research can contribute to the development of more robust theoretical frameworks that enhance our understanding of ecological interactions.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Biological Theories

Biological theories such as evolution by natural selection, homeostasis, and ecosystem dynamics provide a foundational understanding of how organisms interact with their environments. Evolution by natural selection explains how species adapt to changing conditions, while homeostasis refers to the mechanisms that organisms employ to maintain internal stability despite external fluctuations. Ecosystem dynamics focus on the interactions among species, energy flow, and nutrient cycling, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life forms.

### Cognitive Theories

Cognitive theories, particularly predictive coding and the Free Energy Principle, offer insights into how organisms perceive and respond to their environments. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on discrepancies between expected and actual experiences. The FEP extends this concept to biological systems, suggesting that organisms strive to minimize surprise through active engagement with their surroundings.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

Ecosystem Predictive Models (EPM) represent frameworks that describe how ecosystems generate predictions about resource availability and species interactions. These models incorporate principles of free energy minimization, emphasizing the role of feedback loops and adaptive behaviors in shaping ecological dynamics. EPM provides a lens through which we can understand how ecosystems anticipate changes and respond to environmental pressures.

### Variational Ecosystem Dynamics (VED)

Variational Ecosystem Dynamics (VED) explores how ecosystems minimize variational free energy through energy flow and interactions. This construct emphasizes the importance of energy transfer among trophic levels and the adaptive strategies employed by species to optimize resource utilization. VED offers a theoretical basis for understanding the resilience of ecosystems in the face of environmental perturbations.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines biological principles with the FEP and AI, emphasizing the predictive nature of ecosystems and the role of energy flow in maintaining ecological stability.
