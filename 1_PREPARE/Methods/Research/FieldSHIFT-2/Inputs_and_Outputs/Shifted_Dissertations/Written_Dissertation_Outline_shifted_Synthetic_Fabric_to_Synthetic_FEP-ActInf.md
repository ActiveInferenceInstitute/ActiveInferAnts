# PhD Dissertation: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts (Domain A) with the Free Energy Principle (Domain B). By systematically transposing concepts from textile creation into the framework of adaptive systems, this research aims to develop a novel theoretical model that enhances our understanding of craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural expression. The findings will not only bridge the gap between art and science but also propose practical applications and educational reforms that can revolutionize both fields. The potential impact includes advancing sustainable practices in textiles, enhancing cognitive insights into creative processes, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fabric industry represents a multifaceted ecosystem characterized by creativity, craftsmanship, and sustainability. Historically, textiles have served not only as functional materials but also as cultural artifacts that embody the values and identities of societies. The Free Energy Principle, on the other hand, provides a theoretical framework to understand adaptive behavior in biological systems, positing that living organisms strive to minimize their free energy to maintain a state of equilibrium with their environment. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates these two domains, emphasizing their shared principles of optimization and adaptation. By viewing textile creation through the lens of the Free Energy Principle, we can better understand the cognitive processes involved in craftsmanship and the sustainability practices that are increasingly vital in contemporary society.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it pioneers a new field that combines artistic expression with cognitive science. The novelty lies in the application of the Free Energy Principle to the fabric industry, redefining textiles as adaptive systems that reflect cognitive processes and cultural dynamics. By establishing a dialogue between these domains, this dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how textiles can serve as both functional objects and cognitive artifacts, thereby enriching our grasp of human creativity and environmental sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the practices of textile creation be understood as cognitive functions analogous to predictive coding?
2. In what ways do sustainable textile practices minimize variational free energy in the context of environmental adaptation?
3. How can smart textiles serve as predictive systems that enhance user adaptability?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Fabric Industry and Arts

The fabric industry has a rich history that spans millennia, characterized by the evolution of techniques, materials, and cultural significance. Traditional textile practices, such as weaving, dyeing, and embroidery, have been integral to cultural identity, often reflecting the social, economic, and political contexts of their time. The transition from artisanal craftsmanship to industrial production has profoundly impacted the fabric industry, leading to both opportunities and challenges regarding sustainability and cultural preservation.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, has its roots in thermodynamics and Bayesian inference. This principle posits that biological systems operate by minimizing free energy, which is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual states of the system. Key contributors to this field have expanded its applications beyond biology to include cognitive science, where it has been used to explain perception, action, and learning as processes of predictive coding.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary trends in textile design emphasize sustainability, innovation, and the integration of technology. Practices such as upcycling, zero-waste design, and the use of biodegradable materials are becoming increasingly prevalent. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle has gained traction in cognitive science, offering insights into how organisms adapt to their environments through predictive models. However, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these two fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The existing literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects textile practices with cognitive theories. This presents an opportunity for novel applications of the Free Energy Principle within the fabric industry, particularly in understanding how artisans and designers adapt their practices in response to environmental and cultural changes. By exploring these intersections, this dissertation aims to uncover new insights that can inform both theoretical and practical advancements in the fields of textiles and cognitive science.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Craftsmanship in Textiles

Theories of artistic expression, materiality, and cultural significance underpin the practice of craftsmanship in textiles. Craftsmanship is often associated with skill, creativity, and the ability to manipulate materials to create functional and aesthetic objects. The cultural significance of textiles is evident in their use as symbols of identity, status, and heritage, reflecting the values and beliefs of the societies that produce them.

#### Adaptive Systems

Theoretical constructs from the Free Energy Principle, including predictive coding and active inference, provide a framework for understanding adaptive systems. Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on new information. Active inference extends this concept, suggesting that organisms not only predict but also act to minimize prediction errors, thereby maintaining homeostasis.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Textile Cognition

This dissertation introduces the concept of textile cognition, which conceptualizes textile creation as a cognitive process. This perspective posits that artisans and designers engage in a continuous cycle of prediction, action, and feedback, akin to the processes described by the Free Energy Principle. By framing textile creation as a cognitive function, we can better understand how cultural, environmental, and individual factors influence design choices.

#### Generative Fabric Models

The notion of generative fabric models proposes that fabrics can be viewed as internal representations guiding adaptive behavior. Just as the brain generates models of the external world to inform action, textiles can embody generative principles that reflect the interplay between design, function, and user interaction. This approach opens new avenues for exploring how textiles can adapt to user needs and environmental conditions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model proposed in this dissertation combines craftsmanship, sustainability, and adaptive systems. It illustrates the interplay between textile design and cognitive processes, highlighting how artisans navigate the complexities of materiality, cultural expression, and environmental sustainability. This model serves as a foundation for understanding the broader implications of textile practices within the context of cognitive science and adaptive systems.
