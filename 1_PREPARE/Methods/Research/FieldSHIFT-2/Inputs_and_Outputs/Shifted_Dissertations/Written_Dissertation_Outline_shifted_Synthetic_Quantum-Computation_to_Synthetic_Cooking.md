## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation has its roots in the early 20th century with the development of quantum mechanics. Key breakthroughs, such as the formulation of quantum algorithms by Peter Shor and Lov Grover, have laid the groundwork for the field. Quantum computers leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. The implications of quantum computing extend to various fields, including cryptography, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

#### Cuisine

The historical development of culinary arts is rich and diverse, reflecting cultural significance and regional practices. From the ancient civilizations that first harnessed fire to modern molecular gastronomy, cooking has evolved into an art form that combines science and creativity. Traditional techniques, such as fermentation and sous-vide cooking, have long been informed by empirical knowledge, yet they often lack the rigorous scientific framework that quantum principles can provide.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Quantum Computation

Current research in quantum computation focuses on developing more stable qubits, improving quantum error correction, and exploring new algorithms. Applications of quantum computing are emerging in various sectors, yet challenges remain, particularly regarding scalability and practical implementation.

#### Cuisine

Contemporary culinary trends emphasize innovation, sustainability, and health-consciousness. The role of science in gastronomy has gained traction, with chefs increasingly utilizing techniques informed by food science. However, there remains a gap in the systematic application of scientific principles, particularly those derived from quantum mechanics, to culinary practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The absence of interdisciplinary research connecting quantum mechanics with culinary practices presents a significant opportunity for innovation. By exploring the parallels between these two domains, this dissertation aims to highlight the potential for novel flavor profiles, recipe development, and culinary education that can emerge from this intersection.
