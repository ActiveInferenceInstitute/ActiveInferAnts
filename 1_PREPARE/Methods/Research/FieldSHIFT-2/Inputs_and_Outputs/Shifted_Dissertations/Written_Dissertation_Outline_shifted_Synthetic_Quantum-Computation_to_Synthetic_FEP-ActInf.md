# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Quantum Computation, which utilizes quantum mechanical phenomena to process information, and the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework that explains how biological systems maintain their organization and adapt to their environments. Quantum Computation, founded on the principles of quantum mechanics, allows for the manipulation of information in ways that classical computation cannot achieve, particularly through phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. In contrast, the Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize their free energy, thereby enhancing their adaptability and predictive capabilities.

The convergence of these two fields offers an unprecedented opportunity to rethink adaptive systems through the lens of quantum mechanics. By employing quantum concepts to inform the FEP, we can develop a richer understanding of how organisms, as well as artificial intelligence systems, navigate complex environments and make decisions under uncertainty. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches our theoretical frameworks but also provides practical implications for advancing technology in AI and cognitive science.

By integrating quantum principles with the FEP, the research will challenge traditional models of cognition and decision-making, proposing that the principles of quantum computation can inform our understanding of generative models and predictive coding in living organisms. This novel perspective can lead to enhanced models of cognition that account for the complexities of human and machine learning in dynamic environments.

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging gaps between quantum mechanics, cognitive science, and AI. By proposing a framework that leverages quantum-inspired generative models, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of adaptability and decision-making, contributing to both theoretical advancements and practical applications.
