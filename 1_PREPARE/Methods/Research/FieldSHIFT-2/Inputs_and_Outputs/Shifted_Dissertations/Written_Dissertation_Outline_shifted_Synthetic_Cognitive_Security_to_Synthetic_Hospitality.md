Cognitive security emerged as a response to the increasing complexity of information environments and the vulnerabilities that arise from cognitive biases. Key theories in this domain include the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), which explains how individuals process persuasive information, and the Dual Process Theory, which differentiates between intuitive and analytical thinking. The evolution of cognitive security has been marked by a growing recognition of the need to protect not just physical or digital assets, but also the cognitive processes that underpin decision-making.

#### Guest Experience

Guest experience management has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a focus on basic service delivery to a more nuanced understanding of guest interactions. Historical developments include the rise of customer relationship management (CRM) systems in the 1990s, which allowed for more personalized guest interactions, and the advent of social media, which has transformed how guests share their experiences and influence brand perceptions. The service quality model SERVQUAL has been instrumental in shaping the understanding of guest expectations and satisfaction.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cognitive Security

Contemporary research on cognitive security delves into the impact of misinformation, the role of social media in shaping perceptions, and the psychological underpinnings of cognitive biases. Scholars such as Sunstein (2017) and Lewandowsky et al. (2017) have examined how misinformation can distort public perceptions and influence decision-making processes. Moreover, advancements in technology have led to the development of tools that can help mitigate cognitive biases, such as decision aids and training programs.
