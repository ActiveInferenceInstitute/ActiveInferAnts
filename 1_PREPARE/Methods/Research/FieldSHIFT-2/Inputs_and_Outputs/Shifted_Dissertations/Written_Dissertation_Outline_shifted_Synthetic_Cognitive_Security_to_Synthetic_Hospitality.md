## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of cognitive security and guest experience management represents a novel interdisciplinary approach. Cognitive security, focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation, has traditionally been applied in areas such as cybersecurity and information integrity. This domain emphasizes safeguarding against misinformation and cognitive biases that can distort decision-making. Conversely, guest experience management centers on optimizing every interaction a guest has with a hospitality establishment, from pre-arrival communications to post-stay feedback.

This dissertation will investigate how principles from cognitive security can enhance guest experiences by addressing biases, ensuring data integrity, and fostering collaborative engagement. The intersection of these two fields promises to yield insights that not only improve service quality but also safeguard the cognitive integrity of guests during their interactions with hospitality services.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it introduces a framework that merges cognitive security with guest experience management, an area largely unexplored. By developing an understanding of how cognitive biases affect guest perceptions and interactions, this dissertation will provide a new lens through which to view service quality and personalization in hospitality. 

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which fills existing gaps in literature and offers practical solutions for industry challenges. As the hospitality sector increasingly relies on data-driven decision-making, the integration of cognitive security principles can ensure that guest interactions are not only personalized but also ethically sound, thereby enhancing brand loyalty and trust.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- **Research Question 1**: How does bias awareness training for hospitality staff impact guest satisfaction and service quality?
- **Research Question 2**: What role does AI play in analyzing guest feedback to identify cognitive biases in service delivery?
- **Research Question 3**: How can educating guests on feedback literacy improve engagement and brand loyalty?

The objectives of this dissertation are to:
1. Develop an integrated theoretical model that combines cognitive security principles with guest experience management.
2. Conduct empirical research to test the proposed hypotheses.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for the hospitality industry.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security emerged as a response to the growing concerns over misinformation and its effects on decision-making. Key theories in this domain include the Cognitive Dissonance Theory, which explores the discomfort experienced when holding conflicting beliefs, and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which addresses how individuals process persuasive information. Historically, cognitive security has been applied to areas such as cybersecurity, where protecting information integrity is paramount.

#### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience management has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from a purely transactional approach to a more holistic view that encompasses emotional engagement and personalized service. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), has been foundational in assessing service quality, emphasizing dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cognitive Security

Contemporary research in cognitive security focuses on the impact of cognitive biases, misinformation, and the role of technology in shaping perceptions. Studies have highlighted the importance of awareness and training in mitigating cognitive biases, particularly in high-stakes environments such as healthcare and finance.

#### Guest Experience

Current trends in guest experience management emphasize the use of technology to enhance personalization and service delivery. The rise of AI and big data analytics has transformed how hospitality businesses gather and respond to guest feedback, enabling real-time adjustments to service offerings.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a significant gap in understanding how cognitive security principles can be applied to enhance guest experience management. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring the interplay between cognitive biases and guest interactions, providing a framework for integrating cognitive security into hospitality practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Bias Theory

Cognitive Bias Theory posits that individuals are prone to systematic errors in judgment and decision-making due to inherent biases. These biases can significantly influence guest perceptions and experiences, leading to suboptimal service delivery.

#### Service Quality Models

Service quality models, particularly the SERVQUAL framework, provide a structured approach to assessing service quality in hospitality. These models emphasize the importance of understanding guest expectations and perceptions, which can be informed by cognitive security principles.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Cognitive Guest Experience (CGE)

The Cognitive Guest Experience (CGE) framework integrates cognitive security principles into guest interactions, emphasizing the role of cognitive awareness in shaping perceptions and experiences. This framework posits that by addressing cognitive biases, hospitality establishments can enhance service quality and guest satisfaction.

#### Bias Awareness Training (BAT)

Bias Awareness Training (BAT) is proposed as a framework for training hospitality staff to recognize and mitigate cognitive biases. This training aims to improve staff interactions with guests, fostering a more empathetic and understanding service environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between cognitive security principles and guest experience management. It highlights feedback loops between staff training, guest interactions, and service quality, demonstrating how cognitive awareness can lead to improved outcomes in hospitality.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of cognitive security into guest experience management. This design allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in guest interactions and service delivery.

### Data Collection Methods

#### Surveys

Surveys will be administered to hospitality staff and guests to assess perceptions of service quality and cognitive biases. The survey will include validated scales measuring service quality, guest satisfaction, and cognitive bias awareness.

#### Interviews

In-depth interviews with industry experts will be conducted to gain insights into best practices and challenges in implementing cognitive security principles. These qualitative data will complement the quantitative findings, providing a richer understanding of the issues at hand.

### Analytical Approaches

#### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis will be conducted using software tools such as SPSS or R to analyze survey data. This analysis will identify correlations and patterns related to cognitive biases and service quality.

#### Thematic Analysis

Qualitative data from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, allowing for the extraction of key themes related to cognitive biases and guest experiences. This approach will provide a nuanced understanding of the qualitative dimensions of the research.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will include ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and addressing potential biases in data collection. The research will adhere to the ethical guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
