# PhD Dissertation: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Ecosystem Dynamics

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from cognitive and biological sciences with Ecosystem Dynamics, creating a Shifted Domain that offers a novel perspective on ecological interactions and resilience. By framing ecosystems as adaptive systems that minimize variational free energy through biodiversity and interspecies interactions, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem stability and functionality. The anticipated impact of this work extends to ecological management, conservation practices, and interdisciplinary education, ultimately contributing to sustainable environmental practices in the face of global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), primarily articulated by Friston (2010), posits that all adaptive systems, including biological organisms and cognitive processes, strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain functional integrity. This principle has been predominantly applied within the realms of neuroscience and physiology, elucidating how living organisms predict and adapt to their environments. Ecosystems, characterized by complex interactions among diverse species and their abiotic environment, can be viewed through this lens, revealing deeper insights into their dynamics and resilience. 

In this dissertation, ecosystems are conceptualized as adaptive systems that engage in a continuous process of free energy minimization, which is operationalized through biodiversity and interspecies interactions. By adopting this perspective, we can better understand how ecosystems maintain stability and functionality in the face of environmental perturbations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This dissertation introduces a groundbreaking perspective by transposing principles from the FEP to ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the parallels between individual and collective adaptive behaviors in biological and ecological systems. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging cognitive science and ecology, and offering a fresh framework for understanding ecological stability. 

The implications of this work are profound, as it promises to enhance our understanding of biodiversity's role in ecosystem resilience, thereby informing conservation strategies and ecological management practices. By framing ecosystems through the lens of free energy minimization, this research contributes to the development of sustainable environmental practices, particularly in the context of pressing global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be systematically applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. What are the implications of viewing ecosystems as systems that minimize free energy for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management?
3. How can generative models be developed to predict ecosystem responses to environmental changes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle and its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the statistical mechanics of thermodynamics and Bayesian inference. At its core, it posits that biological systems are driven to minimize surprise, or free energy, by optimizing their internal models of the world (Friston, 2010). This principle has profound implications for understanding adaptive behavior, as it suggests that organisms actively infer the causes of sensory inputs and update their beliefs about the world to reduce uncertainty.

#### Examination of Ecosystem Dynamics

Ecosystem dynamics encompass the complex interactions between organisms and their environment, characterized by energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species interactions. Key concepts in this field include biodiversity, which refers to the variety of life forms within a given ecosystem, and resilience, the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbances while maintaining its structure and function (Holling, 1973). Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective conservation and management strategies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Recent Advancements in FEP Research

Recent advancements in research surrounding the Free Energy Principle have expanded its applicability to various domains, including active inference and generative models. Active inference posits that organisms engage in a continuous process of hypothesis testing and model updating to minimize prediction error (Friston et al., 2017). Generative models, on the other hand, are probabilistic frameworks that allow for the simulation of complex adaptive behaviors, offering valuable insights into how systems respond to environmental changes.

#### Review of Contemporary Ecological Theories

Contemporary ecological theories, such as the Stability-Complexity Hypothesis and the Niche Theory, provide frameworks for understanding species interactions and ecosystem stability. These theories emphasize the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health and resilience, aligning with the principles of the FEP, which posits that diversity can enhance a system's ability to minimize free energy.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

While significant advancements have been made in both cognitive science and ecology, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges these fields. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring the potential for new theoretical frameworks and practical applications arising from the integration of the FEP and ecosystem dynamics. By establishing a Shifted Domain, this research aims to illuminate the interconnectedness of cognitive and ecological systems, ultimately enhancing our understanding of adaptive behaviors in both domains.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Overview of Key Theories in the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several foundational theories, including active inference and entropy minimization. Active inference suggests that organisms continuously update their internal models to align with sensory inputs, thereby minimizing prediction error. Entropy minimization, a core aspect of the FEP, posits that systems naturally evolve toward states of lower entropy, which correspond to higher order and organization.

#### Discussion of Ecological Theories Related to Biodiversity, Keystone Species, and Resilience

Ecological theories emphasize the significance of biodiversity and keystone species in maintaining ecosystem stability. The concept of keystone species, introduced by Paine (1969), refers to species that have a disproportionately large impact on their environment relative to their abundance. Biodiversity, in turn, enhances ecosystem resilience by providing functional redundancy, which allows ecosystems to withstand disturbances and recover from perturbations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Introduction of Concepts such as Ecosystem Free Energy and Ecological Active Inference

This dissertation proposes new theoretical constructs that emerge from the integration of the FEP and ecosystem dynamics. Ecosystem Free Energy is defined as the collective free energy associated with the interactions among species within an ecosystem, while Ecological Active Inference refers to the processes by which ecosystems adapt and respond to environmental changes through the minimization of free energy.

#### Development of an Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, illustrating the interactions between biodiversity, energy flow, and free energy minimization in ecosystems. This model serves as a conceptual framework for understanding how ecosystems function as adaptive systems, emphasizing the role of biodiversity in facilitating resilience and stability.
