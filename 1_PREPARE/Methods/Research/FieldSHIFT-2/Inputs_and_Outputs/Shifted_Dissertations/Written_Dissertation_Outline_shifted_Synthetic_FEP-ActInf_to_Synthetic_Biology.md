# PhD Dissertation: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Ecosystem Dynamics

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from cognitive and biological sciences with Ecosystem Dynamics, creating a Shifted Domain that offers a novel perspective on ecological interactions and resilience. By framing ecosystems as adaptive systems that minimize variational free energy through biodiversity and interspecies interactions, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem stability and functionality. The anticipated impact of this work extends to ecological management, conservation practices, and interdisciplinary education, ultimately contributing to sustainable environmental practices in the face of global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that all adaptive systems, including biological organisms and ecosystems, strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain functional integrity. This principle, rooted in statistical mechanics, suggests that systems evolve to reduce uncertainty about their environment. Ecosystems, characterized by complex interactions and interdependencies among species, can be viewed through this lens, revealing deeper insights into their dynamics and resilience. Viewing ecosystems as adaptive systems that engage in free energy minimization allows for a richer understanding of biodiversity's role in maintaining ecological balance.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This dissertation introduces a groundbreaking perspective by transposing principles from the FEP to ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the parallels between individual and collective adaptive behaviors in biological and ecological systems. The innovative application of FEP to ecology not only enhances our understanding of ecological stability but also provides a theoretical foundation for developing conservation strategies that align with natural processes. By framing ecosystems as systems that actively minimize free energy, we can better appreciate the intricate relationships that sustain biodiversity and resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be systematically applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. What are the implications of viewing ecosystems as systems that minimize free energy for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management?
3. How can generative models be developed to predict ecosystem responses to environmental changes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) has its roots in the works of Helmholtz and later developments in statistical mechanics. It provides a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of complex adaptive systems by asserting that these systems, including biological organisms, strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. In parallel, ecosystem dynamics have been studied through various lenses, including biodiversity, energy flow, and resilience theories. Notable ecological frameworks, such as the Stability Theory and the Ecosystem Services Framework, emphasize the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functionality and resilience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in FEP research have introduced concepts such as active inference, which describes how organisms predict sensory input to minimize surprise or uncertainty. In ecology, contemporary theories have focused on the role of biodiversity in ecosystem stability, emphasizing the importance of keystone species and the interconnectedness of ecological networks. However, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research bridging cognitive science and ecology, which this dissertation aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research that connects the cognitive and ecological domains presents an opportunity to develop new theoretical frameworks and practical applications. By integrating the principles of FEP into ecosystem dynamics, we can foster a deeper understanding of ecological interactions and resilience, paving the way for innovative conservation strategies and ecosystem management practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key theories, including active inference, which posits that organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world to minimize prediction errors. This framework can be extended to ecosystems, where species interact in ways that reduce uncertainty about their environment. In ecology, theories related to biodiversity, such as the Rivet Hypothesis and the Redundancy Hypothesis, provide insight into how species diversity contributes to ecosystem resilience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new theoretical constructs such as Ecosystem Free Energy and Ecological Active Inference. Ecosystem Free Energy refers to the collective free energy minimization strategies employed by species within an ecosystem. Ecological Active Inference describes how species adapt their behaviors and interactions based on predictions about environmental changes. These constructs serve as foundational elements for developing an integrated theoretical model that combines insights from both domains.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interactions between biodiversity, energy flow, and free energy minimization in ecosystems. This model posits that diverse ecosystems are more adept at minimizing free energy due to their ability to leverage a wider array of species interactions and functional traits. A visual representation of this model will be provided, highlighting the feedback loops and dynamic relationships that characterize ecosystem functioning.

## Methodology

Data collection will involve field studies to assess biodiversity and ecosystem stability across various habitats. Surveys and interviews with ecologists and conservation practitioners will provide qualitative insights into the practical applications of the proposed theoretical framework. Additionally, ecological data will be gathered from existing databases and literature to support model development.

### Analytical Approaches

Generative modeling techniques will be applied to simulate ecosystem dynamics, allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and predictions regarding ecosystem responses to environmental changes. Statistical analyses will evaluate the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, employing methods such as regression analysis and structural equation modeling.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process, ensuring the ethical treatment of ecological research subjects and compliance with environmental regulations. Potential biases in data collection and analysis will be addressed through rigorous methodological frameworks and transparency in reporting.
