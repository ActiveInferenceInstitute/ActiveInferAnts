## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of health care and blockchain technology, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Health care focuses on patient experience, service quality, and technological integration, while blockchain emphasizes decentralization, security, and transaction integrity. This dissertation will analyze how principles from health care can be transposed into blockchain to improve user engagement and operational efficiency. 

Historically, health care has struggled with issues such as fragmented patient data, lack of transparency, and inadequate patient engagement. Similarly, blockchain technology faces challenges related to user adoption, complexity, and perceived value. By merging these domains, the dissertation proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of both fields to create a more holistic approach to user experience and service delivery.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both fields. In health care, there is a growing need for improved patient engagement and personalized care. Traditional models often overlook the importance of user feedback and adaptability, leading to suboptimal health outcomes. In blockchain, user adoption and satisfaction remain challenges, with many applications failing to resonate with end-users. 

By integrating concepts from health care into blockchain, this dissertation proposes a novel approach that enhances both user experience and service quality, ultimately benefiting both sectors. The research will explore how user-centered design principles can inform blockchain development, leading to more effective and engaging applications.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can user feedback mechanisms from health care improve blockchain application development?
2. What are the impacts of adaptive smart contracts on user engagement and compliance in decentralized applications?
3. How can sustainability practices in blockchain influence user trust and community engagement?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of patient-centered care has been marked by a shift from provider-centric models to frameworks that prioritize patient needs and preferences. Key milestones include the introduction of the biopsychosocial model, which emphasizes the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors in health care delivery. Additionally, service quality frameworks, such as the SERVQUAL model, have been instrumental in assessing and improving patient experiences.

#### Blockchain

Blockchain technology emerged from the desire for secure, decentralized transactions, with Bitcoin as its first application. The foundational principles of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—have since been adapted for various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and health care. Understanding these principles is crucial for exploring their application in enhancing health care delivery.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Health Care

Existing literature on patient engagement strategies highlights the importance of communication, shared decision-making, and the use of technology to facilitate interactions between patients and providers. Technology adoption in health care has also been a focal point, with studies examining the barriers and facilitators to the integration of digital health solutions.

#### Blockchain

Current blockchain applications range from secure health records to supply chain transparency. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, are critical in ensuring transaction integrity. The role of smart contracts in automating processes and enhancing transparency is also well-documented, yet their potential in health care remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals significant gaps in user engagement and satisfaction within blockchain applications. Many projects fail to incorporate user feedback, resulting in products that do not meet user needs. Conversely, the application of health care principles, such as patient-centered care and service quality metrics, presents opportunities to enhance blockchain functionality and user experience. This research aims to bridge these gaps by proposing an integrated approach that draws on the strengths of both domains.
