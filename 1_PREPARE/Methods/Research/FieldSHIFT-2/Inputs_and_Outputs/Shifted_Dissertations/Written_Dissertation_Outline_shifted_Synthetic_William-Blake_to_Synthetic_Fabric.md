## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a visionary artist, poet, and printmaker whose work transcended the boundaries of traditional art forms. His philosophy centered on the power of imagination, the significance of duality, and the critique of societal norms. Blake's emphasis on the imaginative process as a means of accessing deeper truths is particularly relevant in the context of textile design, where creativity can be harnessed to challenge conventions and inspire innovation.

#### The Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has undergone significant transformations over the centuries, evolving from artisanal craftsmanship to mass production systems characterized by fast fashion. This evolution has led to a disconnection between the maker and the material, raising concerns about sustainability, cultural heritage, and the loss of artistic integrity in textile production. The rise of fast fashion has not only contributed to environmental degradation but has also diluted the narrative potential of textiles, reducing them to mere commodities.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Artistic Expression in Textiles

Current trends in textile design reflect a growing awareness of sustainability and cultural heritage. Designers are increasingly exploring the intersection of art and textile production, utilizing innovative techniques and materials to create works that resonate with contemporary societal issues. This shift presents an opportunity to integrate Blakean principles, emphasizing the role of imagination and narrative in textile design.

#### Blake's Influence on Art and Literature

Scholarly interpretations of Blake's work have highlighted its relevance to contemporary artistic practices. His exploration of themes such as duality, social critique, and the transformative power of imagination has inspired artists across various disciplines. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the application of Blake's principles specifically within the fabric industry.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This literature review identifies a lack of interdisciplinary approaches in textile design that incorporate literary and artistic influences. By exploring the potential for integrating Blakean principles into modern fabric arts, this research aims to fill this gap and highlight the opportunities for innovation and artistic expression within the textile industry.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Imagination and Vision

The role of imagination in artistic creation is paramount. Blake believed that imagination was not merely a faculty of the mind but a spiritual force that could transform reality. This perspective can inform textile design, encouraging designers to tap into their creative potential to produce works that resonate on a deeper level.

#### Duality and Contraries

Blake's exploration of duality and the coexistence of opposites is a significant philosophical underpinning of his work. This concept can be applied to textile design, where contrasting elements—such as texture, color, and form—can be harmoniously integrated to create dynamic and thought-provoking pieces.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Narrative Textiles

Conceptualizing textiles as a medium for storytelling opens new avenues for artistic expression. Textiles can convey narratives that reflect cultural identities, historical contexts, and personal experiences, allowing for a deeper engagement with the viewer.

#### Spiritual Crafting

The integration of spirituality into fabric production emphasizes the personal and emotional dimensions of textile arts. This approach encourages artists to connect with their materials on a spiritual level, fostering a sense of mindfulness and intentionality in their creative processes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that connects Blake’s principles with contemporary textile practices. This model emphasizes the importance of narrative, sustainability, and personal expression, providing a framework for artists and designers to explore the intersection of art and fabric.
