# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Chemistry

Chemistry has evolved from ancient alchemical practices to a robust scientific discipline focused on the properties, composition, and transformations of matter. Key historical milestones include the development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev, advancements in organic chemistry through the work of chemists like August Kekulé, and the emergence of green chemistry, which emphasizes sustainable practices in chemical research and production.

### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience has transitioned from a focus on basic service delivery to a comprehensive understanding of customer interactions, driven by technology and personalization. Historical developments include the rise of customer service management in the mid-20th century, the integration of technology through online booking systems, and the emergence of customer relationship management (CRM) systems that allow for a more nuanced understanding of guest preferences. The evolution of these concepts highlights the growing importance of personalized service in the hospitality industry.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Chemistry

Current trends in Chemistry emphasize sustainability, computational modeling, and the development of new materials. Research focuses on understanding molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms, with an increasing emphasis on the role of catalysts in facilitating reactions. The move towards green chemistry has led to innovations that minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency.

### Guest Experience

The hospitality industry is increasingly adopting technology to enhance guest experiences, with a focus on personalization, consistency, and real-time feedback mechanisms. However, many challenges remain, including balancing technology with human interaction. The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning in service delivery presents both opportunities and challenges, as businesses strive to maintain a human touch in an increasingly automated environment.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

While both fields have made significant strides, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects the systematic methodologies of Chemistry with the experiential nature of hospitality. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation by applying chemical concepts to enhance guest interactions. By examining guest experiences through a scientific lens, this research aims to fill existing gaps and propose practical solutions for the hospitality industry.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Chemical Reactions**: Understanding how substances interact and transform is fundamental to both Chemistry and the guest experience. In hospitality, each interaction can be viewed as a reaction where various factors influence the outcome.
   
2. **Catalysis**: The role of catalysts in accelerating reactions without being consumed parallels the tools and processes in hospitality that enhance service delivery without detracting from the core experience.

3. **Chemical Equilibrium**: The balance between reactants and products can be likened to the balancing act in hospitality between guest satisfaction and operational efficiency.

4. **Reaction Kinetics**: The study of rates of reactions can inform the timing and pacing of service delivery in hospitality, ensuring that guest needs are met promptly.

5. **Thermodynamics**: The energy changes involved in chemical processes can be related to the emotional energy exchanged during guest interactions.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Guest Reaction Dynamics**: Viewing guest interactions as transformative processes that can be influenced by various factors, akin to chemical reactions.

2. **Service Catalysis**: Identifying tools and processes that enhance service delivery, similar to how catalysts improve reaction rates without being consumed.

3. **Experience Equilibrium**: Balancing various elements of service to maintain guest satisfaction, akin to achieving equilibrium in chemical reactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model integrates chemical principles with guest experience elements, illustrating how each guest interaction can be analyzed as a chemical reaction, with service processes acting as catalysts that influence the outcome. This model serves as a basis for developing practical applications and frameworks that hospitality professionals can utilize to enhance guest satisfaction.
