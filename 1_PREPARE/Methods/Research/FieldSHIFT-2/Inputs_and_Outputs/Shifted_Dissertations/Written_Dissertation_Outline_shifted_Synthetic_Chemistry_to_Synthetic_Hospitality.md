# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Chemistry

Chemistry has evolved from ancient alchemical practices to a robust scientific discipline focused on the properties, composition, and transformations of matter. Key historical milestones include the development of the periodic table, advancements in organic chemistry, and the emergence of green chemistry. The systematic study of chemical reactions has allowed scientists to predict and manipulate the behavior of substances, leading to innovations in various fields including pharmaceuticals, materials science, and environmental sustainability.

### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience has transitioned from a focus on basic service delivery to a comprehensive understanding of customer interactions, driven by technology and personalization. Historical developments include the rise of customer service management and the integration of technology in hospitality. The evolution of this concept reflects a broader shift towards recognizing the value of customer satisfaction as a key driver of business success. 

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Chemistry

Current trends in Chemistry emphasize sustainability, computational modeling, and the development of new materials. Research focuses on understanding molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms, with an increasing emphasis on how these principles can be applied to solve real-world problems. The advancement of analytical techniques and computational methods has transformed the field, allowing for more precise predictions and innovative applications.

### Guest Experience

The hospitality industry is increasingly adopting technology to enhance guest experiences, with a focus on personalization, consistency, and real-time feedback mechanisms. However, many challenges remain, including balancing technology with human interaction. The advent of artificial intelligence and data analytics has opened new avenues for understanding guest preferences and behaviors, yet the importance of emotional and social dimensions in guest experiences cannot be overlooked.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

While both fields have made significant strides, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects the systematic methodologies of Chemistry with the experiential nature of hospitality. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation by applying chemical concepts to enhance guest interactions. By bridging these two domains, this research seeks to uncover new insights and develop practical applications that can lead to improved service delivery and guest satisfaction.
