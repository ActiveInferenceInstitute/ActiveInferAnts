## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Negotiation has traditionally been viewed as a competitive process, often focused on distributive strategies and power dynamics. Classic negotiation theories, such as Fisher and Ury's principled negotiation, emphasize interests over positions, yet they often neglect the emotional and cultural dimensions that significantly influence negotiation outcomes. Recent developments in interdisciplinary research reveal the need for a more nuanced approach that incorporates emotional and cultural intelligence. Emotional intelligence (EI), defined as the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one’s own emotions while also recognizing and influencing the emotions of others, plays a crucial role in fostering collaborative negotiation environments. Similarly, cultural intelligence (CQ), which refers to an individual’s capability to function effectively in culturally diverse settings, is increasingly recognized as a vital component in successful negotiations, especially in our globalized world.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its systematic integration of emotional intelligence and cultural adaptability into negotiation frameworks. By reimagining negotiation as a collaborative process, this dissertation aims to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of negotiation strategies across diverse contexts. The integration of these two forms of intelligence not only enriches the negotiation process but also introduces a transformative perspective that can lead to more sustainable and mutually beneficial outcomes. This work seeks to fill the existing gaps in literature and practice by providing a robust theoretical foundation and practical applications that can be implemented across various sectors.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How does emotional intelligence influence negotiation outcomes?
2. In what ways can cultural adaptability enhance negotiation effectiveness?
3. What new pedagogical approaches can be developed to teach these integrated concepts in negotiation training?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

Negotiation theories and practices have evolved significantly over the past century. Early theories, such as the distributive bargaining model, focused on competition and the zero-sum nature of negotiations. As the field progressed, interest-based negotiation emerged, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying interests and fostering cooperation. This historical context is essential for understanding the limitations of traditional approaches and the need for a more holistic framework that incorporates emotional and cultural dimensions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current literature on negotiation predominantly revolves around strategies, tactics, and outcomes, with limited attention given to the emotional and cultural factors at play. Emotional intelligence has been extensively studied in various contexts, revealing its impact on interpersonal relationships, leadership, and team dynamics. Similarly, cultural intelligence has gained traction in cross-cultural communication and international business. However, the intersection of these two fields in the context of negotiation remains underexplored, presenting a significant opportunity for research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of integration between emotional and cultural intelligence in negotiation frameworks presents a critical gap in the literature. Existing negotiation models often overlook the emotional dynamics that can influence decision-making and relationship-building. Additionally, the cultural nuances that shape negotiation styles and expectations are frequently ignored. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing an interdisciplinary collaboration that combines insights from psychology, sociology, and conflict resolution to develop a more comprehensive understanding of negotiation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

A review of foundational theories reveals key concepts that underpin negotiation practices. Interest-based negotiation, as articulated by Fisher and Ury, emphasizes the importance of focusing on interests rather than positions. Communication theories, such as the Social Penetration Theory, highlight the role of self-disclosure and trust in building relationships. Conflict resolution models, including the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, provide insights into different conflict-handling styles and their implications for negotiation outcomes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces several new theoretical constructs that emerge from the integration of emotional and cultural intelligence in negotiation:

1. **Emotional Regulation Hypothesis**: This hypothesis posits that negotiators with high emotional intelligence are better equipped to regulate their emotions, leading to more favorable negotiation outcomes.
   
2. **Cultural Adaptability Theory**: This theory suggests that negotiators who possess high cultural intelligence can better navigate cultural differences, resulting in enhanced communication and collaboration.

3. **Collaborative Networks Model**: This model emphasizes the importance of building collaborative networks among negotiators, highlighting the role of emotional and cultural intelligence in fostering trust and cooperation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines emotional and cultural intelligence as central components of effective negotiation. This model posits that negotiators who are emotionally intelligent and culturally adaptable are more likely to achieve successful outcomes. The model also suggests that training in these areas can enhance negotiators' skills, leading to improved relationships and long-term success.
