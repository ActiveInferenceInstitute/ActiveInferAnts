## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of the Evolution of ATM Technology and Its Impact on Financial Transactions
The development of ATM technology has revolutionized the banking industry since its inception in the late 1960s. Initially designed to provide basic banking services, ATMs have evolved to include advanced functionalities such as cash deposits, transfers, and account management. This evolution has led to increased efficiency in financial transactions, reduced operational costs for banks, and improved customer satisfaction. The principles of clarity, security, and user autonomy inherent in ATM transactions provide a foundation for understanding how similar structures can enhance negotiation practices.

#### Historical Perspectives on Negotiation Theories and Practices
Negotiation, as a discipline, has evolved significantly over the last century, with contributions from various fields such as psychology, economics, and sociology. Early theories focused on distributive bargaining, where the negotiation was seen as a zero-sum game. Over time, integrative approaches emerged, emphasizing collaboration and mutual gain. Key figures such as Fisher and Ury introduced concepts like BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) and ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement), which have become foundational in contemporary negotiation theory. Understanding these historical perspectives is essential for contextualizing the proposed integration of ATM principles into negotiation practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Examination of Recent Advancements in ATM Transaction Design and User Experience
Recent advancements in ATM design focus on enhancing user experience through intuitive interfaces, personalization, and security features. Studies have shown that user-centric design can significantly impact user satisfaction and engagement (Hassenzahl, 2010). The incorporation of real-time feedback mechanisms into ATM transactions, such as transaction confirmations and alerts, has further improved user autonomy and trust in the process. These advancements provide a model for how similar principles can be applied to negotiation platforms.

#### Analysis of Contemporary Negotiation Strategies, Including Distributive and Integrative Approaches
Contemporary negotiation strategies encompass a range of approaches, from competitive bargaining to collaborative problem-solving. The integrative approach, in particular, emphasizes the importance of understanding the interests and needs of all parties involved. This approach aligns with user-centric design principles, as it seeks to create value for all stakeholders rather than merely dividing existing resources. However, challenges such as power imbalances and emotional dynamics often hinder effective negotiation. The integration of ATM transaction principles may provide solutions to these challenges by promoting structured, transparent processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
#### Identification of Gaps in Current Negotiation Theories That Could Benefit from a Structured, User-Centric Approach
Despite advancements in negotiation theory, there remains a lack of structured methodologies that prioritize user experience and clarity. Current theories often overlook the importance of process design and fail to address the emotional dynamics that can complicate negotiations. By examining the structured nature of ATM transactions, this research seeks to fill these gaps and provide a framework that enhances negotiation practices.

#### Exploration of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research Connecting ATM Transaction Principles with Negotiation Practices
The intersection of ATM transaction principles and negotiation practices has not been extensively explored in existing literature. This gap presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from both fields to develop innovative strategies for negotiation. By drawing on the principles of transaction design, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm for negotiation that enhances outcomes and fosters ethical practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Transactional Analysis in Financial Contexts
Transactional analysis, originally developed by Eric Berne, provides a framework for understanding interactions and transactions between individuals. In financial contexts, this theory can be applied to analyze the dynamics of ATM transactions, where users engage with the machine in a structured manner. By understanding the transactional nature of these interactions, we can glean insights into how similar principles can be applied to negotiation processes.

#### Negotiation Theory, Including Key Concepts Such as BATNA and ZOPA
Negotiation theory encompasses various concepts that inform effective negotiation strategies. BATNA refers to the best alternative available to a negotiator if an agreement cannot be reached, while ZOPA represents the range within which an agreement is possible. These concepts are crucial for understanding the dynamics of negotiation and can be integrated into the proposed framework by establishing clear transaction flows and user-centric designs that enhance clarity and decision-making.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Integration of User Experience Design Principles into Negotiation Frameworks
The integration of user experience design principles into negotiation frameworks represents a significant shift in how negotiations are approached. By prioritizing user needs and preferences, negotiators can create environments that foster collaboration and engagement. This approach aligns with the principles of ATM transactions, where user experience is paramount.

#### Development of Trust-Building Protocols Based on Security Measures from ATM Transactions
Trust is a critical component of successful negotiations. The security measures inherent in ATM transactions, such as encryption and authentication, provide a model for developing trust-building protocols in negotiation contexts. By establishing clear guidelines for ethical behavior and transparency, negotiators can foster trust and improve outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model combines transaction flows, user-centric design, and trust protocols into a cohesive framework for negotiation. This model emphasizes the importance of structured processes, user engagement, and ethical practices in enhancing negotiation outcomes. By applying this model to real-world negotiation scenarios, this research aims to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving both efficiency and satisfaction.
