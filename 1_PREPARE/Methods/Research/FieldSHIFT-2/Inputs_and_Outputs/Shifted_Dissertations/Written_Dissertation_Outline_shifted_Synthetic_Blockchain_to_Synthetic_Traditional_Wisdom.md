## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain Technology:** The development of blockchain technology can be traced back to the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The core principles of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—have since evolved, leading to a myriad of applications across various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and healthcare. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application of blockchain technology in cultural heritage preservation, driven by the need for secure, tamper-proof documentation of cultural assets.

- **Traditional Knowledge:** Traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom, practices, and beliefs that are developed and passed down within indigenous communities. This knowledge is often transmitted orally and is deeply intertwined with the cultural identity of the community. However, traditional knowledge systems face numerous challenges, including loss due to globalization, misrepresentation, and exploitation. Existing preservation efforts, such as documentation projects and cultural heritage initiatives, often fall short of adequately protecting the rights and interests of indigenous communities.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- A review of existing blockchain applications reveals a growing body of literature exploring its potential in various sectors. In the context of cultural preservation, projects such as Everledger and Artory have emerged, utilizing blockchain to document provenance and ownership of art and cultural artifacts. However, these projects often lack direct engagement with indigenous communities, raising questions about the ethical implications of such applications.

- Traditional knowledge preservation efforts have included initiatives like the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Traditional Knowledge Division, which aims to protect indigenous rights. However, these efforts often struggle with bureaucratic challenges and fail to empower communities adequately.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
This literature review highlights a significant gap in the integration between blockchain technology and traditional knowledge. While both fields have developed independently, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research exploring how blockchain can be utilized to address the challenges faced by traditional knowledge systems. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for innovation through the application of blockchain technology, ultimately leading to more sustainable and equitable models for cultural heritage management.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain Theory:** The principles of decentralization, transparency, and security form the foundation of blockchain technology. Decentralization ensures that no single entity has control over the data, promoting trust among users. Transparency allows for the verification of transactions, while immutability guarantees that once information is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. These principles make blockchain an ideal technology for preserving traditional knowledge, as they provide a secure and trustworthy platform for documentation.

- **Cultural Theory:** Cultural theory encompasses concepts of knowledge transmission, cultural identity, and community empowerment. The transmission of traditional knowledge is often a communal process, relying on oral histories and collective memory. Cultural identity is closely tied to the practices and beliefs of a community, making the preservation of traditional knowledge essential for maintaining cultural integrity and resilience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cultural Resilience Theory:** This theory posits that technology can enhance the resilience of traditional knowledge systems by providing tools for documentation, sharing, and management. By utilizing blockchain technology, communities can develop robust systems that protect their cultural heritage while adapting to contemporary challenges.

- **Decentralized Cultural Economy:** This framework seeks to understand the economic implications of tokenizing traditional practices. By creating digital tokens that represent traditional knowledge, communities can establish new economic models that recognize and compensate them for their cultural contributions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integrated theoretical model proposed in this dissertation illustrates the interaction between blockchain technology and traditional knowledge systems. This model emphasizes the importance of community engagement and collaboration in developing decentralized platforms that empower indigenous communities to manage and preserve their cultural heritage effectively.
