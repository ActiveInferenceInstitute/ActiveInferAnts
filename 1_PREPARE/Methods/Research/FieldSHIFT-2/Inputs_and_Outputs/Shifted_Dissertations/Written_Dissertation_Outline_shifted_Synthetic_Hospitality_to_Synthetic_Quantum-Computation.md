## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of guest experience in hospitality has been shaped by changing consumer expectations, technological advancements, and a growing emphasis on sustainability. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry in the late 1980s, remains a cornerstone of service quality research, outlining key dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions have been instrumental in guiding hospitality businesses towards enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty.

In parallel, quantum computation has emerged from theoretical physics, evolving through advancements in quantum mechanics and computational theory. The field has transitioned from abstract concepts to practical applications, with significant investments from both the public and private sectors. However, the complexity of quantum algorithms and the technical nature of quantum systems can create barriers to user engagement, necessitating a focus on user experience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current literature highlights the importance of user experience in technology adoption, particularly in complex fields such as quantum computing. Research indicates that user satisfaction is closely linked to the perceived usability and accessibility of technology. However, there is limited exploration of how principles from hospitality can inform and improve these experiences. Most studies in quantum computing focus on algorithm performance and technical advancements, overlooking the critical role of user engagement and satisfaction.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The existing literature lacks an integrated approach that combines user experience principles from hospitality with the technical demands of quantum computation. This gap presents an opportunity to develop a new framework that enhances user interaction and satisfaction in quantum technologies.
