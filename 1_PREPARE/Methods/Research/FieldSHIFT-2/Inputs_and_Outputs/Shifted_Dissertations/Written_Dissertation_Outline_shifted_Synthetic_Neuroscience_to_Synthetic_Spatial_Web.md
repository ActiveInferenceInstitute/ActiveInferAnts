## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The advent of digital technologies has fundamentally altered how individuals interact with their environments, both physical and virtual. The **Shifted Domain** represents a fusion of two previously distinct fields: neuroscience and the Spatial Web. Neuroscience focuses on understanding the brain's structure and functions, while the Spatial Web integrates digital and physical spaces through technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these domains, proposing a framework that draws on neural principles to inform the design of adaptive digital environments.

The integration of neuroscience into the Spatial Web offers a unique opportunity to create systems that not only respond to user inputs but also learn from them, thereby enhancing user experience and engagement. By understanding how the human brain processes information, we can design interfaces that align with cognitive functions, leading to more intuitive interactions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

The evolution of neuroscience has transitioned from early anatomical studies, which focused on the structure of the brain, to modern computational models that emphasize the dynamic processes underlying cognition. Pioneering work by figures such as Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal laid the foundation for our understanding of neural circuitry, while advancements in neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to visualize brain activity in real-time. This historical context is crucial for understanding the principles of neural plasticity and cognitive processing that inform the proposed framework.

This dissertation aims to fill that gap by proposing a framework that integrates neuroscience with the Spatial Web.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of neuroscience into the Spatial Web presents numerous opportunities for research and development. One significant gap is the lack of adaptive systems that respond to user behavior in real-time. By leveraging principles of synaptic plasticity and neural network architectures, this research aims to create interfaces that not only learn from user interactions but also optimize their performance based on cognitive processes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Key theories in neuroscience, such as **neural plasticity** and **cognitive processing**, provide a foundation for understanding how the brain adapts to new information and experiences. Neural plasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, which is crucial for learning and memory. Cognitive processing theories explain how information is perceived, processed, and stored, offering insights into how users interact with digital environments.

#### Spatial Web

In the Spatial Web, theories of **user experience design** and **data integration** are pivotal. User experience design emphasizes the importance of creating interfaces that are intuitive and responsive to user needs, while data integration theories focus on how disparate data sources can be combined to create cohesive user experiences. These theories will inform the design principles of the proposed neuro-inspired framework.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The intersection of neuroscience and the Spatial Web gives rise to new theoretical constructs that focus on **adaptive systems** and **cognitive mapping**. Adaptive systems are designed to learn from user interactions and adjust their functionality accordingly, while cognitive mapping refers to the organization and representation of information in a way that aligns with human cognitive processes. These constructs will be central to the development of the proposed framework.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines insights from neuroscience and the Spatial Web. The model posits that by understanding neural mechanisms of learning and memory, we can design adaptive technologies that enhance user engagement and optimize data processing.
