## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Neuroscience**: The field of neuroscience has undergone significant transformations, with key milestones such as the discovery of synaptic plasticity by Donald Hebb, which posits that the strength of synapses is modifiable based on experience. This concept has become foundational in understanding learning and memory processes across various species. Additionally, the identification of neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, and octopamine, has shed light on the biochemical underpinnings of behavior.

- **Entomology**: Historical developments in entomology have highlighted the ecological and evolutionary significance of insects. Pioneering studies by entomologists like Karl von Frisch, who elucidated the complex communication systems of bees, laid the groundwork for understanding insect behavior in a social context. Recent advancements in molecular techniques have further enriched our understanding of insect physiology and ecology, yet the integration of these insights with neuroscience remains underexplored.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Recent advancements in neuroscience have focused on neural networks and their role in cognition, emphasizing the importance of understanding how interconnected neurons process information. Studies utilizing advanced imaging techniques, such as functional MRI and calcium imaging, have provided unprecedented insights into the workings of the brain.

- Contemporary entomological research has highlighted studies on insect communication and social behavior, particularly in social insects like ants and bees. Research has demonstrated the complexity of pheromone communication and its role in colony dynamics. However, the neural basis of these behaviors is still not fully understood, indicating a significant gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The lack of interdisciplinary research connecting neural mechanisms with insect behavior presents a unique opportunity for exploration.
