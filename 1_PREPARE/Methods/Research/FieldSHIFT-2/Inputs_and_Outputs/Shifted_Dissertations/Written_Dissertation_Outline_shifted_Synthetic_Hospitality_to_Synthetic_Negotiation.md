# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain of Guest Experience and Negotiation represents a groundbreaking intersection of hospitality and negotiation studies. Traditional negotiation frameworks often focus on transactional outcomes, emphasizing the achievement of favorable terms and conditions. In contrast, the guest experience prioritizes relational and experiential dimensions, where the quality of interaction and the emotional resonance of the experience are paramount. This dissertation seeks to bridge these paradigms, proposing that negotiation can be enhanced by adopting principles from the guest experience. 

The hospitality industry has long recognized the importance of customer satisfaction and loyalty, with frameworks such as the SERVQUAL model emphasizing service quality dimensions. By integrating these principles into negotiation, this research posits that negotiators can foster more productive and satisfying outcomes, leading to enhanced relationships and sustained collaboration.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges conventional negotiation strategies by introducing a hospitality-based perspective. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of guest experience principles into negotiation, creating new theoretical constructs and practical applications that have the potential to revolutionize both fields. By emphasizing personalization, service quality, and relational dynamics, this dissertation aims to provide a fresh lens through which to view negotiation processes, ultimately contributing to more effective and satisfying outcomes for all parties involved.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. **How can personalization in negotiation strategies impact outcomes and satisfaction?**
2. **What role does the quality of interaction play in fostering long-term relationships in negotiation?**
3. **How can technology and environmental factors enhance negotiation experiences?**

These questions guide the exploration of the Shifted Domain, aiming to uncover the intricate connections between guest experience principles and negotiation practices. The objectives include developing an integrated theoretical framework, conducting empirical studies to test hypotheses, and providing practical recommendations for negotiators across various sectors.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

A review of the historical development of guest experience in hospitality and negotiation reveals distinct trajectories. The hospitality industry has evolved from a focus on basic service delivery to a more nuanced understanding of customer experience, emphasizing emotional engagement and satisfaction. In contrast, negotiation studies have primarily concentrated on strategies for achieving favorable outcomes, often neglecting the relational and experiential components that can significantly influence negotiation dynamics.

The origins of negotiation theory can be traced back to early economic models, which viewed negotiation as a rational, transactional process. However, contemporary scholarship has begun to acknowledge the importance of psychological and social factors in negotiation. This evolution mirrors the hospitality industry's shift toward a more customer-centric approach, highlighting the potential for cross-pollination between the two fields.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research highlights the importance of effective communication in negotiation and the critical role of service quality in hospitality. In negotiation studies, scholars have identified key factors such as trust, rapport, and emotional intelligence as essential components of successful interactions. Similarly, hospitality research emphasizes the significance of service quality dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—as determinants of customer satisfaction.

However, there is limited exploration of how these domains can inform one another. While some studies have examined the role of emotional intelligence in negotiation, few have explicitly integrated hospitality principles into negotiation frameworks. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research that can enhance both fields.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature indicates a gap in integrating hospitality principles into negotiation strategies. This research aims to fill this gap by identifying isomorphisms between the two domains and proposing a novel framework for negotiation. By examining how personalization, service quality, and relational dynamics can enhance negotiation outcomes, this dissertation seeks to contribute to a more holistic understanding of negotiation processes.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Service Quality Theory 

Service Quality Theory emphasizes the importance of meeting customer expectations and delivering high-quality service. This theory posits that service quality is a critical determinant of customer satisfaction and loyalty. In the context of negotiation, service quality can be understood as the quality of interaction and communication between negotiating parties, where meeting the needs and expectations of all parties involved can lead to more favorable outcomes.

### Negotiation Theory 

Negotiation Theory focuses on strategies for achieving favorable outcomes in negotiations. Traditional models often emphasize competitive tactics and distributive bargaining, where the primary goal is to maximize individual gains. However, contemporary approaches recognize the value of integrative negotiation, which seeks to create win-win solutions by addressing the interests and needs of all parties. This perspective aligns with the principles of guest experience, where relational dynamics and mutual satisfaction are prioritized.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Negotiation Experience Model 

The Negotiation Experience Model proposes that negotiation can be viewed as an experiential process similar to guest experiences in hospitality. This model emphasizes the importance of personalization, service quality, and emotional engagement in shaping negotiation outcomes. By framing negotiation as an experience, this model encourages negotiators to consider the relational and experiential dimensions of their interactions, ultimately leading to more satisfying and productive outcomes.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model 

The integration of service quality, personalization, and environmental factors into a cohesive model enhances negotiation processes and outcomes. This model posits that by adopting hospitality principles, negotiators can create more positive experiences that foster trust, collaboration, and long-term relationships. The proposed framework serves as a foundation for empirical studies and practical applications, offering a roadmap for integrating guest experience principles into negotiation practices.
