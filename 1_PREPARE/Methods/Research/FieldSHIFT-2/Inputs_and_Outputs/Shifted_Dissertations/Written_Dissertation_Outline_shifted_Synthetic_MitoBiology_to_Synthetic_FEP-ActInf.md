# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection of mitochondrial biology and the Free Energy Principle. Mitochondria are vital organelles responsible for energy production and metabolic regulation, while the FEP provides a theoretical framework for understanding how adaptive systems maintain equilibrium in the face of environmental variability. By integrating these two fields, we can gain insights into how biological systems optimize energy usage and cognitive processing. The ability of mitochondria to adapt to fluctuating energy demands mirrors cognitive processes that rely on predictive coding, where the brain anticipates and responds to sensory inputs to optimize behavior.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between biology and cognitive science. By framing mitochondrial processes within the context of the FEP, we can explore new models of understanding that reflect the complexity of living systems. The novelty lies in the proposed isomorphisms and the development of an integrated theoretical model that can be applied to both biological and cognitive domains. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances our understanding of mitochondrial function but also offers insights into cognitive flexibility and adaptive behavior, thereby contributing to both fields in meaningful ways.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Mitochondrial Biology

The discovery of mitochondria dates back to the mid-19th century, with the identification of these organelles as critical components of cellular respiration. Initially viewed as mere powerhouses of the cell, research has evolved to reveal their intricate roles in apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and cellular signaling. The chemiosmotic theory, proposed by Peter Mitchell in the 1960s, revolutionized our understanding of ATP synthesis and established the foundation for modern mitochondrial biology. Recent advances have highlighted the dynamic nature of mitochondria, including their biogenesis, fusion, fission, and degradation processes, which play crucial roles in cellular health and disease.

### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy by predicting sensory inputs and updating beliefs based on discrepancies between predictions and actual outcomes. This principle has gained traction in neuroscience, providing a unifying framework for understanding perception, action, and learning. The application of FEP extends to systems biology, where it offers insights into the behavior of complex adaptive systems. Key contributions from various fields have shaped the current understanding of FEP, yet challenges remain in its integration across disciplines.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Mitochondrial Biology

Recent advances in mitochondrial research have emphasized their role in aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a range of health issues, including diabetes, obesity, and cognitive decline. Current research focuses on mitochondrial dynamics, the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, and the potential for mitochondrial-targeted therapies to ameliorate disease symptoms.

### Free Energy Principle

The application of the FEP in cognitive neuroscience has provided a framework for understanding how the brain processes information and adapts to its environment. Recent debates have centered around the challenges of empirical validation and the applicability of FEP to biological systems beyond the brain. The integration of FEP with machine learning and artificial intelligence has opened new avenues for exploring adaptive systems, yet further research is needed to solidify its theoretical foundations.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the significant advancements in both mitochondrial biology and the FEP, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges these domains. The intersection of mitochondrial function and cognitive processing presents an opportunity to explore the implications of metabolic health on cognitive flexibility and adaptive behavior. By identifying gaps in the literature, this research aims to pave the way for innovative studies that can enhance our understanding of both fields.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories from mitochondrial biology, including the chemiosmotic theory and mitochondrial dynamics, provide a basis for understanding energy production and regulation within cells. The chemiosmotic theory elucidates the mechanisms of ATP synthesis, highlighting the importance of proton gradients across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondrial dynamics, encompassing processes such as fusion and fission, are critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and responding to cellular stress.

Fundamental principles of the Free Energy Principle, including predictive coding and active inference, offer insights into how cognitive systems manage uncertainty and adapt to environmental changes. Predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on error signals, while active inference emphasizes the role of action in minimizing prediction error.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs such as "Energetic Predictive Models" and "Metabolic Inference," which seek to integrate mitochondrial biology with the FEP. Energetic Predictive Models conceptualize mitochondrial function as a predictive system that optimizes energy production in response to metabolic demands. Metabolic Inference extends the principles of active inference to metabolic processes, suggesting that cells engage in predictive coding to manage energy resources effectively.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model presented in this dissertation illustrates the relationship between mitochondrial function and cognitive processing. By framing mitochondrial dynamics as a form of predictive coding, the model posits that cells utilize similar mechanisms as the brain to optimize energy usage and respond to environmental changes. This model can be empirically tested through experimental designs that assess the impact of mitochondrial function on cognitive performance and adaptive behavior.

## Mitochondrial Function as a Model for Predictive Processing

### Sub-section 1: Overview of ATP Production Mechanisms

ATP production is a critical process that underpins cellular function and energy metabolism. The primary mechanism of ATP synthesis occurs through oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves the electron transport chain, where electrons derived from metabolic substrates are transferred through a series of protein complexes, leading to the pumping of protons into the intermembrane space.
