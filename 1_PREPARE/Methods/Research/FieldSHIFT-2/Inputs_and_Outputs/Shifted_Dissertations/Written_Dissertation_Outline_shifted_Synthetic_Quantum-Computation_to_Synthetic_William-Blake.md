## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of quantum computation and the artistic philosophy of William Blake represents a groundbreaking approach that transcends traditional boundaries. Quantum computation, characterized by principles such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, provides a unique lens through which to analyze and interpret Blake's work, which is rich in dualities and interconnected themes. Quantum mechanics, with its counterintuitive properties, challenges conventional notions of reality and causality, while Blake's art and poetry similarly defy straightforward interpretations, inviting multiple readings and reflections on the nature of existence.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to revolutionize both fields. It offers a novel perspective on Blake's art, suggesting that his exploration of dualities can be understood through quantum principles. Additionally, it opens up new avenues for artistic expression that leverage the complexities of quantum computation, thus bridging the gap between science and the humanities. By situating Blake's work within the framework of quantum theory, this dissertation aims to provide fresh insights into his artistic intentions and to propose innovative methodologies for contemporary artists.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of quantum computation inform our understanding of dualities in Blake's work?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged from the foundational principles of quantum mechanics developed in the early 20th century. Pioneers such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Albert Einstein laid the groundwork for understanding the behavior of particles at the quantum level. The transition from theoretical physics to practical computation began with the work of Richard Feynman and David Deutsch, who proposed that quantum systems could be harnessed for processing information in ways that classical computers could not. Key principles include:

- **Superposition:** The ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously.
- **Entanglement:** A phenomenon where particles become interconnected, such that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance.
- **Quantum Gates:** The fundamental building blocks of quantum circuits, analogous to classical logic gates, which manipulate quantum states to perform computations.

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827), an English poet, painter, and printmaker, is renowned for his visionary art and profound philosophical insights. Living during a time of social upheaval, Blake's work reflects his critiques of industrialization, organized religion, and societal norms. His artistic philosophy is characterized by:

- **Duality:** The coexistence of opposing forces, such as innocence and experience, good and evil, and the material and spiritual realms.
- **Symbolism:** The use of rich imagery and allegory to convey complex ideas and emotions.
- **Visionary Experiences:** Blake's spiritual visions, which informed his artistic and poetic output, often serve as a critique of contemporary society.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Quantum Computation

The current state of quantum computation is marked by rapid advancements in technology and theory. Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems in cryptography, optimization, and simulation that are infeasible for classical computers. Notable developments include:

- **Quantum Algorithms:** Such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases.
- **Quantum Supremacy:** The demonstration that quantum computers can perform tasks beyond the capabilities of classical computers, as showcased by Google's Sycamore processor in 2019.

#### Blake Studies

Recent interpretations of Blake's work have focused on themes of duality and interconnectedness, often drawing from historical and cultural contexts. Scholars have explored:

- **Psychoanalytic Approaches:** Analyzing Blake's characters and themes through the lens of psychological theories.
- **Ecocriticism:** Examining Blake's relationship with nature and the environment in the context of his critiques of industrialization.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich scholarship in both quantum computation and Blake studies, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary frameworks that unite these fields. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring how quantum theory can inform literary analysis and artistic expression. The opportunities presented include:

- Innovative research methodologies that blend scientific principles with creative practices.
- New interpretations of Blake's work that resonate with contemporary scientific advancements.
