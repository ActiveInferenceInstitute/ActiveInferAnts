## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience as a key driver of satisfaction and loyalty. With the advent of technology, the expectations of guests have evolved, leading to the emergence of increasingly sophisticated service models that emphasize personalization, seamless interactions, and emotional engagement. Conversely, the ATM user experience has traditionally focused on efficiency and usability, often neglecting the holistic interaction that users have with these machines. ATMs, while designed to facilitate quick transactions, often leave users feeling disconnected and undervalued. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by applying hospitality principles to enhance the ATM user experience.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience has undergone significant transformation over the decades, evolving from mere service delivery to a comprehensive approach that encompasses emotional engagement, personalization, and holistic service design. Early hospitality models focused primarily on tangible aspects of service, such as food quality and room cleanliness. However, as competition increased, the industry began to recognize the importance of creating memorable experiences that resonate with guests on an emotional level. This shift has been characterized by the implementation of customer journey mapping, service design thinking, and a focus on creating value through personalized interactions.

#### Historical Development of ATM Technology and User Experience

The first ATMs were introduced in the late 1960s, primarily designed to streamline cash withdrawal processes. Over time, advancements in technology have expanded the functionalities of ATMs, allowing for deposits, fund transfers, and bill payments. However, the user experience has often been an afterthought, with many machines characterized by outdated interfaces, limited personalization, and a lack of engagement. Recent studies indicate that while usability remains a critical factor, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more user-centric approach that considers emotional and experiential dimensions of ATM interactions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Research in Guest Experience and Its Core Principles

Current literature on guest experience emphasizes several core principles, including personalization, service quality, emotional engagement, and the importance of user feedback. Scholars such as Lemon and Verhoef (2016) have highlighted the significance of customer experience management as a strategic approach to enhance satisfaction and loyalty. The integration of technology in hospitality has also been a focal point, with research indicating that digital touchpoints can significantly influence guest perceptions and experiences.

#### Examination of Current ATM User Experience Studies and Practices

Recent studies in ATM user experience have focused on usability, accessibility, and transaction efficiency. However, there remains a notable gap in the exploration of emotional engagement and personalization. While some financial institutions have begun to implement user-centric design principles, many ATMs still operate under traditional paradigms that prioritize functionality over user experience. This presents a unique opportunity to apply insights from the hospitality sector to redefine ATM interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting hospitality and banking, particularly in the context of user experience design. By exploring the potential benefits of applying hospitality principles to ATM user experience, this research aims to fill this gap. The integration of personalization, service quality, and emotional engagement into ATM interactions represents a promising avenue for enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty, ultimately benefiting financial institutions and their customers.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory (Parasuraman et al.)

Service Quality Theory, as proposed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), identifies dimensions of service quality that are critical to customer satisfaction. These dimensions include tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. By applying this framework to the ATM user experience, it becomes possible to assess how these dimensions influence user perceptions and satisfaction.

#### Customer Experience Management (Lemon & Verhoef)

Lemon and Verhoef (2016) introduced a comprehensive framework for understanding customer experience management, emphasizing the importance of touchpoints, customer journey, and emotional engagement. This framework provides a valuable lens through which to analyze ATM interactions and identify opportunities for enhancement.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Personalized User Experience Model for ATMs

This model proposes that ATMs can be designed to deliver personalized experiences based on user preferences and behaviors. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning algorithms, financial institutions can create adaptive interfaces that respond to individual user needs, ultimately enhancing satisfaction and engagement.

#### Feedback-Driven Improvement Loop in Banking Services

This construct emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement in service delivery based on user feedback. By establishing mechanisms for collecting and analyzing user input, financial institutions can implement iterative changes to enhance the ATM user experience, fostering a culture of responsiveness and user-centricity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a comprehensive model that integrates hospitality principles into ATM user experience. The model highlights key interactions, personalization, and feedback mechanisms, illustrating how these elements can work together to create a more engaging and satisfying user experience. By aligning the ATM user experience with established guest experience frameworks, financial institutions can leverage best practices from hospitality to enhance their service offerings.
