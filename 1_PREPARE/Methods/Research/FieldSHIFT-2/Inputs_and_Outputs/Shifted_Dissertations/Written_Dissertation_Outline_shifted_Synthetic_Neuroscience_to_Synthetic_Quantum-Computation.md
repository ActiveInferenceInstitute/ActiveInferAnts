## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Key Developments in Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved significantly since the early 20th century, beginning with the establishment of neuron doctrine by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who proposed that neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system. The development of neural network theory in the mid-20th century, particularly through the work of McCulloch and Pitts, laid the groundwork for understanding how neurons process information. The introduction of concepts such as Hebbian learning, which posits that "cells that fire together wire together," further advanced the understanding of synaptic mechanisms and their role in learning and memory.

#### Historical Evolution of Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the limitations of classical computation in addressing certain complex problems. Pioneering work by Richard Feynman and David Deutsch introduced the concept of a quantum computer capable of simulating quantum systems. The development of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information, and quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization, marked significant milestones in the field. The evolution of quantum error correction techniques has also been crucial in making practical quantum computation feasible.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Contemporary Neuroscience Literature

Current neuroscience research focuses on understanding neural networks, plasticity, and oscillations, with advancements in neuroimaging techniques allowing for real-time observation of brain activity. Key studies emphasize the role of neural oscillations in cognitive processes and the importance of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory. Additionally, the exploration of artificial neural networks in machine learning has drawn inspiration from biological neural networks, highlighting the relevance of neuroscience in computational models.
