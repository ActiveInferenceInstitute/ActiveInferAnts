## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges the operational aspects of ATM transactions with the theoretical constructs of the Free Energy Principle. FEP posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept rooted in thermodynamics and information theory. By applying FEP to ATM operations, we can understand how these machines can adapt to user behavior and environmental changes, thereby optimizing their functionality and security. This intersection of financial technology and cognitive science provides a unique perspective on user interaction and machine learning algorithms that can enhance ATM performance.

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between financial technology and cognitive science. By applying FEP to ATM transactions, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm that enhances user interaction, security measures, and operational efficiency. This research not only contributes to the academic discourse but also holds practical implications for the banking industry, potentially leading to more intuitive and secure ATM systems.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### ATM Transactions

Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have undergone significant evolution since their inception in the late 1960s. Initially designed for basic cash withdrawal, ATMs have expanded their functionalities to include deposits, transfers, and various banking services. The widespread adoption of ATMs has transformed banking by providing customers with 24/7 access to financial services, thereby enhancing convenience and operational efficiency for banks.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, introduced by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems operate to minimize their free energy, thus maintaining homeostasis. This principle has broad implications for understanding adaptive systems, including the brain's predictive coding mechanisms. FEP has been applied in various fields, from neuroscience to robotics, offering insights into how systems can adapt to their environments efficiently.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing research on user experience in financial technology highlights the importance of intuitive design and responsive interfaces. Studies have shown that user satisfaction is significantly influenced by the ease of use and the perceived security of financial transactions. In the realm of adaptive systems, FEP has been explored in contexts such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, emphasizing the potential for systems to learn from their environments and improve over time.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a gap in understanding user interactions with ATMs, particularly in the context of adaptive systems. There is an opportunity to apply FEP to enhance ATM security and operational efficiency, creating a more responsive and user-centric banking experience. This dissertation seeks to address these gaps by proposing a framework that integrates ATM transaction principles with FEP.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Self-Service Operations

Self-service operations in ATMs involve transaction flow, user interface design, and security measures. Understanding these components is crucial for enhancing the user experience and ensuring the security of transactions. Theories related to usability and user-centered design will be explored to inform the development of predictive interfaces.

#### Adaptive Systems

FEP's relevance to adaptive systems lies in its emphasis on active inference and generative models. These concepts will be applied to ATM networks to understand how they can dynamically adjust to user behavior and environmental changes, thereby minimizing variational free energy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of FEP with ATM transactions allows for the conceptualization of ATMs as adaptive systems that minimize variational free energy. This perspective encourages the development of predictive ATM interfaces that can anticipate user needs and dynamic security measures that respond to perceived threats.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a model that combines ATM transaction principles with FEP, illustrating the interplay between user experience, security, and operational efficiency. The model will serve as a foundation for empirical research and practical applications, guiding the development of adaptive ATM systems.
