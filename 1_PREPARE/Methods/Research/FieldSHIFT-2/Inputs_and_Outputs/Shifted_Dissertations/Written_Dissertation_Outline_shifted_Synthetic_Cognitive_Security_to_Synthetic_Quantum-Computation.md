## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has evolved significantly since its inception, drawing upon key theories from psychology, information science, and security studies. The foundational work of cognitive psychologists, such as Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, established the groundwork for understanding cognitive biases—systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Their research highlighted how these biases could lead to misinformation and manipulation, which are critical concerns in the information age.

In the realm of information science, the concept of cognitive security has expanded to encompass the protection of cognitive processes from external threats, including disinformation campaigns and malicious content. The rise of social media and digital communication has further underscored the importance of cognitive security, as misinformation can spread rapidly, influencing public perception and decision-making.

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged as a revolutionary field in the late 20th century, with foundational theories rooted in quantum mechanics. Key milestones include Peter Shor's algorithm for integer factorization and Lov Grover's search algorithm, which demonstrated the potential of quantum systems to outperform classical computation. The development of quantum algorithms has led to significant advancements in fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.

As quantum technologies progress, understanding their implications for security and information integrity becomes increasingly vital. The unique properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, present both opportunities and challenges in the context of cognitive security.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The latest advancements in cognitive security include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and mitigate cognitive biases in decision-making processes. Interdisciplinary collaborations between cognitive scientists, psychologists, and information technologists have yielded valuable insights into how cognitive factors can influence human behavior in digital environments.

In the realm of quantum computing, significant progress has been made in developing quantum hardware and algorithms. Technologies such as quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum machine learning are at the forefront of research, showcasing the potential applications of quantum systems across various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both cognitive security and quantum computation, there remains a notable gap in research exploring the intersection of these fields. Few studies have examined how cognitive biases can affect decision-making in quantum algorithm development or how cognitive security principles can be integrated into quantum technologies.

This research aims to address these gaps by investigating the cognitive factors that influence quantum decision-making and proposing frameworks for enhancing the integrity of quantum information. By doing so, this dissertation seeks to unlock new opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory posits that human cognitive capacity is limited, and the amount of information that can be processed simultaneously affects learning and decision-making. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of quantum computing, where the complexity of quantum algorithms and information can overwhelm users. Understanding cognitive load can inform the design of user interfaces and decision-making processes in quantum systems, ensuring that cognitive limitations are accounted for.

#### Quantum Mechanics Principles

The principles of quantum mechanics, including superposition and entanglement, serve as the foundation for quantum computation. Superposition allows quantum bits (qubits) to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement enables qubits to be interconnected in ways that classical bits cannot. These principles not only define the operational capabilities of quantum systems but also present unique challenges in terms of cognitive security, as users must navigate complex probabilistic outcomes.
