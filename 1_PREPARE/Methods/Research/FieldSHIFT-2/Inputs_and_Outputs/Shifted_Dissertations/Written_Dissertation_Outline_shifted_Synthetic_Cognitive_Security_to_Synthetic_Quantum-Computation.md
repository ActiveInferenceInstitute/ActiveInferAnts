## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has evolved significantly over recent decades, drawing from various disciplines, including psychology, information science, and communication theory. Early theories focused on the psychological effects of misinformation and propaganda, with scholars like Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays laying the groundwork for understanding how media can shape public perception. Key contributions from cognitive psychology, such as Kahneman and Tversky's work on cognitive biases, have further enriched the field, highlighting the systematic errors in judgment that can arise from cognitive shortcuts.

Recent advancements in cognitive security have expanded the scope to include the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on cognitive processes. As AI systems increasingly mediate information access, understanding their influence on human cognition becomes crucial. This evolution underscores the importance of integrating cognitive security principles into the design and implementation of emerging technologies.

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, driven by the realization that quantum mechanics could be harnessed for information processing. Foundational theories, such as the principles of superposition and entanglement, were developed by pioneers like Richard Feynman and David Deutsch. The advent of quantum algorithms, notably Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers and Grover's algorithm for database search, showcased the potential of quantum computing to outperform classical methods.

The field has since witnessed rapid advancements, with the development of quantum hardware, quantum error correction techniques, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. However, despite the technical progress, there remains a significant gap in understanding the human factors that influence quantum computing, particularly in terms of cognitive biases and decision-making processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current state of knowledge in cognitive security highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, with researchers exploring the intersections of psychology, social science, and technology. Recent studies have examined the role of cognitive biases in cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for human-centric designs that account for cognitive limitations in information processing.

In the realm of quantum computing, advancements in quantum technologies have led to practical applications across various sectors, including cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery. However, the focus has primarily been on technical improvements, with limited attention given to the cognitive aspects of quantum algorithm development and user interaction.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both cognitive security and quantum computation, there remains a notable gap in research at their intersection. Few studies have explored how cognitive factors influence quantum decision-making, and there is a lack of frameworks that integrate cognitive security principles into quantum technologies. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by investigating the cognitive biases that can affect quantum algorithm design and public understanding of quantum computing.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, posits that human cognitive capacity is limited, and instructional design should account for this limitation to enhance learning and problem-solving. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of quantum computing, where the complexity of quantum concepts can overwhelm users. Understanding cognitive load can inform the design of quantum algorithms and interfaces that are more user-friendly and accessible.

#### Quantum Mechanics Principles (Superposition and Entanglement)

Superposition and entanglement are foundational principles of quantum mechanics that enable quantum computers to perform complex calculations. Superposition allows quantum bits (qubits) to exist in multiple states simultaneously, while entanglement creates correlations between qubits that transcend classical limitations. These principles not only underpin quantum computation but also introduce unique challenges related to cognitive understanding and decision-making.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Human-Centric Quantum Algorithm Design

Human-Centric Quantum Algorithm Design focuses on creating quantum algorithms that account for cognitive limitations and biases. This approach advocates for the inclusion of cognitive insights during the algorithm development process, ensuring that quantum technologies are designed with the end-user in mind. By prioritizing human cognition, this model seeks to improve the usability and effectiveness of quantum computing applications.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model visually represents the interplay between cognitive processes and quantum computation.
