## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Biology

The evolution of biology from natural history to molecular biology is marked by key figures and milestones that have shaped our understanding of life. Early naturalists such as Aristotle and Linnaeus laid the groundwork for systematic classification, while the advent of Darwin's theory of evolution introduced dynamic principles of change and adaptation. The 20th century saw the rise of molecular biology, with breakthroughs in genetics and biotechnology revolutionizing our understanding of life at the cellular level. This historical trajectory underscores the complexity of biological systems and the need for integrative approaches that encompass both micro and macro ecological perspectives.

#### Traditional Knowledge

Traditional knowledge encompasses the accumulated wisdom of indigenous peoples, reflecting their deep connection to the land and ecosystems. Its historical development is intertwined with cultural narratives, spiritual beliefs, and practical experiences in resource management. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) has been recognized for its holistic understanding of ecosystems, emphasizing interdependence and sustainability. However, the marginalization of these practices in favor of Western scientific paradigms has led to significant losses in biodiversity and cultural heritage. By examining the historical context of traditional knowledge, this dissertation aims to highlight its relevance in contemporary environmental challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research trends in biology are increasingly focused on conservation biology, synthetic biology, and ecosystem services. The challenges faced by traditional knowledge systems, including climate change, land dispossession, and cultural erosion, necessitate a re-evaluation of their role in biodiversity conservation. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of integrating TEK with scientific approaches, yet significant gaps remain in understanding how these domains can effectively collaborate. This dissertation seeks to address these gaps by proposing a framework for interdisciplinary research that leverages the strengths of both biological and traditional knowledge systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate both biological insights and traditional practices presents a significant opportunity for innovation in environmental management. By identifying synergies between these domains, this research aims to develop collaborative frameworks that enhance ecosystem resilience and community well-being. The Shifted Domain offers a unique vantage point for exploring the complexities of ecological systems, fostering dialogue between scientists and indigenous knowledge holders to co-create sustainable solutions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Biological Theories

Key biological theories such as ecosystem dynamics, resilience theory, and biodiversity conservation frameworks provide the foundation for understanding ecological interactions. Ecosystem dynamics emphasize the interconnectedness of species and their environments, highlighting the importance of maintaining ecological balance. Resilience theory focuses on the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances and retain essential functions, while biodiversity conservation frameworks underscore the need for preserving genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. These theories offer valuable insights that can inform traditional practices and enhance sustainability.

#### Traditional Knowledge Theories

Traditional knowledge theories emphasize holistic understandings of ecosystems, cultural ecology, and sustainable resource management. Holistic approaches recognize the interconnectedness of social, cultural, and ecological systems, advocating for practices that respect the integrity of natural resources. Cultural ecology explores the relationships between human societies and their environments, highlighting the adaptive strategies employed by indigenous communities. Sustainable resource management practices rooted in traditional knowledge emphasize long-term stewardship and community engagement, offering valuable lessons for contemporary conservation efforts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of biological principles and traditional knowledge has led to the emergence of new theoretical constructs such as eco-cultural resilience and biocultural diversity. Eco-cultural resilience refers to the capacity of social-ecological systems to adapt and thrive in the face of environmental change, drawing on both scientific knowledge and traditional practices. Biocultural diversity encompasses the interrelationship between biological diversity and cultural diversity, emphasizing the importance of preserving both to ensure ecosystem health and human well-being. These constructs provide a framework for understanding the dynamic interplay between biology and traditional knowledge, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that incorporates biological principles and traditional knowledge for sustainable practices. The model emphasizes the co-production of knowledge, recognizing the value of both scientific inquiry and indigenous wisdom in addressing environmental challenges. By fostering collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and indigenous communities, this model aims to enhance ecosystem management, biodiversity conservation, and community resilience.
