## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated by neuroscientists such as Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through adaptive behaviors. This principle suggests that organisms continuously generate predictions about their environment and update these predictions based on sensory input. In contrast, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) focuses on altering dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health outcomes. The proposed integration of FEP into CBT seeks to create a new paradigm for understanding and treating mental health disorders, emphasizing the role of prediction and error correction in therapeutic settings.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of FEP into CBT offers a groundbreaking perspective on cognitive and emotional processes. This research is significant as it not only bridges cognitive neuroscience and psychotherapy but also creates a framework for predicting and addressing mental health issues through a scientific lens. The novelty lies in the application of predictive coding and variational free energy principles to therapeutic practices, providing a fresh approach to cognitive restructuring. By grounding therapeutic interventions in the principles of FEP, this research aims to enhance the efficacy of CBT and offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying psychological distress.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle inform and enhance therapeutic techniques in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?
2. What empirical evidence supports the efficacy of a predictive coding model in addressing cognitive distortions?
3. How can the concept of variational free energy be applied to understand and treat mental health disorders?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and theoretical biology. It emerged from the need to explain how biological systems maintain their integrity in the face of environmental uncertainties. Key figures such as Karl Friston have articulated the principle, emphasizing its implications for understanding brain function, perception, and action. Conversely, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has evolved since the 1960s, rooted in cognitive theories of emotion and behavior. Pioneers like Aaron Beck developed CBT as a structured, goal-oriented therapy aimed at addressing cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current understanding of the Free Energy Principle highlights its relevance to various cognitive processes, including perception, decision-making, and learning. Research indicates that organisms engage in predictive coding to minimize prediction error, a concept that has profound implications for understanding psychological phenomena. Similarly, CBT techniques, such as cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, have garnered substantial empirical support for their effectiveness in treating various mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that links cognitive neuroscience with psychotherapy. The integration of FEP concepts into CBT presents an opportunity to develop new therapeutic models that address cognitive distortions through the lens of predictive coding. This research aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel framework that combines insights from both domains, ultimately enhancing therapeutic practices and outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key theories, including predictive coding and variational inference. Predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on incoming information. Variational inference, on the other hand, provides a mathematical framework for approximating complex probability distributions, facilitating the brain's ability to minimize free energy.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is grounded in foundational theories such as cognitive restructuring, which aims to identify and modify maladaptive thought patterns, and behavioral activation, which focuses on increasing engagement in positive activities to alleviate depressive symptoms.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces new theoretical constructs, such as "Cognitive Free Energy" and "Predictive Therapy." Cognitive Free Energy refers to the mental effort involved in maintaining accurate predictions and minimizing prediction errors. Predictive Therapy emphasizes the role of prediction and error correction in therapeutic interventions, suggesting that addressing cognitive distortions can enhance emotional regulation and psychological well-being.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes FEP and CBT principles, emphasizing the role of prediction and error correction in therapy. This model posits that cognitive distortions can be understood as prediction errors, and therapeutic interventions should focus on helping clients identify and rectify these errors. By aligning therapeutic practices with the principles of predictive coding, therapists can enhance the efficacy of cognitive restructuring and emotional regulation techniques.

## Methodology
