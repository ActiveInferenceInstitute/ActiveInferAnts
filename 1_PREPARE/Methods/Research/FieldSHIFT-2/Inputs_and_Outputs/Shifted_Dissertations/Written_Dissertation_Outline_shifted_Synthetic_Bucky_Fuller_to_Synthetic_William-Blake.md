## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between the realms of design science, as articulated by Buckminster Fuller, and the artistic and literary contributions of William Blake. Fuller’s holistic and systems-oriented approach to problem-solving contrasts with Blake’s focus on the dualities of human experience, spirituality, and social critique. This dissertation will systematically explore the underlying isomorphisms between these two domains, proposing a new framework for understanding their interconnectedness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it merges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on both Fuller’s and Blake’s contributions. By highlighting the synergies between design science and artistic expression, this dissertation will create a novel discourse that challenges traditional interpretations and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings have the potential to influence educational practices, technological innovations, and societal approaches to sustainability and creativity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Buckminster Fuller’s concepts enhance our understanding of William Blake’s artistic contributions?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of these two domains?
- How can the principles of design science be applied to analyze and reinterpret Blake’s work?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Buckminster Fuller
Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and futurist. He is best known for his work on geodesic domes and his philosophy of "doing more with less." Fuller's concepts of design science emphasize the importance of holistic thinking, sustainability, and the interconnectedness of human systems. His seminal works, including "Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth" and "Synergetics," advocate for a comprehensive approach to problem-solving that transcends disciplinary boundaries.

#### William Blake
William Blake (1757-1827) was an English poet, painter, and printmaker, whose work is often associated with the Romantic movement. His major works, including "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and his illuminated manuscripts, reflect his exploration of dualities, spirituality, and social critique. Blake's artistic vision is characterized by his unique integration of text and image, revealing profound insights into the human condition and the complexities of society.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent scholarship on Fuller has focused on his contributions to sustainability and systems thinking. Scholars such as David McDonough and Michael Braungart have built upon Fuller's ideas to advocate for circular economies and sustainable design practices. Conversely, Blake's work has been interpreted through various lenses, including psychoanalytic, feminist, and post-colonial critiques, with a focus on his exploration of dualities and the human psyche.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich contributions of both Fuller and Blake, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research connecting their ideas. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by proposing innovative frameworks that integrate design science with artistic expression, thereby opening new avenues for understanding both Fuller’s and Blake’s legacies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Systems Theory and Holistic Thinking (Fuller)
Systems theory posits that systems should be viewed as wholes rather than merely the sum of their parts. Fuller's holistic approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of all elements within a system, advocating for solutions that consider the broader context of human existence and environmental sustainability.

#### Duality and Contraries (Blake)
Blake's exploration of duality is central to his artistic and literary output. He often juxtaposes opposing concepts, such as innocence and experience, heaven and hell, and reason and imagination. This dialectical approach reveals the complexities of human experience and serves as a critique of societal norms and structures.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Illuminated Synergetics
This construct examines the interplay of text and image in Blake’s work, suggesting that the integration of these elements creates emergent meanings that transcend traditional literary analysis. By applying Fuller's principles of synergetics, this framework reveals the dynamic relationships within Blake's illuminated manuscripts.

#### Tensegrity of Experience
The concept of tensegrity, which refers to the balance of structural elements in a stable configuration, can be applied to Blake’s exploration of dualities. This framework posits that human experience is characterized by a delicate balance of opposing forces, reflecting the principles of tensegrity in both art and life.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation will develop a model illustrating the synergies between Fuller's design principles and Blake’s artistic dualities. By integrating these frameworks, the model will provide a comprehensive understanding of how creativity can address complex societal challenges.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
This research adopts a qualitative approach, utilizing case studies and comparative analysis to explore the intersections between Fuller’s and Blake’s work. The emphasis will be on thematic analysis and systems thinking to uncover deeper meanings and connections.

### Data Collection Methods
#### Textual Analysis
A comprehensive textual analysis will be conducted on Blake’s illuminated manuscripts and poetry, focusing on themes of duality, spirituality, and social critique. Additionally, Fuller's writings and design principles will be examined to identify key concepts relevant to Blake's work.

### Analytical Approaches
Thematic analysis will be employed to identify and analyze key concepts and their interrelations. Systems thinking will be applied to analyze Blake’s work through Fuller's lens, allowing for a holistic understanding of the interconnectedness of ideas.

### Ethical Considerations
This research will ensure respectful interpretation of Blake’s and Fuller’s works, acknowledging the historical and cultural contexts in which they were created. Potential biases in interdisciplinary analysis will be addressed through reflexivity and critical engagement with the texts.
