## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. This principle, rooted in the biological sciences, asserts that living organisms strive to minimize the discrepancy between their predictions about the world and the actual sensory inputs they receive. In contrast, the fabric industry is characterized by a complex interplay of design, production, and consumer behavior that often leads to inefficiencies and environmental degradation. This dissertation will explore how FEP can be transposed into the fabric industry to create a more responsive and sustainable ecosystem. By framing the fabric industry as an adaptive system, we can leverage the insights from FEP to enhance decision-making processes across various stages of the fabric lifecycle.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it bridges cognitive science with textile design, offering a fresh perspective on how adaptive systems can inform and enhance traditional practices in the fabric industry. The novelty lies in the application of theoretical constructs from FEP to real-world challenges, creating an interdisciplinary framework that has the potential to revolutionize the industry. By examining the fabric industry through the lens of FEP, we can identify new pathways for innovation, particularly in the realms of sustainable practices and consumer engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in the works of Karl Friston, who articulated the mathematical foundations of this theory in the context of neuroscience and biological systems. The principle is anchored in the idea that organisms and systems operate under a drive to minimize free energy, which encapsulates uncertainty and prediction error. This section will provide a comprehensive overview of FEP, tracing its historical development and foundational theories.

The fabric industry, on the other hand, has evolved significantly over the centuries, from traditional hand-weaving practices to the industrialization of textile production. Key innovations, such as the spinning jenny and the Jacquard loom, have shaped the landscape of fabric creation. However, the industry has also faced challenges, including environmental degradation, labor exploitation, and the need for sustainable practices. This historical context will set the stage for understanding the potential synergies between FEP and the fabric industry.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research on FEP has expanded beyond neuroscience to include applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive modeling. The principles of predictive coding and active inference are increasingly being leveraged in various domains, offering insights into how systems can adapt and learn from their environments. This literature review will synthesize current findings and highlight the relevance of FEP to adaptive systems.

In parallel, the fabric industry is witnessing a surge in interest in sustainability, driven by consumer demand for eco-friendly products and the need to address climate change. Innovations in materials science, such as the development of biodegradable fabrics and recycling technologies, are reshaping production practices. This section will analyze these trends and their implications for the fabric industry, emphasizing the need for a more integrated approach to design and production.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing body of literature on FEP and its applications, there remains a significant gap in research that explicitly connects these concepts to the fabric industry. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by identifying opportunities for innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. The integration of FEP into fabric design and production practices presents a unique opportunity to enhance sustainability, optimize resource use, and improve consumer engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

This section will delve into the key concepts underpinning the Free Energy Principle, including variational free energy, predictive coding, and active inference. Variational free energy serves as a measure of surprise or prediction error, guiding adaptive behavior in response to environmental changes. Predictive coding, as a framework for understanding perception and action, posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory inputs and updates these predictions based on incoming data. Active inference extends this framework by emphasizing the role of action in minimizing prediction error.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The application of FEP to the fabric industry will yield new theoretical constructs, such as textile generative models and sustainability variational free energy. Textile generative models will explore how predictive coding can inform design processes, enabling designers to create fabrics that align with consumer preferences. Sustainability variational free energy will provide a framework for assessing the environmental impact of fabric production and guiding sustainable practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, synthesizing FEP and fabric industry practices. This model will highlight the relationships between adaptive systems, design, and sustainability, illustrating how the principles of FEP can inform a more responsive and responsible fabric ecosystem. The model will serve as a foundation for the subsequent research design and methodology.
