## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle and Its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated by Karl Friston, posits that living systems are driven to minimize free energy, which can be understood as a measure of surprise or uncertainty in the face of sensory input. This principle is deeply rooted in Bayesian inference and predictive coding, where the brain continuously generates hypotheses about incoming sensory information and updates these hypotheses based on new data. The foundational theories of FEP encompass variational free energy, active inference, and predictive coding, which together elucidate the mechanisms through which adaptive systems maintain their integrity and functionality.

#### Historical Development of the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has undergone significant transformations since its inception, from traditional hand-weaving techniques to the advent of mechanized production during the Industrial Revolution. Key innovations, such as the Jacquard loom and synthetic fibers, have reshaped the landscape of textile manufacturing. However, the industry faces numerous challenges, including environmental degradation, overproduction, and a disconnect between consumer preferences and production practices. This historical context provides a backdrop for exploring the applicability of FEP in addressing contemporary issues in the fabric industry.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Contemporary Research on FEP in Cognitive Science

Recent research in cognitive science has expanded the application of FEP beyond biological systems to encompass social and ecological dynamics. Studies have demonstrated how FEP can inform our understanding of perception, action, and decision-making processes. Furthermore, the integration of FEP with machine learning and artificial intelligence has opened new avenues for exploring adaptive systems in various domains. However, the application of these principles to the fabric industry remains largely unexplored, presenting a significant opportunity for interdisciplinary research.

#### Analysis of Current Trends in the Fabric Industry

The fabric industry is currently witnessing a shift towards sustainability, driven by consumer demand and regulatory pressures. Innovations in materials science, such as bio-based textiles and circular economy practices, are gaining traction. Additionally, advancements in technology, including automation and data analytics, are transforming production processes. Despite these developments, there is a lack of cohesive frameworks that integrate cognitive principles with industry practices, highlighting the need for further exploration of this intersection.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Detailed Examination of Key Concepts from the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key concepts that are essential for understanding its application to the fabric industry:

1. **Variational Free Energy**: This concept refers to the difference between the predicted sensory input and the actual sensory input, serving as a measure of surprise. Systems strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and adaptiveness.

2. **Predictive Coding**: This theory posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on discrepancies between expected and actual input. This process facilitates efficient information processing and adaptive behavior.

3. **Active Inference**: This principle extends predictive coding by suggesting that organisms do not passively receive information but actively engage with their environment to reduce uncertainty. This involves both updating beliefs and taking actions to fulfill predictions.
