2. What are the potential impacts of integrating cultural narratives into gameplay?
3. How can sensory elements from cuisine inform the design of immersive game experiences?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary practices has been profoundly influenced by trade, migration, and technology. Historically, the movement of people and goods across borders has led to the blending of culinary traditions, resulting in the rich tapestry of global cuisine we see today. The role of cuisine extends beyond mere sustenance; it is a vital component of cultural identity, social norms, and community bonding. Scholars such as Appadurai (1988) have emphasized the importance of food in shaping social relationships and cultural practices, making it a significant area of study within cultural anthropology.

### Game Design

The historical evolution of game design has transitioned from simple, text-based games to complex interactive experiences that encompass a multitude of genres. The advent of technology has enabled game designers to create immersive worlds that engage players in unprecedented ways. The emergence of diverse genres, such as role-playing games (RPGs), first-person shooters (FPS), and narrative-driven games, has shifted player expectations towards more intricate storytelling and interactive mechanics. The work of Juul (2005) and K. Salen and E. Zimmerman (2004) highlights the evolution of game mechanics and player engagement, underscoring the dynamic nature of the gaming industry.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Cuisine

Current trends in the culinary world emphasize sustainability, health, and culinary fusion. The growing interest in plant-based diets and local sourcing has prompted chefs and culinary experts to rethink traditional practices. Ongoing research into the sensory experiences associated with food, such as the impact of aroma and presentation on taste perception, has provided deeper insights into how culinary elements can engage the senses. Scholars like Spence (2015) have explored how multisensory experiences shape our understanding of food, which can be paralleled in game design.

### Game Design

Rapid technological advancements have transformed game mechanics and player experiences. Innovations in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new avenues for immersive gameplay. However, ethical considerations surrounding monetization and player engagement practices have also emerged, prompting discussions about player agency and the integrity of game design. Research by Zagal and Bruckman (2008) highlights the importance of ethical frameworks in game design, indicating a need for responsible practices that prioritize player experiences.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich histories and current trends in both cuisine and game design, there remains a limited exploration of cultural narratives in game design. The underutilization of sensory experiences in enhancing player immersion presents a significant opportunity for innovation. This dissertation aims to bridge these gaps by proposing a framework that integrates culinary principles into game design, thereby enriching the narrative and sensory dimensions of gameplay.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Cuisine

Cultural anthropology provides a foundational understanding of the significance of food in society. Theories related to sensory perception, particularly those concerning taste and aroma, offer insights into how culinary experiences can be translated into interactive media. The work of theorists such as Lakoff and Johnson (1980) highlights the metaphorical nature of taste, which can be leveraged to create immersive narratives in games.

### Game Design

Game mechanics and player engagement theories, as articulated by Salen and Zimmerman (2004), provide a framework for understanding how players interact with games. Narrative theory, particularly the work of Murray (1997), emphasizes the role of storytelling in interactive media, suggesting that games can serve as powerful vehicles for cultural narratives.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The concept of "Flavor Mechanics" emerges as a framework for integrating layered gameplay. This construct posits that gameplay can be enriched by incorporating culinary elements that resonate with players' sensory experiences. Additionally, the idea of "Cultural Narrative" serves as a means to enhance player connection to the game, emphasizing the importance of storytelling in fostering engagement.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines culinary principles with game design frameworks. This model focuses on cultural narratives, sensory experiences, and gameplay mechanics, aiming to create a holistic approach to game design that enhances player engagement and cultural representation.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed to explore the integration of culinary principles into game design. This methodology combines qualitative and quantitative research to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Shifted Domain.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with game designers and culinary experts, allowing for a diverse range of perspectives. Additionally, playtesting of games designed with culinary principles will provide empirical data on player engagement and experience.

## Analytical Approaches

Thematic analysis will be utilized to identify common themes within qualitative data, while statistical analysis will be employed to assess player engagement metrics from playtests. This dual approach will ensure a robust analysis of the research questions.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and measures will be taken to maintain confidentiality and address potential biases in data collection.
