## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary practices has been profoundly influenced by historical events, cultural exchanges, and technological advancements. From the introduction of new ingredients through exploration and trade to the impact of industrialization on food production, the landscape of cuisine is a tapestry woven from diverse cultural threads. The study of cuisine encompasses not only the preparation and presentation of food but also the socio-economic and political contexts that shape dietary practices. Historical texts, anthropological studies, and culinary histories provide insight into how traditional cuisines have adapted over time, reflecting shifts in societal values and technological capabilities.

#### Culinary Innovation and Sustainability

The rise of sustainable practices in culinary arts can be traced back to increasing environmental concerns and health challenges. The late 20th century saw a growing awareness of the impacts of industrial agriculture, food waste, and the carbon footprint of food systems. Movements such as organic farming, farm-to-table dining, and the slow food movement emerged as counter-narratives to mass-produced food and unsustainable practices. These movements emphasize the importance of local sourcing, seasonal ingredients, and ethical consumption, thus laying the groundwork for a new paradigm in culinary innovation that prioritizes sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary culinary trends reflect a heightened awareness of health consciousness, sustainability, and globalization. The farm-to-table movement has gained traction, emphasizing the importance of sourcing ingredients from local producers to reduce carbon footprints and support local economies. Additionally, the impact of globalization has led to the fusion of culinary traditions, resulting in innovative dishes that blend techniques and flavors from around the world. However, despite these advancements, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects traditional culinary practices with modern sustainability efforts.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in the literature presents an opportunity for innovative contributions to the field. While there is substantial research on sustainability in culinary practices, the integration of traditional techniques into modern contexts remains underexplored. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by examining how cultural heritage can inform sustainable culinary innovations, thus fostering a more holistic understanding of culinary arts in the 21st century.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cultural Theory

Cultural theory posits that cuisine is a reflection of cultural identity and social structures. It emphasizes the role of food in shaping communal identities, traditions, and social hierarchies. By examining cuisine through this lens, one can appreciate the significance of culinary practices as markers of cultural heritage and expressions of community values. This theoretical framework supports the notion that traditional culinary techniques are not merely relics of the past but living practices that can inform contemporary culinary innovation.

#### Sustainability Theory

Sustainability theory encompasses principles of environmental stewardship and sustainable practices in food systems. It advocates for practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This theory underlines the importance of ethical sourcing, waste reduction, and resource conservation in culinary practices. By integrating sustainability theory with cultural theory, this dissertation aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how culinary arts can contribute to sustainable development.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Stewardship

Culinary stewardship emphasizes the responsibility of culinary professionals to advocate for sustainable practices. This concept extends beyond individual actions to encompass collective responsibility within the culinary community. Chefs, restaurateurs, and culinary educators play a crucial role in shaping consumer attitudes and behaviors toward sustainability. By fostering a culture of stewardship, culinary professionals can lead by example and inspire others to adopt sustainable practices.

#### Flavor Sustainability

Flavor sustainability is a framework for maximizing flavor while minimizing environmental impact. It encourages the exploration of underutilized ingredients, innovative cooking techniques, and sustainable sourcing practices that enhance flavor profiles without compromising ecological integrity. This construct highlights the potential for culinary innovation to drive sustainability efforts while maintaining the sensory qualities that define exceptional cuisine.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that connects traditional culinary practices with sustainable innovations. The model illustrates the potential for cultural adaptation, community engagement, and collaborative practices to foster a more sustainable culinary landscape. By integrating insights from cultural theory and sustainability theory, this model serves as a foundation for exploring the intersections of cuisine and culinary innovation.
