# Transforming Hospitality Management through Guest Experience Principles

## Executive Summary

The proposed dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating guest experience principles from Domain A (Guest Experience) into Domain B (Guest Experience in Hospitality Management). This research will establish a comprehensive framework that redefines hospitality management practices, emphasizing a holistic approach to guest experience, personalized service through data analytics, sustainable operations, and employee engagement. By addressing the gaps in current hospitality management paradigms, this dissertation seeks to make significant contributions to both academic knowledge and practical applications in the industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Historically, the hospitality industry has prioritized operational efficiency, often at the expense of guest experience. This traditional focus has been driven by the need to maximize profitability and streamline operations, leading to a standardized service model that fails to cater to the unique needs of individual guests. However, the advent of technology and the evolution of consumer expectations have necessitated a paradigm shift. Modern guests demand personalized experiences, seamless interactions, and a greater emphasis on sustainability. This shift towards a guest-centric model is not merely a trend but a fundamental transformation that can enhance satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, business performance.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges the gap between theoretical principles of guest experience and practical applications in hospitality management. By introducing a novel framework that prioritizes guest journey management, personalization, sustainability, and employee engagement, this dissertation offers a fresh perspective on enhancing guest satisfaction and operational success. The integration of these elements is expected to not only improve the guest experience but also foster a more engaged workforce, leading to a sustainable competitive advantage for hospitality organizations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can a holistic guest experience management framework be effectively integrated into hospitality management practices?
2. What role does data-driven personalization play in enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can sustainable practices be embedded into operational strategies without compromising efficiency?
4. What is the impact of employee empowerment on guest experience and satisfaction?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Domain A: Overview of Guest Experience Principles

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the years, transitioning from a focus on service quality to a more comprehensive understanding of the guest journey. Early models of guest experience emphasized tangible aspects such as service delivery and physical environment. However, contemporary theories recognize the importance of emotional engagement, storytelling, and the creation of memorable experiences. Scholars like Pine and Gilmore (1999) introduced the Experience Economy, positing that businesses should focus on creating value through experiences rather than merely providing services.

#### Domain B: Examination of Traditional Hospitality Management Practices

Traditional hospitality management practices have primarily centered around operational efficiency, cost reduction, and standardized service delivery. The emphasis on these metrics has often led to a neglect of the guest's emotional and experiential needs. Research has shown that such a narrow focus can result in decreased guest satisfaction and loyalty, as guests increasingly seek personalized and meaningful interactions during their stay.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An extensive review of existing literature reveals a growing body of research exploring the intersection of guest experience and hospitality management. Studies have highlighted the operational challenges faced by hospitality organizations in adopting a guest-centric approach. While there is recognition of the importance of enhancing guest experience, many organizations struggle to implement effective strategies that align with their operational goals.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing interest in guest experience, significant gaps remain in the literature regarding its integration into hospitality management practices. Few studies have explored the comprehensive frameworks that can guide this integration, leaving a void that this dissertation seeks to fill. Opportunities for novel research exist in examining the synergies between guest experience principles and operational strategies, particularly in the context of data-driven personalization and sustainability.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory

Service Quality Theory posits that the quality of service is a critical determinant of customer satisfaction. This theory, often measured through the SERVQUAL model, emphasizes the gap between customer expectations and perceptions of service delivery. In the context of hospitality, this theory underscores the need for organizations to align their service offerings with guest expectations to enhance satisfaction.

#### Experience Economy Theory

Experience Economy Theory, introduced by Pine and Gilmore, emphasizes that businesses must create memorable experiences for their customers. This theory suggests that the value of a service is derived not only from its functional benefits but also from the emotional and experiential aspects it offers. For hospitality organizations, this means rethinking service delivery to focus on creating enriching experiences for guests.

#### Employee Engagement Theory

Employee Engagement Theory highlights the importance of fostering a motivated and engaged workforce to enhance service delivery. Research indicates that engaged employees are more likely to provide exceptional service, leading to improved guest satisfaction. This theory serves as a foundation for exploring the relationship between employee empowerment and guest experience in hospitality settings.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Holistic Guest Experience Management (HEM)

Holistic Guest Experience Management (HEM) encompasses an integrated approach that considers every touchpoint in the guest journey. This construct emphasizes the need for hospitality organizations to design experiences that are cohesive, personalized, and memorable, ensuring that guests feel valued throughout their stay.

#### Data-Driven Personalization (DDP)

Data-Driven Personalization (DDP) refers to the use of data analytics to tailor experiences to individual guest preferences. This construct highlights the importance of leveraging guest data to enhance satisfaction and loyalty, allowing hospitality organizations to anticipate needs and deliver personalized services.

#### Sustainable Hospitality Practices (SHP)

Sustainable Hospitality Practices (SHP) focus on integrating environmentally and socially responsible practices into hospitality operations. This construct emphasizes the importance of sustainability in enhancing guest experiences, as modern consumers increasingly prioritize eco-friendly practices and corporate social responsibility.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interrelationships between HEM, DDP, SHP, and employee engagement. This model demonstrates how these constructs collectively enhance guest experience, creating a synergistic effect that leads to improved satisfaction, loyalty, and operational success.
