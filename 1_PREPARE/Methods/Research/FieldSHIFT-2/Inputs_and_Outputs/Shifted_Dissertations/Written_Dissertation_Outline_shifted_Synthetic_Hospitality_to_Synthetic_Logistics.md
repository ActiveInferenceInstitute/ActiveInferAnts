# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain focuses on the intersection of guest experience from hospitality and operational logistics. Historically, these two fields have operated independently; however, the increasing demand for personalized services and customer-centric approaches in logistics has created an opportunity for cross-pollination of ideas and practices. The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, recognizing that personalized services and emotional engagement can significantly enhance customer satisfaction. In contrast, logistics has traditionally been characterized by a focus on operational efficiency, cost reduction, and supply chain optimization. The advent of e-commerce and the rise of customer expectations have prompted a reevaluation of logistics practices, leading to a paradigm shift where customer experience is becoming a critical competitive differentiator.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional logistics paradigms by introducing a guest experience lens, which has been successfully implemented in hospitality. The novelty lies in the systematic adaptation of service-oriented principles to logistics, thereby creating a new paradigm that prioritizes customer satisfaction and engagement. The study aims to fill a critical gap in the literature by providing a structured framework that logistics companies can adopt to enhance their service delivery through personalized experiences. Furthermore, by bridging the gap between two traditionally siloed industries, this research opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can guest experience principles be effectively transposed to enhance logistics services?
2. What frameworks can be developed to measure and optimize the logistics experience?
3. How do personalized logistics solutions impact customer satisfaction and loyalty?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience in hospitality encompasses various dimensions, including service quality, personalization, and guest engagement practices. The service quality framework, notably encapsulated in the SERVQUAL model, emphasizes the gap between customer expectations and perceptions of service delivery. Personalization, defined as tailoring services to meet individual customer needs, has become a cornerstone of successful hospitality operations. The importance of the servicescape, which refers to the physical environment where service encounters occur, cannot be overstated, as it significantly influences guest perceptions and satisfaction. Moreover, employee satisfaction plays a pivotal role in shaping guest experiences, as engaged employees are more likely to provide exceptional service.

### Logistics Operations

The evolution of logistics has been marked by a focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and supply chain management. The traditional view of logistics as a back-end function has been challenged by the emergence of customer-centric approaches. Current challenges in last-mile delivery, such as delays and lack of visibility, underscore the need for innovative solutions. Additionally, the adoption of technology in logistics, including automation and data analytics, has transformed operational capabilities but often overlooks the importance of customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Guest Experience

Recent advancements in technology-enhanced personalization and customer engagement strategies have reshaped the hospitality landscape. The integration of data analytics, artificial intelligence, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems has enabled hospitality providers to deliver tailored experiences that resonate with guests. Furthermore, the emphasis on emotional engagement and authentic interactions has become increasingly relevant, as customers seek meaningful connections with brands.

### Logistics

Innovations in supply chain visibility, transparency, and sustainability practices are redefining logistics operations. The rise of omnichannel retailing has necessitated a reevaluation of logistics strategies, with a focus on enhancing customer experience through improved communication and service delivery. However, the logistics sector still grapples with a lack of customer-centric frameworks, highlighting the need for research that integrates guest experience principles into logistics practices.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in the application of customer-centric frameworks within logistics. While the hospitality industry has effectively leveraged guest experience principles, logistics has yet to fully embrace this paradigm shift. Opportunities exist to leverage technology for enhancing customer interactions, creating a more personalized and engaging logistics experience that aligns with contemporary consumer expectations.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Service Quality Models

Service quality models, such as SERVQUAL, provide a foundational understanding of how service delivery can be measured and improved. These models highlight the importance of dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles in shaping customer perceptions of service quality.

### Supply Chain Management Theories

Supply chain management theories emphasize the interconnectivity of various stakeholders and the importance of collaboration in achieving operational efficiency. The integration of customer-centric approaches into these theories can enhance the overall service quality and customer satisfaction within logistics.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Logistics Experience Model (LX Model)

The Logistics Experience (LX) Model emerges as a new theoretical construct that integrates guest experience elements into logistics operations. This model emphasizes personalization, technology integration, and employee engagement as critical components of enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Co-Creation Framework in Logistics

The Co-Creation Framework posits that value is created through collaborative interactions between logistics providers and customers. This framework encourages the active involvement of customers in the logistics process, fostering a sense of ownership and enhancing the overall experience.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes insights from both domains, illustrating how guest experience principles can be systematically transposed to logistics operations. This model serves as a roadmap for logistics companies seeking to enhance their service delivery through a customer-centric lens.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed to explore the transposition of guest experience principles to logistics. This approach combines qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in enhancing the logistics experience.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with logistics professionals and customers. Surveys will assess perceptions of service quality and customer satisfaction, while interviews will provide in-depth insights into the experiences of both logistics providers and customers. Additionally, case studies of logistics companies implementing guest experience strategies will be conducted to illustrate best practices.

## Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis of survey data will be employed to identify trends and correlations between personalized logistics solutions and customer satisfaction. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews will uncover underlying themes and patterns related to customer experiences in logistics.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring transparency and respect for their autonomy. Confidentiality will be maintained, and data privacy concerns related to customer information will be addressed in accordance with relevant regulations.
