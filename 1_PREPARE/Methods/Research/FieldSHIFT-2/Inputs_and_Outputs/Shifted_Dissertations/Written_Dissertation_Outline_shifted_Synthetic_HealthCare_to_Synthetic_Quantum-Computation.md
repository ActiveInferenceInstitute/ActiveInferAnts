## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of healthcare principles with quantum computation. Healthcare traditionally emphasizes personalized care, service quality, and technology integration, focusing on enhancing patient experiences through tailored interventions and outcomes. Conversely, quantum computation leverages the principles of quantum mechanics—such as superposition and entanglement—to achieve advanced data processing capabilities that far exceed classical computing limits. This dissertation seeks to identify synergies between these fields, proposing a comprehensive framework that enhances both patient experiences in healthcare and user experiences in quantum systems. By drawing parallels between the two domains, we can create a holistic approach that prioritizes user engagement and satisfaction, ultimately leading to more effective and reliable quantum computing systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it introduces a new paradigm for quantum computing that prioritizes user experience, akin to patient-centered care in healthcare. The novelty lies in the application of established healthcare methodologies—such as patient journey mapping, service quality assessment, and user feedback mechanisms—to solve pressing challenges in quantum computation. By doing so, we aim to revolutionize both fields, enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum systems while simultaneously improving patient care practices through advanced computational techniques.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can healthcare principles be effectively transposed to enhance quantum computation?
2. What new metrics and frameworks can be developed to assess the quality and reliability of quantum algorithms?
3. How does user feedback influence the design and effectiveness of quantum systems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Evolution of Healthcare Principles

The evolution of healthcare principles has been marked by a gradual shift from a provider-centric model to a patient-centered approach. Early healthcare practices were predominantly focused on the clinical aspects of treatment, often neglecting the subjective experiences of patients. However, the emergence of theories such as the Service Quality Model and Patient-Centered Care frameworks has emphasized the importance of understanding patient needs, preferences, and experiences. These frameworks advocate for a holistic view of healthcare, where the patient's voice is integral to the design and delivery of services.

#### Development of Quantum Computation

Quantum computation, on the other hand, has its roots in the principles of quantum mechanics, which were first articulated in the early 20th century. The foundational principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference have paved the way for the development of quantum algorithms capable of solving complex problems that are intractable for classical computers. Despite its potential, the field of quantum computation has faced numerous challenges, including high error rates, coherence times, and the need for robust algorithmic frameworks.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Patient Experience and Service Quality in Healthcare

Current research in healthcare emphasizes the significance of patient experience as a critical determinant of service quality. Studies have demonstrated that positive patient experiences are associated with better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and improved adherence to treatment protocols. Metrics such as the Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ) and the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) have been developed to quantitatively assess patient experiences and guide quality improvement initiatives.

#### Challenges in Quantum Computation

In quantum computation, ongoing research is focused on mitigating challenges such as decoherence, error correction, and the development of efficient quantum algorithms. Despite significant advancements, the field still grapples with issues related to scalability, noise, and user engagement. These challenges underscore the need for innovative approaches that prioritize user experience, akin to the patient-centered strategies employed in healthcare.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a notable gap in the application of user-centric approaches within the realm of quantum computing. While healthcare has made significant strides in incorporating patient feedback into service design, quantum computation has largely remained a technical domain with limited consideration for user experience. This presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, where healthcare professionals and quantum computing experts can co-create solutions that enhance system usability and reliability.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Patient Experience Theories

Key theories that inform the patient experience include the Service Quality Model, which posits that service quality is determined by the gap between customer expectations and perceptions, and the Patient-Centered Care framework, which emphasizes the importance of patient engagement, shared decision-making, and holistic care.

#### Quantum Mechanics Principles

In quantum mechanics, principles such as superposition—the ability of a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously—and entanglement—the phenomenon where the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of distance—are foundational to quantum computation. These principles enable the development of algorithms that can process vast amounts of data in parallel, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes the development of new theoretical constructs such as Quantum Patient Experience (QPE) and Quantum Service Quality (QSQ). QPE encompasses the user experience in quantum systems, drawing parallels to patient experiences in healthcare, while QSQ focuses on the quality metrics specific to quantum computations, such as coherence, error rates, and user satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes healthcare principles with quantum computing methodologies, emphasizing user experience and service quality metrics. This model will serve as a foundation for developing new frameworks and metrics that can be applied to assess the performance and reliability of quantum algorithms while prioritizing user engagement.
