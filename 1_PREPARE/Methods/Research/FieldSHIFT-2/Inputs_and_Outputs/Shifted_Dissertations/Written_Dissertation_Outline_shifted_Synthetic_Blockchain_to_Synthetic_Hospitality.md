## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has traditionally relied on centralized systems for managing guest data and service delivery. Centralization often leads to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and challenges related to data privacy and security. However, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an opportunity to decentralize these processes, enhancing guest experience through greater control, transparency, and automation.

Blockchain technology is characterized by its distributed ledger system, which allows multiple parties to access and verify transactions without the need for a central authority. This decentralization empowers guests by providing them with greater control over their personal data and interactions with hospitality providers. Moreover, the transparency inherent in blockchain can foster trust between guests and service providers, addressing common concerns regarding data security and service quality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it represents a pioneering effort to apply blockchain principles to the hospitality sector. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of blockchain concepts to create new models for guest engagement that prioritize personalization and trust. By focusing on the intersection of these two domains, this dissertation aims to fill a critical gap in existing literature and practice.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they hold practical significance for hospitality businesses seeking to enhance guest experiences and operational efficiencies. The integration of blockchain technology into hospitality practices may lead to the development of innovative solutions that redefine guest interactions, loyalty programs, and service recovery processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation seeks to address the following research questions:

1. How can decentralized guest profiles enhance personalization while maintaining privacy?
2. What impact does transparency in service quality metrics have on guest trust and loyalty?
3. In what ways can smart contracts streamline service recovery processes?
4. How can tokenized loyalty programs foster greater guest engagement?

The objectives of this research include developing a framework for decentralized guest profiles, creating a Service Trust Ledger (STL) for transparency in service quality, designing smart contracts for service delivery, and establishing a tokenized loyalty program that enhances guest engagement.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Blockchain

The origins of blockchain technology can be traced back to the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 by an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The underlying technology, a decentralized ledger, enabled secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. Key milestones in the development of decentralized systems include the emergence of Ethereum in 2015, which introduced smart contracts, and the proliferation of various blockchain platforms designed for different applications, including supply chain management and finance. 

#### Guest Experience

Historically, the hospitality industry has focused on providing exceptional service to enhance guest experience. Early approaches relied heavily on personalized service, often facilitated by human interaction. However, the integration of technology has transformed service delivery, with innovations such as online booking systems, mobile check-ins, and customer relationship management (CRM) tools becoming commonplace. The evolution of technology integration in hospitality reflects a shift toward more efficient and scalable service models, yet challenges remain in achieving genuine personalization and trust.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in blockchain applications have demonstrated its potential across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. The hospitality sector has begun to explore these possibilities, yet there is a notable lack of comprehensive research that examines the specific applications of blockchain technology in enhancing guest experience. Current trends in guest experience management emphasize personalization, convenience, and transparency, but the integration of blockchain as a solution remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of blockchain technology and guest experience presents significant gaps in research. There is a lack of empirical studies that investigate how blockchain can address challenges such as data privacy, trust, and operational inefficiencies in hospitality. This dissertation aims to leverage these opportunities, proposing innovative solutions that harness blockchain's capabilities to enhance guest interactions and service delivery.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Theories of decentralization and trust are foundational to understanding blockchain technology. Decentralization refers to the distribution of authority and control across multiple entities, reducing reliance on a single central authority. Trust theories in blockchain emphasize the role of transparency and verification in establishing trust among participants in a network.

In the context of hospitality, service quality and guest satisfaction theories provide a framework for understanding the factors that contribute to positive guest experiences. These theories highlight the importance of perceived service quality, customer expectations, and the role of technology in shaping guest interactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of blockchain principles into guest experience frameworks necessitates the development of new theoretical constructs. This includes the creation of a decentralized service delivery model that prioritizes guest control, privacy, and transparency. Additionally, the concept of a Service Trust Ledger (STL) emerges as a means to enhance trust through transparent service quality metrics.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a comprehensive model illustrating the relationship between blockchain elements and guest experience outcomes. The model encompasses decentralized guest profiles, transparent service quality metrics, smart contracts for service delivery, and tokenized loyalty programs, demonstrating how these components interact to enhance personalization, trust, and operational efficiency in hospitality.
