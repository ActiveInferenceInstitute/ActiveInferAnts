# PhD Dissertation: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and mitochondrial function, proposing a novel framework that reconsiders mitochondria as adaptive systems employing predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy to optimize energy production and maintain cellular health. By examining how these theoretical constructs can be transposed to mitochondrial dynamics, this research promises to uncover new insights into mitochondrial behavior, inform therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial dysfunction, and revolutionize our understanding of cellular energetics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity and functionality. This principle has primarily been applied within the realm of cognitive neuroscience, where it elucidates how organisms adaptively respond to their environments. Mitochondria, as the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role in energy production and metabolism, functioning not merely as organelles but as dynamic entities capable of responding to cellular demands. This dissertation explores the potential of integrating these two domains, suggesting that mitochondria may operate under principles akin to those guiding cognitive processes, thereby offering a new lens through which to examine their function.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging cognitive neuroscience and cellular biology. By applying concepts from FEP to mitochondrial dynamics, this study aims to reveal underlying mechanisms of energy management that could lead to advancements in understanding metabolic disorders and developing new therapeutic approaches. The novelty of this research is rooted in the application of cognitive theories to cellular functions, potentially leading to groundbreaking insights into how mitochondria contribute to overall cellular health and adaptability.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, first articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize the discrepancy between their predictions and actual sensory inputs. This principle has profound implications for understanding adaptive behavior, suggesting that organisms are constantly engaged in a process of inference and learning, adjusting their internal models to better predict future states. The development of this principle has been pivotal in cognitive neuroscience, providing a framework for understanding how brains process information and interact with the environment.

#### Mitochondrial Function

Historically, mitochondria have been recognized primarily for their role in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. Over the past few decades, research has expanded to reveal their involvement in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This evolving understanding underscores the importance of mitochondria not only as energy producers but also as central players in cellular signaling and homeostasis.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in FEP and its applications in neuroscience have highlighted its utility in explaining a range of cognitive phenomena, from perception to action. In parallel, contemporary research on mitochondrial dynamics has illuminated the complexities of mitochondrial behavior, including the processes of fusion and fission, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and the role of mitochondria in metabolic diseases. However, a significant gap exists in the integration of these two fields, with few studies exploring how cognitive principles might inform our understanding of mitochondrial function.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary approaches combining cognitive theories with mitochondrial research presents a unique opportunity for novel research directions. By exploring how the principles of predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy can be applied to mitochondrial dynamics, this dissertation aims to fill this gap, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic strategies for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction and related metabolic disorders.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Predictive Coding

Predictive coding is a theoretical framework suggesting that the brain continuously generates and updates internal models of the world to minimize prediction error. This process involves the comparison of predicted sensory inputs with actual sensory information, allowing for adaptive behavior. The implications of predictive coding extend beyond sensory processing, encompassing learning, decision-making, and even social interactions.

#### Active Inference

Active inference posits that organisms actively engage with their environments to minimize surprise, thereby maintaining homeostasis. This concept emphasizes the role of action in shaping sensory experiences and highlights the interconnectedness of perception, action, and cognition. Active inference suggests that organisms do not merely react to environmental stimuli but actively shape their experiences through their actions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Mitochondrial Predictive Coding

This dissertation proposes the concept of mitochondrial predictive coding, which posits that mitochondria may utilize internal models to predict ATP demands based on cellular activity. By anticipating energy needs, mitochondria can optimize their metabolic pathways, enhancing efficiency and responsiveness to changing cellular conditions.

#### Energetic Active Inference

Energetic active inference provides a framework for understanding how mitochondria respond to cellular demands. This construct suggests that mitochondria engage in adaptive behaviors, such as altering their morphology and metabolic output, to minimize discrepancies between predicted and actual energy needs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This research proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes FEP with mitochondrial function. The model outlines the interactions between predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy, emphasizing how these principles can inform our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics and their role in cellular health.
