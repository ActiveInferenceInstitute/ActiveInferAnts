## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Development of Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved significantly over the past century, with key milestones including the discovery of the neuron as the fundamental unit of the nervous system by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, the identification of neurotransmitters, and advances in neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI. These developments have paved the way for understanding complex cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision-making. The integration of behavioral neuroscience with cognitive psychology has further enriched our understanding of how individuals interact with technology.

#### Evolution of ATM Technology

The evolution of ATM technology began in the late 1960s with the introduction of the first cash dispensing machines. Over the years, ATMs have transformed from simple cash dispensers to sophisticated machines capable of handling a variety of transactions, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. This evolution has been driven by technological advancements and changing consumer expectations. However, despite these advancements, the user interface of many ATMs remains outdated, often leading to user dissatisfaction and inefficiencies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Current Research in Neuroscience

Current research in neuroscience has revealed critical insights into how the brain processes information, learns from experiences, and makes decisions. Studies on cognitive load, attention, and emotional responses provide valuable frameworks for understanding user experiences with technology. Neuroscientific research has also highlighted the importance of user engagement and motivation in technology adoption, suggesting that designs that align with human cognitive processes can lead to improved user satisfaction.

#### Examination of Existing ATM Technologies

Existing ATM technologies have focused primarily on security measures, transaction speed, and reliability. However, there is a lack of emphasis on user experience design. Current ATM interfaces often present challenges such as complex navigation, unclear instructions, and inadequate feedback mechanisms. These shortcomings can lead to user frustration and increased transaction times, ultimately impacting customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience and financial technology. While there is extensive research on user experience in technology, few studies have specifically addressed how neuroscientific principles can inform the design of ATMs. This presents an opportunity to explore the potential benefits of applying neuroscientific insights to enhance ATM services, ultimately leading to improved user experiences and operational efficiencies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, are computational models that process information through interconnected nodes (neurons). These networks are capable of learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. In the context of ATMs, neural networks can be utilized to analyze user interactions and adapt interfaces based on user behavior.

#### User Experience Design

User experience (UX) design encompasses principles of usability and user-centered design, focusing on creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. Key concepts in UX design include empathy, accessibility, and iterative testing. By integrating these principles with neuroscientific insights, we can create ATMs that are not only functional but also engaging and intuitive.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Adaptive Learning Systems

Adaptive learning systems are designed to modify their behavior based on user interactions, learning from past experiences to improve future performance. In the context of ATMs, this could involve dynamically adjusting transaction flows based on user preferences and behaviors, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.

#### Predictive Maintenance Models

Predictive maintenance models leverage historical data to forecast potential system failures and optimize maintenance schedules. By applying neural network concepts to ATM transaction data, we can develop models that predict when an ATM is likely to require maintenance, minimizing downtime and improving service reliability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines neural network principles with ATM transaction processes. The model illustrates how user interactions can inform system adaptations, leading to more efficient and satisfying user experiences. This framework serves as a foundation for the research methodology and empirical investigations presented in subsequent chapters.
