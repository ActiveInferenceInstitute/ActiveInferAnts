# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of the Free Energy Principle (FEP)

## Executive Summary

This dissertation embarks on a pioneering exploration of the intersection between negotiation theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). It proposes a transformative framework that redefines negotiation as a dynamic process aimed at minimizing variational free energy. By integrating principles from cognitive science with established negotiation methodologies, this research uncovers new insights into interpersonal dynamics, enhances negotiation strategies, and fosters collaborative outcomes. The findings are poised to revolutionize both negotiation practices and theoretical frameworks in cognitive science, yielding significant implications for education, industry, and societal interactions.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Negotiation has traditionally been understood as a process of dialogue and compromise aimed at achieving mutually beneficial agreements. This understanding is rooted in various theoretical frameworks, including game theory and integrative bargaining, which emphasize rational decision-making and the importance of communication. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems, including human cognition, operate to minimize variational free energy, thus maintaining stability in the face of uncertainties. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, presenting negotiation as an adaptive system that can be analyzed through the lens of FEP. By reconceptualizing negotiation in this manner, we can better understand the underlying cognitive processes that drive negotiation behavior and decision-making.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of negotiation theory with the Free Energy Principle is groundbreaking, as it opens up new avenues for understanding complex social interactions and decision-making processes. This research not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of negotiation but also has practical implications for enhancing negotiation practices across various cultural contexts. By framing negotiation as an adaptive process that seeks to minimize variational free energy, we can develop more effective strategies that account for the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of human interactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation seeks to address the following research questions:
1. How can negotiation be conceptualized as a process of minimizing variational free energy?
2. In what ways can active inference inform negotiation strategies and tactics?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of negotiation and FEP, and how can they be empirically tested?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Negotiation Theories and Methodologies

Negotiation theory has evolved significantly over the past several decades, with various models and frameworks emerging to explain the complexities of negotiation processes. Early theories, such as distributive bargaining, focused on the competitive aspects of negotiation, emphasizing the importance of power dynamics and resource allocation. In contrast, integrative bargaining models highlight the potential for collaborative outcomes, focusing on mutual gains and the importance of understanding the interests and needs of all parties involved. More recent approaches, such as interest-based negotiation and principled negotiation, further emphasize the importance of communication, relationship-building, and the exploration of underlying interests.

#### Historical Development of the Free Energy Principle and Its Implications for Cognitive Science

The Free Energy Principle, originally proposed by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy to maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes, as it suggests that human cognition is fundamentally an inferential process, where individuals generate predictions about their environment and update these predictions based on sensory input. The principles of active inference and predictive coding, which stem from the FEP, offer a framework for understanding how individuals navigate uncertainty and make decisions in complex environments.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Contemporary Negotiation Strategies and Their Effectiveness

Contemporary negotiation strategies have increasingly recognized the importance of psychological and emotional factors in negotiation processes. Research has highlighted the role of empathy, trust, and rapport in facilitating successful negotiations. Additionally, the advent of technology and data analytics has transformed negotiation practices, enabling negotiators to leverage information and insights to inform their strategies. Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in understanding how cognitive processes, as framed by the FEP, influence negotiation outcomes.

#### Analysis of the Application of FEP in Understanding Adaptive Systems and Cognitive Processes

The application of the Free Energy Principle in cognitive science has led to significant insights into how individuals adapt to their environments. The concepts of active inference and predictive coding have been utilized to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena, from perception to decision-making. However, the application of these principles to social dynamics, particularly in negotiation contexts, remains underexplored. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by integrating negotiation theory with the FEP, providing a novel perspective on how cognitive processes shape negotiation behavior.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of negotiation theory and the Free Energy Principle presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research. Despite the rich theoretical frameworks present in both domains, there is a notable lack of research that bridges the two fields. This gap presents an opportunity to develop new frameworks that incorporate principles from both negotiation theory and cognitive science, ultimately enhancing our understanding of negotiation processes and outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in Negotiation

Prominent theories in negotiation include game theory, which provides a mathematical framework for understanding strategic interactions, and integrative bargaining, which emphasizes the collaborative aspects of negotiation. Game theory, particularly the Nash equilibrium, offers insights into how rational agents navigate competitive scenarios, while integrative bargaining highlights the importance of understanding interests and fostering collaboration.

#### Fundamental Concepts of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key concepts, including active inference and predictive coding. Active inference refers to the process by which agents minimize prediction error by updating their beliefs and taking actions that align with their predictions. Predictive coding, on the other hand, posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on the discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. Together, these concepts provide a framework for understanding how individuals adapt to their environments and make decisions in uncertain contexts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Conceptualization of Negotiation Dynamics as Variational Free Energy Minimization

This dissertation proposes a novel conceptualization of negotiation dynamics framed as a process of minimizing variational free energy. By viewing negotiation as an adaptive system that seeks to reduce uncertainty and align expectations, we can better understand the cognitive processes that underpin negotiation behavior. This perspective shifts the focus from static strategies to dynamic interactions, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in negotiation contexts.

#### Development of a Framework for Understanding Cultural Norms as Markov Blankets in Negotiation

Cultural norms play a significant role in shaping negotiation strategies and behaviors. This dissertation introduces the concept of cultural norms as Markov blanketsâ€”boundary conditions that influence the flow of information and the dynamics of negotiation. By framing cultural norms in this manner, we can explore how they shape negotiation processes and outcomes, offering insights into culturally adaptive negotiation strategies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

#### Presentation of a Model that Integrates Negotiation Strategies with Predictive Models from FEP

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes insights from negotiation theory and the Free Energy Principle, illustrating how negotiation strategies can be understood through the lens of predictive models. This model emphasizes the interplay between negotiation tactics and prediction error minimization, highlighting the dynamic nature of negotiation as an adaptive process.

#### Visualization of the Interactions Between Negotiation Tactics and Prediction Error Minimization

A visual representation of the integrated model can be constructed to depict the interactions between negotiation tactics and the process of minimizing prediction error. This visualization will serve as a tool for understanding the complexities of negotiation dynamics and the role of cognitive processes in shaping negotiation outcomes.
