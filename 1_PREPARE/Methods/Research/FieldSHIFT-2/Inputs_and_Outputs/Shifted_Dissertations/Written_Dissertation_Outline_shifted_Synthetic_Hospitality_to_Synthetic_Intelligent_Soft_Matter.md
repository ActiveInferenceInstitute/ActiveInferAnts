# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience strategies has been marked by an increasing emphasis on personalization and quality service. The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), is a cornerstone in understanding service quality, providing a framework for evaluating gaps between customer expectations and perceptions. Additionally, the experiencescape model posits that the physical environment, along with social interactions, significantly influences customer satisfaction. Historical advancements in these theories underscore the importance of tailoring experiences to individual preferences, setting a precedent for integrating similar principles into material design.

### Intelligent Soft Matter

The development of stimuli-responsive materials has revolutionized materials science, allowing for the creation of substances that can react to environmental changes. Early advancements in this field focused on hydrogels and shape-memory alloys, which demonstrated the potential for materials to adapt their properties in response to external stimuli. Recent innovations, such as self-healing polymers and bio-inspired materials, highlight the ongoing evolution within this domain. Understanding these historical advancements is crucial for identifying how principles from guest experience can inform the design of intelligent materials.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Guest Experience

Current trends in personalization and sustainability reflect a shift in consumer expectations, where individuals seek experiences tailored to their preferences and values. The role of technology, including mobile applications and AI-driven recommendations, has become increasingly prominent in enhancing service quality. Research indicates that organizations that effectively leverage technology to personalize experiences can achieve higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Intelligent Soft Matter

Recent innovations in soft materials include the development of multifunctional materials capable of sensing, responding, and adapting to their environments. However, challenges remain in scalability and the integration of multiple functionalities within a single material system. The current state of knowledge highlights the need for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from user experience and materials science, paving the way for the development of intelligent materials that prioritize user satisfaction.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that combines user experience with materials design. This gap presents opportunities for developing sustainable and personalized intelligent materials that can enhance user interaction and satisfaction. By addressing these gaps, this research aims to contribute to the academic discourse while providing practical solutions for industry challenges.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Theories of consumer behavior in hospitality provide a robust foundation for understanding how user experiences can inform material design. The principles of responsiveness and adaptability in materials science, particularly in the context of intelligent soft matter, further enrich this theoretical framework. By synthesizing these insights, the dissertation seeks to develop a cohesive understanding of how user-centric design principles can be applied to material innovation.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Responsive Experience Theory

Responsive Experience Theory posits that user interaction with materials can enhance functionality and satisfaction. This theory suggests that materials designed with user feedback in mind can adapt to individual preferences, thereby improving the overall user experience.

### Material Quality Assurance Model

The Material Quality Assurance Model is proposed as a framework for assessing intelligent materials based on user experience metrics. This model emphasizes the importance of evaluating materials not only on their physical properties but also on their ability to meet user expectations and enhance satisfaction.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A comprehensive model that integrates user experience principles with materials design is proposed, emphasizing adaptability, sustainability, and user satisfaction. This model serves as a guiding framework for future research and development in the field of intelligent soft materials.
