## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The financial services industry is undergoing a significant transformation due to technological advancements and changing consumer expectations. Traditional banking models, which have historically relied on in-person interactions and physical branches, are increasingly challenged by the rise of digital banking. The proliferation of smartphones and internet connectivity has facilitated a shift toward self-service banking, where consumers seek greater autonomy over their financial transactions. Concurrently, ATM transactions exemplify a successful model of self-service banking, characterized by security, efficiency, and accessibility. ATMs have evolved from basic cash dispensers to multifunctional platforms offering a range of banking services, thus serving as a critical touchpoint for consumers. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains by transposing ATM principles into the financial services landscape, thereby enhancing the overall user experience and addressing the needs of underserved populations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to leveraging established ATM transaction principles to address current challenges in financial services. By focusing on user-centric design and security protocols, the study aims to create innovative solutions that enhance the digital banking experience and promote financial inclusion for underserved populations. The integration of ATM principles into digital banking has the potential to streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction. Furthermore, this research contributes to the theoretical discourse on digital banking by proposing new constructs that emerge from this transposition, ultimately informing future research and practice.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by three primary research questions:

1. How can ATM transaction principles be effectively integrated into digital banking platforms?
2. What impact do these integrations have on user experience, security, and financial inclusion?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this transposition, and how can they inform future research and practice?

The objectives of this research are to identify best practices for integrating ATM principles into digital banking, evaluate the effects of these integrations on user experience and financial inclusion, and contribute to the theoretical framework surrounding digital banking.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of ATM technology has significantly impacted banking practices over the past few decades. The first ATM was introduced in the late 1960s, revolutionizing the way customers accessed cash and conducted transactions. Initially limited to cash withdrawal, ATMs have expanded to offer services such as balance inquiries, fund transfers, and bill payments. This evolution reflects broader trends in consumer behavior, where convenience and speed have become paramount.

In parallel, digital banking has emerged as a dominant force in the financial services sector, driven by advancements in technology and shifts in consumer preferences. The transition from traditional banking practices to digital platforms has not only changed how consumers interact with their financial institutions but has also raised questions about security, privacy, and accessibility.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research on ATM transactions highlights their efficiency, security measures, and user experience. Studies have shown that ATMs reduce transaction times and enhance customer satisfaction through self-service capabilities. Additionally, security protocols, such as encryption and biometric authentication, have been crucial in building user trust in ATM transactions.

In the realm of digital banking, research has identified several barriers to entry, including technological literacy, access to devices, and concerns about security. The importance of financial inclusion has gained prominence, with scholars advocating for solutions that address the needs of underserved populations. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the integration of ATM principles into the digital banking landscape.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of ATM principles into digital banking presents numerous opportunities for innovation. Despite the extensive research on both domains, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that explore how ATM transaction concepts can be transposed to enhance digital banking. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by identifying best practices and proposing a theoretical framework that synthesizes insights from both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Two foundational theories inform this research: self-service technology theory and security and trust frameworks in financial transactions. Self-service technology theory posits that consumers prefer to engage in self-service options that provide them with greater control and autonomy. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of digital banking, where users seek convenient and efficient transaction methods.

Security and trust frameworks emphasize the importance of security measures in fostering user trust. In financial transactions, trust is paramount, as consumers must feel confident that their personal and financial information is protected. The integration of robust security protocols derived from ATM practices can enhance user trust in digital banking platforms.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From this research, two new theoretical constructs emerge: the Digital Self-Service Banking (DSSB) framework and the Secure Transaction Protocols (STP) model. The DSSB framework encapsulates the principles of self-service, efficiency, and user autonomy in digital banking. It emphasizes the importance of user-centric design and the need for financial institutions to prioritize customer experience.

The STP model focuses on the security measures necessary to protect users in digital transactions. Drawing from ATM security protocols, this model outlines best practices for enhancing security in digital banking, thereby fostering user trust and promoting financial inclusion.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes ATM transaction principles with digital banking paradigms. The model encompasses the key aspects of self-service, security, efficiency, and accessibility, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between these elements in the digital banking context. By establishing this model, the research aims to contribute to the theoretical discourse on digital banking and inform future studies in the field.
