## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

The evolution of neuroscience has progressed from early anatomical studies of the brain to sophisticated neuroimaging techniques and computational neuroscience. Early pioneers, such as Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal, laid the groundwork by demonstrating the neuron as the fundamental unit of the nervous system. The advent of neuroimaging technologies, such as fMRI and PET scans, has enabled researchers to observe brain activity in real-time, leading to significant advancements in our understanding of cognitive functions and neural circuitry. Furthermore, the rise of computational neuroscience has facilitated the modeling of neural dynamics and information processing, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of brain function.

#### RxInfer.jl

Probabilistic programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in machine learning and artificial intelligence, allowing researchers to model uncertainty and make inferences about hidden variables. RxInfer.jl is a notable framework that leverages these principles, providing a flexible environment for building probabilistic models. Its development has been influenced by advancements in Bayesian inference and graphical models, which have paved the way for sophisticated algorithms capable of handling complex data structures. The integration of probabilistic programming with principles from neuroscience has the potential to enhance these models, making them more adaptive and robust.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research trends in neuroscience emphasize the importance of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. This concept has profound implications for understanding learning and memory. Additionally, advancements in neural network modeling have drawn inspiration from biological processes, leading to the development of deep learning architectures that mimic the hierarchical organization of the brain.

In the realm of probabilistic programming, recent advancements have focused on improving the efficiency and scalability of inference algorithms. RxInfer.jl has made significant strides in this area, yet there remains a gap in the incorporation of adaptive mechanisms that reflect the dynamic nature of biological systems. This dissertation seeks to address these gaps by proposing algorithms that are informed by neuroscience principles.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, several gaps remain. In probabilistic programming, there is a lack of adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adjust to changing data distributions. Conversely, neuroscience has underutilized computational models to simulate cognitive processes, limiting the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration. This research aims to bridge these gaps by integrating adaptive learning mechanisms and dynamic inference algorithms into RxInfer.jl, thus fostering innovative solutions and insights that can benefit both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theories in neuroscience, such as Hebbian learning, emphasize the importance of synaptic strength in learning processes. The principle "cells that fire together, wire together" highlights how repeated activation of neurons leads to strengthened connections, forming the basis for learning and memory. Neural coding theories explore how information is represented in the brain, with various coding schemes (e.g., rate coding, temporal coding) providing insights into how sensory information is processed.

#### Probabilistic Programming Theories

Probabilistic programming is grounded in Bayesian inference, which allows for the updating of beliefs based on new evidence. Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, provide a structured way to represent dependencies among variables. Message-passing algorithms facilitate efficient inference in these models, enabling the propagation of information across the network.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From the integration of neuroscience and probabilistic programming, new theoretical constructs such as "Neural Graphs" and "Plasticity Algorithms" emerge. Neural Graphs represent a synthesis of neural circuitry and graphical models, allowing for a more biologically plausible representation of probabilistic relationships. Plasticity Algorithms draw upon synaptic plasticity principles to create adaptive learning rates and model adaptation mechanisms, enhancing the performance of inference algorithms.
