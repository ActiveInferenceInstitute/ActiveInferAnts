## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Spatial Web represents a convergence of physical and digital realms, enabling seamless interactions through augmented and virtual realities. This technological paradigm shift has been catalyzed by advancements in mobile computing, sensor technologies, and the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT). In contrast, ATM transactions have traditionally relied on static interfaces, often resulting in limited user engagement and a lack of personalization. This dissertation investigates how principles from the Spatial Web can enhance ATM functionality, creating a more interactive and user-centric banking experience.

The ATM, since its inception in the late 1960s, has served as a critical interface for self-service banking. However, despite its widespread adoption, user experiences have often been marred by cumbersome interfaces, security concerns, and a lack of contextual relevance. The integration of Spatial Web technologies into ATM transactions has the potential to address these issues by providing a more immersive and intuitive user experience, thereby transforming the way customers interact with banking services.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Spatial Web

The evolution of augmented and virtual reality technologies has been marked by significant milestones, from the early conceptualization of virtual environments to the current applications of mixed reality in various sectors. The Spatial Web encompasses a range of technologies that facilitate immersive interactions, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies enable users to interact with digital content in a spatial context, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

User-centric design has emerged as a fundamental principle in the development of spatial web technologies, emphasizing the need for intuitive interfaces and personalized experiences. The integration of data from multiple sources, including geolocation and user behavior analytics, has further advanced the potential of the Spatial Web to create contextually relevant interactions.

#### ATM Transactions

The development of ATMs has evolved from simple cash-dispensing machines to complex financial service platforms. The functionalities of ATMs have expanded to include a wide range of banking services, such as deposits, transfers, and bill payments. However, challenges remain in user experience, security, and interoperability. User experience studies have highlighted the need for more engaging interfaces and streamlined interactions to improve customer satisfaction.

Security concerns have also been a significant barrier to user trust in ATM transactions. Issues such as card skimming, phishing attacks, and unauthorized access have necessitated the implementation of robust security measures. The current state of ATM technology reflects a reactive approach to security, often responding to threats rather than proactively addressing user concerns.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in spatial web technologies have demonstrated their applicability across various industries, including retail, healthcare, and education. These advancements have highlighted the potential for enhancing user engagement and operational efficiency through immersive experiences. However, the banking sector has been slower to adopt these technologies, often relying on traditional methods that may not meet the evolving expectations of tech-savvy consumers.

Current ATM technologies have seen incremental improvements, such as the introduction of touchscreen interfaces and contactless transactions. However, user experience studies indicate that these upgrades have not sufficiently addressed the deeper issues of engagement and personalization. The integration of spatial web technologies into ATM transactions presents an opportunity to redefine the user experience and create a more interactive banking environment.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of spatial web technologies into banking represents a significant research gap. While there is a growing body of literature on augmented reality and digital twins, few studies have explored their combined application in the context of ATM transactions. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for innovation in enhancing ATM interfaces and user engagement.

The potential for spatial web technologies to create personalized banking experiences through location-based services further underscores the need for research in this area. By leveraging geospatial data and user behavior analytics, banks can tailor their offerings to meet the specific needs of individual customers, thereby increasing user satisfaction and loyalty.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User Experience Theory

User experience (UX) theory emphasizes the importance of usability and user-centered design in creating effective interfaces. This theory posits that a positive user experience is achieved when products are designed with the end-user in mind, incorporating principles of accessibility, intuitiveness, and engagement. In the context of ATM transactions, applying UX principles can lead to more satisfying and efficient interactions.

#### Systems Theory

Systems theory provides a framework for understanding the interconnectivity of components within ATM networks. This theoretical perspective highlights the importance of considering the broader ecosystem in which ATMs operate, including the interplay between hardware, software, and user interactions. By adopting a systems approach, this research can better understand the implications of integrating spatial web technologies into ATM transactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Augmented Interaction Theory

Augmented Interaction Theory posits that user engagement can be significantly enhanced through the integration of augmented reality interfaces. This framework emphasizes the role of immersive experiences in fostering meaningful interactions between users and technology. In the context of ATMs, augmented reality can facilitate more intuitive navigation and interaction, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction.

#### Dynamic User Profiling

Dynamic User Profiling is a theoretical construct that leverages geospatial data to create personalized banking experiences. This theory suggests that by continuously analyzing user behavior and preferences, banks can tailor their services to meet the specific needs of individual customers. The integration of dynamic user profiling into ATM transactions can enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing contextually relevant offers and services.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines elements from both domains to enhance ATM transactions through spatial web technologies. The model will incorporate principles from user experience theory, systems theory, augmented interaction theory, and dynamic user profiling to create a comprehensive framework for understanding the impact of spatial web technologies on ATM transactions.
