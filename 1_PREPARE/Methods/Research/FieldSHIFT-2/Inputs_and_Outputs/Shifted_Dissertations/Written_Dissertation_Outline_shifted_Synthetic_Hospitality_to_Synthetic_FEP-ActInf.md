# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Guest Experience in Hospitality to the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes an innovative exploration of the intersection between guest experience in hospitality and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), aiming to create a new framework for understanding and enhancing interactions within the hospitality sector. By analyzing the principles of guest experience through the lens of FEP, this research seeks to develop novel hypotheses and theoretical constructs that can revolutionize both fields. The study's outcomes have the potential to significantly impact hospitality management practices, inform educational curricula, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately leading to improved guest satisfaction and sustainable operational practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalized services, quality interactions, and technological integration. In this context, guest experience encompasses not only the tangible aspects of services rendered but also the emotional and psychological dimensions of guest interactions. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle offers a robust theoretical framework for understanding adaptive systems, positing that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This dissertation aims to merge these domains, creating a comprehensive understanding of how principles from cognitive science can inform hospitality practices.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the decades, shifting from a purely transactional interaction to a holistic engagement that encompasses emotional, social, and experiential dimensions. The rise of customer-centric models in the late 20th century emphasized the importance of personalization and service quality, leading to the development of various frameworks aimed at understanding and enhancing guest satisfaction. Notable contributions include Pine and Gilmore's (1999) experience economy model, which categorizes experiences into four realms: entertainment, education, escapism, and aesthetics. 

#### Development of the Free Energy Principle and Its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Karl Friston (2010), posits that living systems maintain their states by minimizing free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle has its roots in thermodynamics and information theory, suggesting that biological organisms must continually update their internal models of the world to reduce uncertainty and maintain homeostasis. The FEP has been applied across various domains, including neuroscience and psychology, providing a robust framework for understanding adaptive behavior in complex systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Existing Literature on Guest Experience Strategies and Their Effectiveness

Current literature on guest experience emphasizes the critical role of personalization, service quality, and technological integration. Studies have shown that tailored services can lead to heightened guest satisfaction and loyalty (Kwortnik & Thompson, 2009). However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate cognitive theories, such as the FEP, into hospitality practices.

#### Examination of the Current Applications of the Free Energy Principle in Cognitive Science and Biology

In cognitive science, the FEP has been utilized to explain phenomena such as perception, decision-making, and social interaction. Researchers have applied the principles of predictive coding to understand how individuals construct their realities based on sensory inputs and prior experiences (Clark, 2013). Despite its broad applicability, the integration of FEP into practical domains like hospitality has been limited, presenting an opportunity for further exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Current Hospitality Research Regarding Cognitive Frameworks

While there is extensive research on guest experience, few studies have explored the cognitive underpinnings of these interactions. The lack of cognitive frameworks in hospitality research limits the understanding of how guests process experiences and make decisions. 

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Integrating FEP Concepts into Hospitality Practices

Integrating FEP concepts into hospitality practices presents a unique opportunity to enhance guest experiences through predictive modeling and adaptive service design. By understanding guest behavior as a dynamic process of prediction and feedback, hospitality managers can develop more effective strategies for engagement and satisfaction.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Theories of Guest Experience: Personalization, Service Quality, and Technology Integration

Theories surrounding guest experience emphasize the importance of personalization and service quality in shaping guest perceptions. Personalization involves tailoring services to individual preferences, while service quality is often assessed through dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles (Parasuraman et al., 1988). Technology integration plays a crucial role in facilitating these personalized experiences, allowing for real-time data collection and analysis to anticipate guest needs.

#### Key Concepts of the Free Energy Principle: Active Inference, Predictive Coding, and Entropy Minimization

The FEP introduces several key concepts that can be applied to hospitality. Active inference refers to the process by which agents update their beliefs about the world based on sensory inputs, while predictive coding posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about incoming sensory information. Entropy minimization relates to the tendency of systems to seek states of lower uncertainty, which can be applied to understanding guest satisfaction and engagement.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of the Predictive Guest Model

The Predictive Guest Model posits that guests engage in a continuous process of prediction and updating based on their experiences. This model emphasizes the role of prior experiences, expectations, and environmental cues in shaping guest perceptions and satisfaction.

#### Conceptualization of Entropy-Driven Guest Satisfaction

Entropy-Driven Guest Satisfaction suggests that guests derive satisfaction from experiences that align with their expectations and values. By minimizing entropy, hospitality providers can create environments that foster positive guest interactions and enhance overall satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines guest experience principles with FEP constructs illustrates how they interact to enhance hospitality outcomes. This model posits that by understanding guest experiences through the lens of predictive coding and active inference, hospitality providers can develop strategies that anticipate guest needs and preferences, ultimately leading to improved satisfaction and loyalty.
