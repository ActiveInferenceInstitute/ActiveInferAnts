## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of Buckminster Fuller’s Contributions to Design Science and Sustainability
Buckminster Fuller was a pioneer of design science, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness of systems. His work on geodesic domes and Dymaxion concepts illustrated the potential for innovative design to address complex problems, particularly in the context of resource management and sustainability. Fuller’s philosophies, including the notion of "Spaceship Earth," advocate for a responsible stewardship of resources, which aligns closely with contemporary sustainability efforts.

#### Examination of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality
The concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved significantly over the years, transitioning from a purely transactional relationship to a more experiential and emotional connection. Historically, guest experience was defined by the quality of service and amenities; however, with the rise of technology and changing consumer expectations, the focus has shifted toward creating memorable, personalized experiences. This evolution underscores the need for innovative frameworks that can adapt to the dynamic nature of guest expectations.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Analysis of Existing Literature on Holistic Design and Systems Thinking
Holistic design and systems thinking provide valuable insights into how various components of a service ecosystem interact to influence guest experience. Existing literature emphasizes the importance of viewing hospitality as a system where every element, from physical space to service delivery, contributes to the overall guest experience. This perspective aligns with Fuller's principles, which advocate for an integrated approach to design and problem-solving.

#### Review of Contemporary Practices in Guest Experience Management
Current practices in guest experience management increasingly incorporate technology and personalization strategies to enhance satisfaction. The use of data analytics, mobile applications, and AI-driven services has transformed how guests interact with hospitality providers. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the integration of sustainability and holistic design principles into these practices, presenting an opportunity for further exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
#### Identification of Gaps in the Integration of Sustainability and Technology in Guest Experiences
Despite the growing emphasis on sustainability, many hospitality businesses struggle to effectively integrate eco-friendly practices into their operations. Moreover, the role of technology in facilitating sustainable practices and enhancing guest experiences has not been thoroughly examined. This gap highlights the need for research that bridges these domains, offering a comprehensive framework for integrating Fuller’s principles into hospitality.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Collaboration
The intersection of design science, hospitality management, and sustainability presents numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together experts from various fields, this research can foster innovative solutions that address the challenges facing the hospitality industry while promoting sustainable practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Systems Theory: Understanding Interconnectedness in Service Delivery
Systems theory posits that entities are interconnected and that changes in one component of a system can affect the entire system. In hospitality, this theory can be applied to understand how various elements—such as service delivery, guest interactions, and environmental practices—interact to shape the overall guest experience. This interconnectedness is pivotal for developing a holistic approach to hospitality management.

#### Design Science: Application of Design Principles to Solve Complex Problems
Design science focuses on creating artifacts that solve complex problems through innovative design. In the context of hospitality, design principles can guide the development of environments and services that enhance guest experiences while promoting sustainability. By leveraging design science, hospitality providers can create solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing, aligning with Fuller’s vision of design as a means of problem-solving.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Synergetic Guest Experience Model: Emergent Properties of Guest Interactions
The Synergetic Guest Experience Model posits that guest experiences are co-created through interactions between guests and service providers. This model emphasizes the importance of collaboration and engagement, suggesting that a more participatory approach to experience design can lead to greater satisfaction and loyalty.

#### Tensegrity Service Teams Theory: Adaptability in Service Structures
Tensegrity, a term coined by Fuller, refers to a structural system that maintains stability through the balance of tension and compression. In hospitality, this theory can be applied to service teams, suggesting that cross-trained, flexible staff can respond more effectively to guest needs. This adaptability can enhance service delivery and improve guest satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes Fuller’s principles with elements of guest experience, creating a comprehensive framework that encompasses holistic design, sustainability, and technology. This model serves as a foundation for exploring how these concepts can be operationalized within the hospitality industry to enhance guest experiences.
