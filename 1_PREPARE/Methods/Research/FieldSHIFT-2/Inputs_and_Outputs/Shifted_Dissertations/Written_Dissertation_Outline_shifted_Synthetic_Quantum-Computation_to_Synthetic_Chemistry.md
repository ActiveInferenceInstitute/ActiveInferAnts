## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of quantum computation has fundamentally changed our approach to information processing, while the study of chemical reactions has developed through classical theories of kinetics and thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics emerged in the early 20th century, challenging classical notions of determinism and introducing probabilistic interpretations of physical systems. Conversely, the study of chemical reactions has its roots in classical thermodynamics and kinetics, which have shaped our understanding of how molecules interact and transform.

The historical development of these fields lays the groundwork for their integration. Early quantum chemists, such as Walter Heitler and Fritz London, began to explore the implications of quantum mechanics in chemical bonding, but the full potential of quantum principles in reaction dynamics has yet to be realized. Recent advances in quantum computing technology, particularly in quantum simulation and algorithm development, provide the tools necessary to bridge this gap.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current quantum computation techniques, such as quantum simulation and quantum cryptography, are well-established. Quantum simulation, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex quantum systems that are intractable using classical methods. In contrast, the field of chemical reactions is characterized by extensive studies on reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and catalysis. However, the intersection of these domains remains largely unexplored. While some researchers have begun to apply quantum algorithms to chemical problems, a comprehensive framework that integrates quantum mechanics with chemical reaction dynamics is still lacking.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This research identifies significant gaps in the literature regarding the application of quantum concepts to chemical systems, highlighting opportunities for new theoretical models, experimental validation, and practical applications. The existing literature predominantly focuses on classical models of chemical reactions, with limited exploration into how quantum effects can influence reaction pathways and kinetics. By addressing these gaps, this dissertation aims to contribute to the development of a new interdisciplinary field that combines quantum mechanics and chemistry.
