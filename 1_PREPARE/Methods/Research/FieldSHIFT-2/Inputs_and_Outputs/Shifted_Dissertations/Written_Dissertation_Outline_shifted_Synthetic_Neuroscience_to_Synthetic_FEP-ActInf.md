## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved significantly since its inception, characterized by key developments such as the discovery of the neuron as the fundamental unit of the nervous system, the formulation of the neuron doctrine, and the elucidation of synaptic plasticity. Foundational theories, including Hebbian learning, have underscored the importance of experience in shaping neural connections. Synaptic plasticity, encompassing long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), has been pivotal in understanding learning and memory.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle, initially articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems maintain their integrity by minimizing free energy. This principle has far-reaching implications, suggesting that organisms continuously update their internal models to predict sensory input, thus driving behavior. The FEP has evolved from early formulations of Bayesian inference and predictive coding, positioning itself as a unifying framework for understanding adaptive systems across biology, cognition, and artificial intelligence.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET scans, have provided unprecedented insights into brain activity and connectivity. Research on neuroplasticity has revealed the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize itself in response to learning and experience. Additionally, studies on oscillatory brain activity have highlighted the role of neural rhythms in cognitive processes, including attention and memory.

#### Free Energy Principle

The FEP has found applications in various domains, including cognitive science, psychology, and artificial intelligence. It has been instrumental in developing computational models that mimic human cognition and decision-making processes. Recent studies have explored the implications of the FEP for understanding mental disorders, emphasizing its potential to inform therapeutic interventions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges neuroscience and the FEP. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by proposing novel hypotheses and experimental designs that leverage insights from both domains. The integration of neural mechanisms with the FEP framework presents opportunities for advancing our understanding of cognition and behavior in both biological and artificial systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Key theories in neuroscience, such as Hebbian learning and predictive coding, provide a foundation for understanding how neural networks adapt and function. Hebbian learning emphasizes the importance of synaptic strength changes based on activity patterns, while predictive coding posits that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on the difference between expected and actual input.

#### Free Energy Principle

The FEP's theoretical underpinnings include variational inference and predictive processing. Variational inference allows for approximating complex probability distributions, which is crucial for understanding how the brain encodes and processes information. Predictive processing, on the other hand, describes how the brain continually updates its internal models to minimize prediction errors.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research introduces new theoretical constructs, such as Generative Neural Networks (GNN) and Plasticity-Driven Prediction (PDP). GNNs draw parallels between neural networks in the brain and artificial neural networks, emphasizing the generative aspect of neural processing. PDP highlights the role of synaptic plasticity in updating predictive models, suggesting that learning is fundamentally tied to the brain's ability to adapt its internal representations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model combining neural mechanisms with the FEP illustrates the interplay between synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, and predictive coding. This model posits that the brain functions as a generative system, continuously updating its predictions based on sensory input and internal states. It emphasizes the dynamic nature of neural networks and their capacity for adaptation, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding cognitive processes.
