## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the integration of neural networks—both biological and artificial—with the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework that describes how adaptive systems maintain their integrity by minimizing variational free energy. This fusion creates a novel perspective on cognitive processes, emphasizing predictive coding and active inference. Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in pattern recognition and decision-making. Meanwhile, the Free Energy Principle offers a compelling explanation for how biological systems adapt and learn from their environments, positing that they do so by minimizing the difference between their predictions and actual sensory inputs.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, allowing for a deeper understanding of cognitive mechanisms. The novelty lies in the application of neural network dynamics to the principles of the Free Energy Principle, offering fresh insights into learning, adaptation, and decision-making processes. By creating a framework that synthesizes these domains, this work not only contributes to theoretical discourse but also lays the groundwork for practical applications in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of neural networks inform the understanding of predictive coding within the Free Energy Principle?
2. What role does synaptic plasticity play in updating generative models in response to environmental changes?
3. How can hierarchical structures in neural networks optimize free energy minimization across cognitive levels?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Neural Networks
The development of neural networks can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with significant contributions from pioneers such as McCulloch and Pitts (1943), who proposed the first mathematical model of a neuron. The evolution of these models led to the emergence of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the 1980s, particularly with the introduction of backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986). This algorithm enabled the training of multi-layer networks, leading to breakthroughs in various applications, including image and speech recognition.

#### Free Energy Principle
The Free Energy Principle, rooted in thermodynamics and information theory, was popularized by Friston (2010) as a framework for understanding biological systems. It posits that living organisms strive to minimize free energy, which can be interpreted as the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs. This principle has been applied to various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and robotics, providing a unifying theory for adaptive behavior.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Neural Networks
Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of complex architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have significantly improved performance in tasks such as natural language processing and image classification. Moreover, research on explainable AI seeks to enhance our understanding of how these networks make decisions, drawing parallels with cognitive processes.

#### Free Energy Principle
Current research on the Free Energy Principle emphasizes its applications in predictive coding and active inference. Predictive coding models suggest that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on new information. Active inference extends this idea by positing that organisms actively sample their environments to minimize prediction error.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a lack of integrated models that explicitly connect neural network dynamics with the Free Energy Principle. This dissertation aims to address this gap by exploring how the principles of neural networks can inform and enhance our understanding of predictive coding and adaptive behavior within the framework of the Free Energy Principle.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Neural Network Theories
Key theories in neural networks include Hebbian learning, which posits that synaptic connections strengthen when neurons fire together, and backpropagation, which allows for the efficient training of multi-layer networks. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, plays a crucial role in learning and memory formation.

#### Free Energy Principle Theories
The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the concepts of predictive processing and active inference. Predictive processing suggests that the brain constructs internal models of the world to predict sensory input, while active inference posits that organisms act to reduce prediction error by engaging with their environment.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation introduces new constructs such as "Generative Neural Networks" and "Hierarchical Free Energy Architecture." Generative Neural Networks combine the principles of generative modeling with neural network dynamics, while Hierarchical Free Energy Architecture emphasizes the importance of hierarchical organization in cognitive processes.
