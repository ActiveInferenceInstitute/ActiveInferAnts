# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neuroscience into the Context of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through the lens of active inference. By transposing key neural mechanisms into the framework of predictive processing, this research intends to elucidate the underlying principles that govern cognition and behavior. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of neural adaptability, learning, and decision-making, ultimately leading to transformative applications in artificial intelligence, education, and mental health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of neuroscience with the Free Energy Principle represents a paradigm shift in cognitive science, emphasizing how neural processes can be understood as generative models that predict sensory input and guide behavior. The FEP posits that biological systems maintain their states by minimizing free energy, which correlates with prediction errors between expected and actual sensory inputs. This integration aims to unify disparate theories and practices, creating a cohesive framework for understanding cognition.

Historically, neuroscience has focused on the structural and functional aspects of the brain, examining how neural networks are formed, how synaptic connections are strengthened or weakened, and how neurotransmission occurs. The FEP, introduced by Karl Friston, provides a theoretical backdrop that connects these neural mechanisms to broader cognitive functions, suggesting that the brain operates as a predictive machine that continuously updates its internal model to minimize surprise.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to recontextualizing established neuroscience principles within the FEP framework. It offers a fresh perspective on neural plasticity, neurotransmission, and oscillatory activity, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these elements contribute to predictive processing and active inference. By framing neural mechanisms as generative models, this research challenges traditional views of cognition that often separate perception, action, and learning.

The implications of this work extend beyond theoretical advancements; they offer practical applications in fields such as artificial intelligence, where understanding predictive processing can lead to the development of more adaptive and intelligent systems. Similarly, in education, insights from this research can inform teaching strategies that align with how the brain learns and adapts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can neural mechanisms inform and enhance our understanding of predictive processing?
2. What are the implications of this integration for learning and adaptation in biological and artificial systems?
3. How can this framework be applied to develop new educational methodologies and AI technologies?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Key developments include the discovery of action potentials, synaptic transmission, and the identification of various neurotransmitters. Foundational theories such as Hebbian learning, which posits that "cells that fire together wire together," have provided insights into how neural networks adapt and strengthen over time. The advent of neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET scans, has further advanced our understanding of brain activity during cognitive tasks, allowing researchers to visualize neural correlates of behavior.

#### Free Energy Principle

The FEP emerged from a confluence of ideas in thermodynamics, information theory, and Bayesian inference. At its core, the principle suggests that biological systems strive to minimize free energy, which can be understood as a measure of surprise or prediction error. This framework has profound implications for understanding adaptive systems, as it posits that organisms continuously update their internal models based on sensory input to maintain homeostasis and adapt to changing environments.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent advancements in neuroscience have highlighted the dynamic nature of neural networks and their capacity for plasticity. Studies on neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and the role of glial cells have expanded our understanding of cognitive processes. Furthermore, research on the connectome—the comprehensive map of neural connections—has provided insights into how different brain regions interact during complex tasks.

#### Free Energy Principle

In cognitive science and psychology, the FEP has been applied to various domains, including perception, action, and decision-making. It has also influenced the development of artificial intelligence, particularly in the creation of algorithms that mimic human-like learning and adaptation. However, the integration of neuroscience with the FEP remains an underexplored area, presenting opportunities for novel hypotheses and experimental designs.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges neuroscience and the FEP. This lack of integration limits our understanding of how neural mechanisms operate within the predictive processing framework. By identifying and addressing these gaps, this dissertation aims to propose novel hypotheses and experimental designs that leverage insights from both domains, ultimately enhancing our understanding of cognition and behavior.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in Neuroscience

Neuroscience is grounded in several pivotal theories that elucidate the mechanisms underlying learning and adaptation. Hebbian learning, for instance, emphasizes the importance of synaptic strength in the formation of neural networks. Predictive coding, another significant theory, posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on incoming data. These theories collectively contribute to our understanding of how neural networks adapt to environmental changes.

#### Discussion of the FEP's Theoretical Underpinnings

The FEP's theoretical underpinnings are rooted in variational inference, a statistical method that allows for the approximation of complex probability distributions. This framework posits that the brain operates as a Bayesian inference machine, continuously updating its beliefs about the world based on sensory input. The FEP provides a unifying theory that connects various aspects of cognition, including perception, action, and learning, under the umbrella of predictive processing.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Generative Neural Networks (GNN)

The concept of Generative Neural Networks (GNN) emerges from the integration of neuroscience and the FEP. GNNs operate on the principle that neural networks can generate predictions about sensory input based on learned experiences. This construct emphasizes the role of neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity in shaping predictive models, highlighting how the brain adapts to new information.

#### Plasticity-Driven Prediction (PDP)

Plasticity-Driven Prediction (PDP) is another theoretical construct that arises from this integration. PDP posits that synaptic plasticity is not merely a byproduct of learning but a fundamental mechanism that drives predictive accuracy. This concept underscores the dynamic interplay between neural adaptation and predictive processing, suggesting that the brain's ability to update its internal models is contingent upon its plasticity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model combines neural mechanisms with the FEP, illustrating the interplay between synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, and predictive coding. This model posits that the brain functions as a generative model, continuously updating its predictions based on sensory input while leveraging synaptic plasticity to enhance predictive accuracy. By framing cognition within this integrated model, the dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles that govern learning and adaptation.
