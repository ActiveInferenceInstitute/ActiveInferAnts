## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical development of neuroscience and materials science reveals a rich tapestry of knowledge that can be synthesized for new applications. Neuroscience has evolved from early anatomical studies of the brain to complex models of brain function, including neural networks and synaptic mechanisms. This evolution has provided a framework for understanding how information is processed and learned within biological systems. Concurrently, materials science has transitioned from traditional materials like metals and ceramics to smart, responsive systems capable of adapting to external stimuli. This shift has led to the development of intelligent soft materials, which are characterized by their ability to respond to changes in their environment.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in neuroscience emphasizes the brain's adaptive capabilities, highlighting mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation. These principles are foundational for understanding learning and memory in biological systems. In contrast, intelligent soft matter research focuses on stimuli-responsive materials that can change their properties in response to external factors such as temperature, light, or pH. However, there is limited exploration of how these two domains can inform one another, creating a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of these fields presents significant research gaps, particularly in understanding how neural principles can enhance material functionality. For instance, while synaptic plasticity is well-studied in biological contexts, its application to material science remains largely unexplored. This dissertation will identify and address these gaps, creating a foundation for future research that integrates neuroscience with intelligent soft matter.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

This approach draws parallels between synaptic transmission in neural networks and the interactions between molecules in intelligent soft matter.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines neural network principles with material science theories will serve as the backbone for experimental designs and theoretical explorations throughout the dissertation. This model will emphasize the importance of adaptability, learning, and responsiveness in both biological and synthetic systems, providing a comprehensive understanding of intelligent soft matter.
