## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical development of neuroscience and materials science reveals a rich tapestry of knowledge that can be synthesized for new applications. Neuroscience has evolved from early anatomical studies, such as those by Galen and Descartes, to complex models of brain function that include computational neuroscience and neurobiology. Similarly, materials science has transitioned from traditional materials like metals and ceramics to smart, responsive systems that can adapt to their environment. This evolution highlights the potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration, particularly in the development of intelligent soft materials that can mimic neural processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in neuroscience emphasizes the brain's adaptive capabilities, with a focus on neural networks that process information through interconnected neurons. Studies in synaptic plasticity have elucidated the mechanisms that underlie learning and memory, revealing how experiences can shape neural connections. In the realm of intelligent soft matter, research has focused on stimuli-responsive materials that change their properties in response to external cues, such as temperature, light, or pH. However, there is limited exploration of how these two domains can inform one another, creating a critical gap that this dissertation aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of these fields presents significant research gaps, particularly in understanding how neural principles can enhance material functionality. For instance, while there is a wealth of knowledge regarding the adaptability of biological systems, this understanding has not been fully transposed into the design of synthetic materials. This dissertation will identify and address these gaps, creating a foundation for future research that leverages insights from neuroscience to inform the development of intelligent soft materials.
