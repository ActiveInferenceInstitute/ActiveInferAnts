## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Insect Biology

Insect biology encompasses a broad spectrum of principles, including metamorphosis, ecological roles, and social structures. Metamorphosis, for instance, is a transformative process that allows insects to adapt to various environmental conditions and life stages. The study of social insects, such as bees and ants, reveals complex communication systems and collaborative behaviors that ensure the survival and efficiency of their colonies.

#### Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has evolved significantly over centuries, transitioning from manual craftsmanship to industrial production. The emergence of synthetic fibers in the 20th century revolutionized textile manufacturing but also introduced environmental challenges. Recent trends emphasize sustainability, with a growing focus on eco-friendly materials and processes that minimize waste and reduce carbon footprints.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Insect Biology

Recent advancements in understanding insect behavior, physiology, and ecological contributions have illuminated the intricate ways in which insects interact with their environments. Research in entomology highlights the adaptive strategies of insects, such as camouflage, mimicry, and chemical defenses, which can inform design principles in textiles.

#### Fabric Industry

Current trends in the fabric industry reflect an increasing demand for sustainable practices, driven by consumer awareness and regulatory pressures. Innovations such as digital printing, biodegradable materials, and circular fashion are reshaping the landscape of textile production. However, the integration of biological insights into these practices remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There exists a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that connects biological principles with textile design. This gap presents opportunities for innovation in sustainability and functionality by applying biological insights to textile production. By bridging these fields, this dissertation aims to uncover novel methodologies that can enhance both aesthetic appeal and environmental responsibility in fabric design.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Biological Adaptation Theory

Biological adaptation theory provides a framework for understanding how organisms, including insects, evolve traits that enhance their survival in specific environments. This theory can inform textile design by encouraging the development of fabrics that respond dynamically to environmental stimuli.

#### Sustainability Theory in Textiles

Sustainability theory in textiles encompasses principles that guide eco-friendly practices, emphasizing the need for materials and processes that minimize environmental impact. This theory underlines the importance of lifecycle assessments and sustainable sourcing in the fabric industry.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Metamorphic Design Theory

Metamorphic design theory proposes a framework for creating textiles that can change properties based on environmental stimuli, much like the metamorphosis observed in insects. This concept encourages designers to think beyond static fabrics, exploring dynamic materials that adapt to user needs and environmental conditions.

#### Biomimicry in Textiles

Biomimicry in textiles involves studying biological processes and structures to inspire innovative design solutions. By examining the mechanisms that underpin insect adaptations, designers can create fabrics that mimic these efficiencies, leading to enhanced performance and sustainability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model is proposed that synthesizes biological principles with textile design methodologies, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and sustainability. This model serves as a guiding framework for future research and practical applications in the fabric industry.
