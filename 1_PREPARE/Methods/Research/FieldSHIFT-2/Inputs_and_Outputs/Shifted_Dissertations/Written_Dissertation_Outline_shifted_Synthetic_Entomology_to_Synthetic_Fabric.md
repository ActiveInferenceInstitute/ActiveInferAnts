Insect biology has long been a subject of fascination for scientists and researchers. Key biological principles, such as metamorphosis, the ecological roles of insects in various ecosystems, and their complex social structures, provide a foundational understanding of these organisms. Metamorphosis, for instance, is a transformative process that allows insects to adapt to changing environments, highlighting the importance of flexibility and resilience in biological systems. Additionally, the study of insect social behavior, particularly in eusocial species like ants and bees, reveals sophisticated communication and collaboration mechanisms that can inform group dynamics in human activities.

#### Fabric Industry

The fabric industry has evolved significantly over the centuries, transitioning from traditional craftsmanship to mass production. This evolution has been accompanied by a growing emphasis on sustainability, as the environmental impacts of textile production become increasingly apparent. The rise of fast fashion has exacerbated issues such as waste, pollution, and resource depletion. Recent trends indicate a shift towards sustainable practices, including the use of organic materials, eco-friendly dyes, and innovative design techniques that minimize environmental impact.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Insect Biology

Recent advancements in insect biology have expanded our understanding of insect behavior, physiology, and ecological contributions. Research has highlighted the intricate relationships between insects and their environments, revealing how insects adapt to various ecological niches. Furthermore, studies on chemical communication, such as pheromonal signaling, have opened new avenues for exploring how insects interact with their surroundings and each other.

#### Fabric Industry

The current state of the fabric industry is characterized by a growing demand for sustainable practices and innovative design. There is a notable shift towards digital design technologies, which allow for more efficient production processes and customization. Additionally, consumer awareness of environmental issues has led to an increased interest in eco-friendly textiles, prompting manufacturers to explore sustainable materials and production methods.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich knowledge bases in both insect biology and the fabric industry, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects biological principles with textile design.

Sustainability theory in textiles encompasses principles guiding sustainable practices within the fabric industry. This includes the use of renewable resources, minimizing waste, and reducing the carbon footprint of production processes. By integrating sustainability theory with biological insights, this dissertation aims to develop a holistic approach to textile design that prioritizes ecological responsibility.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Metamorphic Design Theory

Metamorphic design theory introduces a framework for creating textiles that can change properties based on environmental stimuli. This theory draws inspiration from the metamorphosis observed in insects, suggesting that fabrics can be designed to adapt to various conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or light. This adaptability can enhance the functionality and longevity of textiles, making them more suitable for diverse applications.

#### Biomimicry in Textiles

Biomimicry in textiles refers to the study of how biological processes and structures can inspire innovative design solutions. By examining the adaptations of insects, designers can develop textiles that mimic these natural strategies, resulting in materials that are not only functional but also environmentally sustainable. This approach fosters creativity and encourages a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of biological and textile systems.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes biological principles with textile design methodologies, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and sustainability.
