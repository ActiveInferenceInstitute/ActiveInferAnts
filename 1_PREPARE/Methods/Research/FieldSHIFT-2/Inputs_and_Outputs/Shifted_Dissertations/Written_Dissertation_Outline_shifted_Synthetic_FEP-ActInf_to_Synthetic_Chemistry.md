## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Free Energy Principle and Its Foundational Theories

The Free Energy Principle, introduced by Karl Friston, suggests that biological systems operate under the constraint of minimizing free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This framework has roots in thermodynamics, where free energy is a measure of the work obtainable from a thermodynamic system. The principle posits that living systems continuously update their internal models of the world to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory inputs, thereby maintaining homeostasis and adaptive behavior.

#### Exploration of Traditional Chemical Reaction Theories

Traditional chemical reaction theories have evolved significantly since the advent of kinetic theory and thermodynamics in the 19th century. Key developments include the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of reaction rates, and transition state theory, which provides insights into the energy barriers that must be overcome for reactions to proceed. These theories have largely focused on equilibrium states and deterministic pathways, often neglecting the potential for adaptive behaviors in chemical systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Recent Advancements in the FEP

Recent advancements in the application of the Free Energy Principle have expanded its relevance beyond biology to encompass areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In these fields, the FEP has been utilized to develop algorithms that mimic adaptive behaviors, leading to improved predictive capabilities and decision-making processes. The integration of the FEP into these domains highlights its versatility and potential for interdisciplinary applications.

#### Examination of Current Paradigms in Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms

Current paradigms in chemical kinetics focus on the quantitative analysis of reaction rates and mechanisms, often employing sophisticated computational methods to model complex reaction networks. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that incorporate adaptive system theories into chemical dynamics. This gap presents an opportunity for innovation, as the integration of the FEP could lead to new insights into reaction mechanisms and catalyst design.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary approaches that bridge the Free Energy Principle with chemical dynamics. By integrating adaptive system theories into the study of chemical reactions, researchers can uncover novel insights that challenge traditional paradigms. This dissertation aims to address these gaps by proposing a framework that emphasizes the adaptive nature of chemical processes, ultimately enhancing predictive capabilities and fostering sustainable practices.
