## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine
The evolution of culinary arts has been marked by significant milestones, from the advent of cooking techniques in prehistoric times to the globalization of flavors in contemporary gastronomy. Key cooking techniques, such as roasting, baking, and fermentation, have shaped the way food is prepared and consumed. The cultural significance of cuisine cannot be understated, as it reflects societal values, traditions, and identities. The study of cuisine encompasses not only the scientific aspects of food preparation but also the emotional and psychological dimensions of eating, which are vital to understanding user engagement.

#### ATM Transactions
The history of ATMs dates back to the late 1960s, with the first machine installed in London in 1967. Since then, ATMs have undergone significant technological advancements, evolving from simple cash-dispensing machines to multifunctional devices capable of handling various banking services. Despite these advancements, user experience challenges persist, including interface complexity, accessibility issues, and a lack of personalization. Understanding the evolution of ATMs provides critical insights into the current state of user experience design in financial services.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cuisine
Contemporary trends in culinary arts reflect a growing emphasis on health-conscious cooking, sustainability, and culinary fusion. The rise of plant-based diets, the farm-to-table movement, and the increasing popularity of international cuisines highlight the dynamic nature of food culture. These trends underscore the importance of sensory appeal and user engagement in culinary experiences, which can inform the design of ATM interfaces.

#### ATM Transactions
Current paradigms in ATM design focus on usability, accessibility, and security. Innovations such as contactless transactions, biometric authentication, and mobile integration have transformed the ATM landscape. However, many ATMs still lack user-centric design elements that prioritize sensory engagement and personalization. The analysis of contemporary ATM challenges reveals opportunities for culinary-inspired innovations to enhance user experience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the advancements in both culinary arts and ATM technology, there remains a notable gap in user-centric design within ATM interfaces. The application of culinary-inspired innovations presents an opportunity to fill this gap by creating ATM experiences that are not only functional but also engaging and enjoyable. This dissertation aims to identify and explore these opportunities, proposing a framework for integrating culinary principles into ATM design.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Arts
Theories related to sensory perception, cultural identity, and the psychology of taste provide a foundation for understanding how culinary principles can enhance user experience. Sensory perception theories, such as the sensory interaction theory, suggest that the combination of visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli can significantly influence user satisfaction. Cultural identity theories emphasize the role of food in shaping individual and collective identities, which can inform the personalization of ATM experiences.

#### User Experience Design
User experience design theories focus on usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The principles of user-centered design advocate for the involvement of users in the design process to ensure that products meet their needs and preferences. Additionally, the concept of emotional design highlights the importance of creating products that evoke positive emotional responses, which is particularly relevant when considering the integration of culinary principles into ATM interfaces.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The "ATM Culinary Experience Model" emerges as a new theoretical construct that integrates culinary principles into user experience design. This model posits that by applying sensory design, customization, and contextual relevance, ATMs can provide a more engaging and satisfying user experience. The model serves as a framework for exploring the intersections between culinary arts and ATM transactions, guiding the research and experimentation conducted in this dissertation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model combines culinary aesthetics with ATM functionality to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. This model emphasizes the importance of sensory design, personalization, and contextual relevance in creating ATM interfaces that resonate with users. By leveraging insights from both culinary arts and user experience design, the model aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to enhance ATM transactions through culinary-inspired innovations.
