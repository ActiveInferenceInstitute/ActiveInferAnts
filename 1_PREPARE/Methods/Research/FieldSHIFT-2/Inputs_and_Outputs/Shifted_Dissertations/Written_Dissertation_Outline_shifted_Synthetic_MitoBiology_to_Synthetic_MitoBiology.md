## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Mitochondrial biology, traditionally focused on cellular functions, provides insights into energy production, dynamics, and stress responses. Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, play a crucial role in converting nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell. This process is not merely a biochemical reaction; it involves intricate signaling pathways and responses to cellular stressors, highlighting the adaptability and efficiency of mitochondrial function.

Conversely, organizational dynamics examines how organizations operate and evolve in response to internal and external stimuli. The study of organizational behavior encompasses various aspects, including leadership, team dynamics, culture, and structural design. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, revealing how biological processes can inform organizational strategies. By applying principles derived from mitochondrial biology, organizations can gain insights into optimizing their energy management, enhancing structural adaptability, and fostering a resilient workforce.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of mitochondrial principles into organizational dynamics is novel, offering a unique perspective on enhancing productivity, resilience, and employee engagement. This research has the potential to redefine management practices by providing a biological lens through which to view organizational challenges and opportunities. The implications of this interdisciplinary approach are profound, as it not only advances theoretical knowledge but also offers practical frameworks for organizations to thrive in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment.
