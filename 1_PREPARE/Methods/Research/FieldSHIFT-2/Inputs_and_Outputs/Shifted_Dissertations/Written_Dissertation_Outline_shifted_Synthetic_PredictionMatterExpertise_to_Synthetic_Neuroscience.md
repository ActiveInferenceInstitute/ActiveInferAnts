## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Prediction Matter Expertise
Prediction Matter Expertise has evolved significantly since its inception, with its roots in traditional statistical methods and its growth facilitated by advances in computational power and data availability. Key methodologies within PME include Bayesian inference, expert systems, and ensemble learning, each contributing to the accuracy and reliability of predictions across various fields such as meteorology, finance, and healthcare.

#### Neural Networks
Neural networks, inspired by the human brain's structure, have undergone remarkable transformations since their early conceptualization in the mid-20th century. From the development of perceptrons to deep learning architectures, neural networks have found applications in image recognition, natural language processing, and more. The learning mechanisms of neural networks, including backpropagation and gradient descent, have enabled them to model complex functions and patterns in data.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent advancements in both PME and neural networks have led to the emergence of interdisciplinary approaches, yet significant limitations remain. For instance, while neural networks excel at pattern recognition, they often lack the contextual understanding provided by PME. Conversely, PME methodologies can be rigid and may not adapt well to new data or changing environments. This dissertation seeks to address these limitations by proposing a framework that combines the strengths of both domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the promising developments in both fields, there exists a notable gap in the integration of PME principles into neural network design. Current research often treats these domains in isolation, missing opportunities for cross-pollination that could enhance predictive capabilities. This dissertation aims to address this gap by exploring how the principles of PME can inform and transform neural network architectures, leading to more effective predictive models.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
The theoretical underpinnings of this research draw from systems theory and adaptive learning. Systems theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of components within a system, highlighting the importance of understanding relationships and interactions. Adaptive learning, on the other hand, focuses on the ability of systems to modify their behavior based on new information, a principle that is crucial for both PME and neural networks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation introduces two new theoretical constructs: Cross-disciplinary Neural Learning (CDNL) and Dynamic Adaptation Mechanism (DAM). CDNL posits that neural networks can be enhanced through the integration of knowledge from diverse fields, leading to improved learning outcomes. DAM focuses on the implementation of adaptive mechanisms that allow neural networks to adjust their parameters and structures in response to changing data dynamics.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes PME and neural networks, illustrating their interdependencies and interactions. This model serves as a foundation for developing innovative frameworks that leverage the strengths of both domains, ultimately enhancing the predictive capabilities of intelligent systems.
