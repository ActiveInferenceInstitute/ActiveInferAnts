## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

Cuisine has evolved through cultural exchanges, technological advancements, and environmental factors. The historical significance of food preparation and consumption is deeply rooted in cultural identity and social practices. From the ancient culinary traditions of the Mesopotamians to the modern farm-to-table movement, the evolution of cuisine reflects changing societal values and technological progress. The rise of globalization has further diversified culinary practices, leading to the incorporation of various ingredients and techniques from around the world. However, the exploration of insects as a food source has remained largely peripheral, often overshadowed by more conventional culinary ingredients.

#### Entomology

Entomology has transitioned from a focus on taxonomy to a broader understanding of ecological roles and applications in agriculture and medicine. The historical evolution of this field highlights the importance of insects in ecosystems, particularly their roles in pollination, decomposition, and as a food source for other species. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the potential of insects as sustainable food sources, driven by concerns over climate change, resource depletion, and food security. However, the integration of culinary practices into entomological research remains largely unexplored.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cuisine

Current trends in cuisine emphasize sustainability, health, and the exploration of alternative ingredients. The rise of plant-based diets and interest in local sourcing reflect a shift towards environmentally conscious eating. Chefs and food scientists are increasingly experimenting with novel ingredients, including insects, to create dishes that are both flavorful and sustainable. However, there remains a gap in understanding how culinary techniques can be applied to enhance the palatability and nutritional value of edible insects.

#### Entomology

Research in entomology increasingly focuses on the ecological roles of insects, their interactions with ecosystems, and their potential as sustainable food sources. The challenges of declining insect populations and climate change underscore the need for innovative solutions. Studies have shown that edible insects can provide a rich source of protein, vitamins, and minerals while having a lower environmental impact compared to traditional livestock. Nevertheless, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines culinary arts with entomological studies to explore the full potential of edible insects.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of culinary arts and entomology presents opportunities to address gaps in both fields. There is a lack of research exploring how culinary techniques can enhance insect rearing and consumption, as well as a need for innovative approaches to pest management and conservation strategies. This dissertation seeks to fill these gaps by proposing a framework that integrates culinary principles with entomological research, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable food system.
