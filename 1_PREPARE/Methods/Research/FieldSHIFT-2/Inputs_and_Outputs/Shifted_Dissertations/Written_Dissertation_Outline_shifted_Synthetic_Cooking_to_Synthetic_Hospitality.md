# Transposing Cuisine into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of culinary arts and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By systematically transposing principles from cuisine into the design and delivery of guest experiences, this research aims to enhance guest satisfaction, foster loyalty, and create unique offerings that stand out in a competitive market. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine service delivery, inspire interdisciplinary collaboration, and contribute to both academic theory and practical applications in hospitality management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and guest satisfaction, while the culinary arts emphasize flavor, technique, and creativity. As consumer preferences evolve, there is an increasing demand for experiences that transcend the mere provision of goods and services. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates culinary principles into guest experience design, leveraging the strengths of both domains to create a holistic approach to hospitality.

The intersection of these two fields is not merely an academic exercise but a practical necessity. The contemporary guest seeks not only quality service but also memorable experiences that engage multiple senses. The culinary arts, with their emphasis on flavor, presentation, and creativity, offer rich insights into creating such experiences. By transposing culinary principles into the guest experience framework, hospitality professionals can craft offerings that resonate deeply with guests, thereby enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses a gap in the literature by merging two previously distinct fields. The novelty lies in the application of culinary concepts—such as flavor profiles, cooking methods, and presentation techniques—to enhance guest experiences, offering a fresh perspective on service delivery and engagement. 

The hospitality industry has often overlooked the potential of culinary arts as a tool for enhancing guest experiences. This study aims to fill that gap by providing a structured approach to integrating culinary principles into hospitality practices. The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions, as they hold practical relevance for industry stakeholders seeking to innovate and differentiate their offerings in a competitive landscape.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Culinary Arts and Hospitality Management

The culinary arts have a rich history, evolving from basic sustenance practices to a sophisticated field characterized by diverse techniques, cultural influences, and artistic expression. Historically, cuisine has been a reflection of societal values, technological advancements, and cultural exchanges. The emergence of haute cuisine in France during the 17th century marked a pivotal moment in culinary history, emphasizing the importance of technique, presentation, and flavor balance.

Conversely, the hospitality industry has its roots in ancient civilizations, where communal dining and lodging were vital social functions. The modern hospitality sector has evolved significantly since the establishment of the first hotels in the 18th century, driven by the rise of travel and tourism. The focus has shifted from merely providing shelter to creating memorable experiences that cater to the diverse needs of guests.

#### Key Milestones and Influential Figures in Both Fields

Key figures in culinary arts, such as Auguste Escoffier, revolutionized the industry by introducing systematic approaches to cooking and kitchen organization. In hospitality, pioneers like César Ritz set new standards for service quality and guest experience. The contributions of these figures have shaped the principles and practices that govern both fields today.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Contemporary Research on Flavor Profiles, Cooking Methods, and Guest Experience Design

Current research in culinary arts emphasizes the science of flavor, exploring how taste, aroma, and texture interact to create pleasurable dining experiences. Studies on flavor profiles reveal the importance of balancing ingredients to enhance overall satisfaction. In hospitality, research on guest experience design has focused on the guest journey, emphasizing the need for personalized services that cater to individual preferences.

#### Analysis of Existing Frameworks and Models in Hospitality

Several frameworks exist within hospitality management that address guest experience, such as the Service Quality Model (SERVQUAL) and the Experience Economy framework. However, these models often overlook the potential contributions of culinary arts. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap by integrating culinary principles into existing frameworks, thereby enriching the understanding of guest experience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of the Lack of Interdisciplinary Research Connecting Culinary Arts with Guest Experience

Despite the clear connection between culinary arts and guest experience, there is a noticeable lack of interdisciplinary research that explores how culinary principles can enhance hospitality practices. This gap presents a unique opportunity for innovation, as the integration of these two fields can lead to the creation of distinctive offerings that resonate with guests.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation and Enhanced Guest Engagement

By harnessing culinary arts, hospitality professionals can develop innovative experiences that engage guests on multiple levels. Opportunities include themed dining events, interactive cooking classes, and personalized culinary experiences that cater to individual preferences. This research seeks to explore these opportunities and provide a roadmap for their implementation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theory: Flavor Balancing, Cooking Techniques, and Presentation

Culinary theory encompasses various principles related to flavor balancing, cooking techniques, and presentation. Understanding how different flavors interact and complement one another is crucial for creating memorable dining experiences. Techniques such as sous-vide cooking, molecular gastronomy, and plating aesthetics contribute to the overall perception of a dish and, by extension, the guest experience.

#### Hospitality Theory: Service Quality, Guest Journey, and Experience Design

Hospitality theory focuses on service quality, the guest journey, and experience design. The SERVQUAL model, for instance, identifies dimensions of service quality, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions are essential for understanding how guests perceive and evaluate their experiences in hospitality settings.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Experience Fusion Theory: The Blending of Culinary and Experiential Elements to Create Unique Guest Offerings

Experience Fusion Theory posits that the integration of culinary elements into guest experiences can create unique offerings that enhance overall satisfaction. This theory suggests that when culinary arts are thoughtfully incorporated into hospitality practices, they can elevate the guest experience, leading to increased loyalty and engagement.

#### Flavor of Experience Hypothesis: The Correlation Between Well-Crafted Guest Experiences and Overall Satisfaction

The Flavor of Experience Hypothesis posits that the quality of guest experiences is analogous to the quality of culinary creations. Just as a well-balanced dish elicits pleasure and satisfaction, a well-crafted guest experience can evoke similar feelings. This hypothesis serves as a foundation for exploring the relationship between culinary principles and guest satisfaction.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between culinary principles and guest experience elements. It emphasizes the interplay between flavor profiles, service delivery techniques, and guest engagement strategies. This model serves as a framework for understanding how the transposition of culinary concepts into hospitality practices can enhance guest experiences.
