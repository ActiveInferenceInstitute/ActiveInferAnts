## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and guest satisfaction, while the culinary arts emphasize flavor, technique, and creativity. The convergence of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to enhance the guest experience by leveraging the strengths inherent in both fields. Culinary arts, with its rich history and emphasis on sensory engagement, can provide a fresh lens through which to view guest interactions and service delivery. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates culinary principles into guest experience design, creating a holistic approach that not only meets but exceeds guest expectations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses a gap in the literature by merging two previously distinct fields. The novelty lies in the application of culinary concepts—such as flavor profiles, cooking methods, and presentation aesthetics—to enhance guest experiences, offering a fresh perspective on service delivery and engagement. By examining how culinary principles can be transposed into the design of guest experiences, this study aims to provide insights that can lead to improved guest satisfaction and loyalty.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by the following research questions:
- How can culinary principles be effectively transposed into the design of guest experiences in hospitality?
- What impact does the integration of these principles have on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?

The objectives of this research include:
1. To identify key culinary principles that can be integrated into guest experience design.
2. To evaluate the impact of these integrations on guest satisfaction and loyalty.
3. To develop new theoretical constructs that emerge from the interplay between culinary arts and hospitality.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of culinary arts and hospitality management reflects broader societal changes and cultural developments. Culinary arts have roots that trace back to ancient civilizations, where cooking was not only a means of sustenance but also a form of artistic expression. Influential figures such as Auguste Escoffier revolutionized the culinary world with the introduction of classical French cooking techniques and the brigade system, establishing a framework that still informs modern culinary practices.

Conversely, hospitality management emerged as a distinct field in the 20th century, driven by the expansion of the tourism industry and the increasing demand for quality service. Pioneers in this field, such as Conrad Hilton and J.W. Marriott, emphasized the importance of service quality and guest satisfaction, laying the groundwork for contemporary hospitality practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in culinary arts has focused on flavor profiles, cooking methods, and the sensory experience of food. Scholars have explored how different flavor combinations can evoke emotional responses and influence consumer behavior. In hospitality, research has increasingly centered on guest experience design, service quality, and the guest journey. Models such as the SERVQUAL framework have been developed to assess service quality across various dimensions, including tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy.

Despite the wealth of knowledge in both fields, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting culinary arts with guest experience. This gap presents opportunities for innovation and enhanced guest engagement, suggesting that the integration of culinary principles into hospitality practices could yield significant benefits.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in the literature highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research that merges culinary arts with hospitality management. Opportunities for innovation include the development of unique dining experiences, the personalization of guest interactions based on culinary preferences, and the creation of themed events that celebrate diverse culinary traditions. By exploring these opportunities, this research aims to contribute to the evolution of hospitality practices and enhance the overall guest experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical framework for this dissertation draws upon foundational theories from both culinary arts and hospitality management. Culinary theory encompasses concepts such as flavor balancing, cooking techniques, and presentation aesthetics. These principles guide chefs in creating dishes that are not only delicious but also visually appealing, engaging multiple senses.

In hospitality theory, key concepts include service quality, the guest journey, and experience design. The guest journey framework emphasizes the importance of understanding the various touchpoints that shape a guest's experience, from pre-arrival to post-departure. This understanding is crucial for designing experiences that resonate with guests and foster loyalty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes two new theoretical constructs that emerge from the integration of culinary principles into guest experience design:

1. **Experience Fusion Theory**: This theory posits that the blending of culinary and experiential elements can create unique offerings that enhance the guest experience. By integrating culinary principles into service delivery, hospitality providers can craft experiences that are memorable and emotionally resonant.

2. **Flavor of Experience Hypothesis**: This hypothesis suggests a correlation between well-crafted guest experiences and overall satisfaction. Just as flavor profiles can evoke specific emotions and responses, the design of guest experiences can significantly influence guest perceptions and loyalty.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between culinary principles and guest experience elements. This model serves as a framework for understanding how the application of culinary concepts can enhance various aspects of the guest experience, including personalization, service delivery, and relationship building.
