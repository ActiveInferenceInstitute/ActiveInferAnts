## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalization, quality service, and sustainable practices. The evolution of this sector can be traced back to its origins, where service was primarily transactional. However, over the decades, the emphasis has shifted towards creating memorable experiences for guests, leading to the development of various frameworks and metrics aimed at measuring guest satisfaction. Concurrently, blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force characterized by decentralization, transparency, and immutable records. Originally conceptualized as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies, blockchain has expanded into various sectors, including supply chain management, healthcare, and finance.

This dissertation investigates how principles of guest experience can reshape blockchain technology, leading to innovative solutions that enhance user engagement and satisfaction. By leveraging the strengths of both fields, the research seeks to propose a framework that not only enhances the technical capabilities of blockchain but also aligns them with the emotional and experiential needs of users.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on blockchain applications. The novelty lies in the integration of user-centric hospitality principles into the technical framework of blockchain. This approach posits that a focus on guest experience can lead to more effective and engaging digital platforms. By emphasizing personalization, quality assurance, and sustainability, the research aims to establish a new paradigm in which technology serves to enhance human experience rather than merely automate processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience be integrated into blockchain technology to enhance user engagement?
2. What are the implications of personalized smart contracts for user satisfaction in blockchain applications?
3. How can blockchain technology be utilized to promote sustainable practices in the hospitality industry?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the years. Initially focused on the transactional nature of service, the hospitality industry gradually recognized the importance of emotional engagement and personalization. Pioneering theories such as the Service Quality Theory (Parasuraman et al., 1988) have laid the groundwork for understanding service delivery through dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. The emergence of customer experience management (CEM) as a discipline further emphasizes the need for businesses to create holistic experiences that resonate with guests on multiple levels.

#### Development of Blockchain Technology and Its Foundational Principles

Blockchain technology emerged in the late 2000s with the introduction of Bitcoin. It operates on principles of decentralization, immutability, and transparency, allowing for secure and verifiable transactions without the need for intermediaries. The foundational elements of blockchain include cryptographic hashing, consensus algorithms, and distributed ledgers. As the technology matured, applications expanded beyond cryptocurrencies to include smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and various use cases across industries.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Existing Research on Guest Experience Metrics and Frameworks

Current literature on guest experience emphasizes the need for personalization and emotional engagement. Metrics such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) have been widely adopted to gauge guest satisfaction. Recent studies have explored the role of technology in enhancing guest experience, particularly through mobile applications and online platforms. However, there remains a gap in understanding how emerging technologies like blockchain can further enhance these metrics.

#### Examination of Blockchain Applications Across Various Industries

Blockchain has found applications in various sectors, including finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Research has highlighted its potential to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency. However, there is limited exploration of its applications in the hospitality industry, particularly in relation to guest experience. Most existing studies focus on the technical aspects of blockchain without considering the user experience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of the Lack of User-Centric Approaches in Blockchain Research

Despite the transformative potential of blockchain, the existing literature often overlooks user-centric approaches. Most studies focus on the technical and economic implications of blockchain, neglecting the human experience. This presents a significant opportunity for research that integrates hospitality principles into blockchain development.

#### Opportunities for Integrating Hospitality Principles to Enhance Blockchain Applications

The integration of hospitality principles into blockchain applications offers a unique opportunity to enhance user engagement. By focusing on personalization, service quality, and sustainability, blockchain can be positioned as a tool for improving guest experiences rather than merely a backend technology.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory in Hospitality

Service Quality Theory posits that the quality of service is a crucial determinant of customer satisfaction. This theory has been extensively studied in the hospitality industry, leading to the development of various frameworks for measuring service quality. The SERVQUAL model, for example, identifies five dimensions of service quality that are critical for enhancing guest experiences.

#### Theories of Decentralization and Consensus in Blockchain Technology

Theories of decentralization and consensus are foundational to blockchain technology. Decentralization allows for distributed control, reducing the reliance on a single entity. Consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, ensure that transactions are validated by multiple participants, enhancing security and trust.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### The Guest-Centric Blockchain Model

The Guest-Centric Blockchain Model proposes a framework that prioritizes user experience in blockchain applications. This model emphasizes the importance of personalization, service quality, and sustainability, aligning blockchain technology with the emotional and experiential needs of users.

#### Quality Consensus as a New Approach to Transaction Validation

Quality Consensus introduces a novel approach to transaction validation, integrating service quality metrics into consensus mechanisms. This approach aims to enhance the overall user experience by ensuring that transactions meet predefined quality standards.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines guest experience principles with blockchain technology, illustrating their interconnections and mutual benefits. This model serves as a foundation for the subsequent research, guiding the development of methodologies and experiments.
