## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was a visionary architect, designer, and futurist whose contributions to design science and sustainability have had a lasting impact. His concepts of "Spaceship Earth," "comprehensive anticipatory design," and "synergetics" emphasize the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of systems and the need for sustainable practices in design. Fuller's work encourages a holistic view of problem-solving, advocating for solutions that are efficient and environmentally sound.

Conversely, quantum computation emerged from the principles of quantum mechanics in the mid-20th century, revolutionizing our understanding of information processing. Quantum computers leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to perform calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers. The development of quantum algorithms, such as Shor's and Grover's algorithms, has showcased the potential of quantum technologies to solve complex problems in cryptography, optimization, and simulation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
The existing literature on Fuller's philosophies highlights their application across various domains, including architecture, urban planning, and environmental design. However, there is a dearth of research that explicitly connects these principles with the field of quantum computation. Current advancements in quantum computing focus primarily on algorithm development, error correction, and hardware improvements, with limited exploration of the ethical and sustainable implications of these technologies.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the intersection of technology and sustainability, particularly in the context of green computing and energy-efficient algorithms. However, the integration of holistic design principles, such as those proposed by Fuller, remains largely unexplored within the quantum computing landscape.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that combines sustainability with quantum technologies. This presents an opportunity to develop new models and frameworks that address both computational efficiency and ecological impact. By leveraging Fuller's anticipatory design science and systems theory, this dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing innovative solutions that align with contemporary societal needs.
