## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Entomology

Entomology, as a scientific discipline, has evolved significantly since its inception. Key milestones include the establishment of taxonomy by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century, the development of ecological theories in the 20th century, and the advent of molecular entomology in recent decades. Each of these phases has contributed to a deeper understanding of insect behavior, physiology, and ecology. Methodologies have shifted from purely observational studies to include experimental approaches, genetic analysis, and computational modeling, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of insect interactions within ecosystems.

#### ATM Transactions

The historical development of ATMs dates back to the late 1960s, with the introduction of the first cash-dispensing machine by John Shepherd-Barron. Over the decades, ATMs have evolved from simple cash withdrawal devices to complex systems capable of performing a variety of banking transactions. Technological advancements, such as the introduction of EMV chip technology, contactless payments, and mobile banking integration, have transformed user behavior and expectations. Analyzing these trends reveals ongoing challenges related to security, user experience, and accessibility that necessitate innovative solutions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent research in entomology has focused on communication mechanisms among insects, including pheromone signaling, collective decision-making, and adaptive behaviors in response to environmental stimuli. These findings highlight the potential for applying biological principles to technological design, particularly in creating systems that are responsive and user-centered.

In the realm of ATM technology, challenges persist, such as high rates of user error, security vulnerabilities, and limited accessibility for diverse user groups. Current literature indicates a need for more adaptive and intuitive interfaces that can cater to the varying needs of users, particularly in an increasingly digital banking environment.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both entomology and ATM technology, gaps remain in user engagement and adaptability within ATM systems. The integration of biological principles into technological design presents opportunities for interdisciplinary research that can lead to innovative solutions. By leveraging insights from insect behavior, this dissertation aims to address these gaps and explore new avenues for enhancing ATM functionality and user experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key theories in entomology, such as communication theory and ecological adaptation, provide a foundation for understanding how insects interact with their environments and each other. Communication theory, particularly as it relates to pheromone signaling, offers insights into how information is conveyed in a non-verbal manner, which can be applied to ATM interfaces to facilitate clearer user interactions.

In the realm of technology adoption, existing theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) provide a framework for understanding user behavior in response to technological innovations. These theories can be adapted to incorporate biological principles, creating a more holistic understanding of user experience in banking technologies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The concept of metamorphic transactions emerges as a dynamic user experience model that reflects the adaptability and responsiveness observed in insect behavior. This model posits that ATM transactions can evolve based on user interactions, preferences, and environmental factors, resulting in a more personalized and engaging experience.

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to connect insect behavior with ATM design principles, emphasizing the importance of adaptability, communication, and user engagement. This model will serve as a guiding framework for the empirical research conducted in this dissertation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
