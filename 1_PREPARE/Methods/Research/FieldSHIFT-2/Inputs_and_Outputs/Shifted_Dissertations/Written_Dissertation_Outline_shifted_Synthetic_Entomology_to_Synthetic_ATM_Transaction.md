# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: insect biology, which encompasses the study of insects' life cycles, adaptations, and social behaviors, and ATM transactions, which involve user interactions, transaction security, and network interoperability. This fusion presents an opportunity to apply biological principles to technology, particularly in enhancing user experience and security in financial transactions. The examination of insect behaviors, such as communication, adaptability, and social organization, provides a unique lens through which to analyze and improve ATM systems.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

Insect biology has a rich history, with foundational studies detailing their life cycles, adaptations, and ecological roles. Research has revealed the complexity of insect societies, including communication systems, division of labor, and adaptive strategies for survival. Pioneering work by scientists such as Charles Darwin and more recent studies in behavioral ecology have laid the groundwork for understanding the intricate relationships within insect populations.

Conversely, the development of ATMs has evolved from simple cash dispensers to complex machines capable of various financial transactions, driven by technological advancements and user needs. The first ATM was introduced in the 1960s, revolutionizing banking by providing customers with 24/7 access to their funds. Over the decades, ATMs have incorporated advanced features, including cardless transactions, biometric authentication, and mobile integration, reflecting the ongoing evolution of consumer expectations and security challenges.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in insect biology focuses on areas such as behavioral ecology, evolution, and communication. Studies have demonstrated how insects use pheromones, visual signals, and tactile communication to convey information, coordinate activities, and adapt to environmental changes. The understanding of these mechanisms offers valuable insights into the potential for applying similar strategies in technology.

In contrast, ATM transaction studies emphasize user experience, security measures, and technological interoperability. Research has identified key factors that influence user satisfaction, including interface design, transaction speed, and security perceptions. However, there is limited interdisciplinary research bridging these two domains, presenting an opportunity for this dissertation to contribute to both fields.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The primary gap lies in the lack of interdisciplinary exploration that combines biological principles with financial technology. This research will capitalize on this opportunity by identifying and applying biological analogies to enhance ATM functionality. By integrating insights from insect biology into the design and operation of ATMs, this study aims to address critical challenges in user experience and security, ultimately leading to a more effective and user-friendly banking system.

- **User-Centric Social Structure Theory:** This theory utilizes user feedback to enhance ATM design, drawing parallels to the social structures observed in insect colonies. By fostering a collaborative environment, ATMs can continuously improve their functionalities based on real-time user input.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model integrates biological principles into ATM design, creating a framework that emphasizes adaptability, security, and user interaction. By drawing parallels between insect behaviors and user experiences, this model aims to revolutionize the way ATMs operate, ultimately leading to improved user satisfaction and security.
