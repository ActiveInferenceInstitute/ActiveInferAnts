## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of healthcare and neuroscience represents a transformative paradigm shift, whereby principles traditionally confined to their respective domains are merged to create a more holistic understanding of human health. Historically, healthcare has emphasized patient-centered care, focusing on individual experiences, service quality, and the integration of technology to enhance treatment outcomes. Conversely, neuroscience has concentrated on the biological underpinnings of behavior and cognition, striving to elucidate the complex neural mechanisms that govern human experience. This dissertation posits that by merging these domains, we can yield new insights into brain function and improve mental health outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to redefine how we perceive and study neural processes through the lens of healthcare principles. The novelty lies in the creation of a framework that enhances our understanding of neuroscience while introducing a new lexicon and methodologies that can bridge gaps between disciplines. By applying patient-centered care principles to neural processes, this research aims to foster a deeper understanding of the subjective experiences associated with cognitive and emotional health.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to the study of neural processes?
2. What are the implications of enhancing neural interactions for cognitive and emotional health?
3. How can neurotechnological advancements be utilized to improve patient outcomes in mental health?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of the Evolution of Healthcare Principles
The concept of patient-centered care emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the traditional biomedical model, which often neglected the psychological and social dimensions of health. Pioneering works such as those by Balint (1969) and McWhinney (1997) emphasized the importance of understanding patients' experiences, preferences, and values in the context of their care. This shift has led to the development of frameworks that prioritize the patient's voice in treatment decisions, ultimately enhancing the quality of care.

#### Historical Developments in Neuroscience
Neuroscience has a rich history marked by significant discoveries that have shaped our understanding of the brain and behavior. From the identification of neurons by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in the late 19th century to the advent of neuroimaging technologies in the 20th century, the field has continuously evolved. Key milestones, such as the discovery of neuroplasticity by Michael Merzenich and others, have underscored the brain's capacity for change in response to experience, providing a critical foundation for understanding the interplay between neural mechanisms and patient experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Examination of Contemporary Research in Healthcare
Recent literature emphasizes the importance of patient experience and service quality in healthcare delivery. Studies have shown that patient-centered approaches lead to improved health outcomes, greater patient satisfaction, and enhanced adherence to treatment regimens (Epstein & Street, 2011). The integration of technology, such as telemedicine and digital health tools, has further facilitated the personalization of care, allowing for more tailored interventions based on individual patient needs.

#### Review of Current Neuroscience Literature
In contemporary neuroscience, research on neural plasticity, cognition, and emotional responses has gained prominence. Investigations into the neural correlates of emotion regulation, for instance, have revealed the intricate connections between brain regions involved in emotional processing and cognitive control (Ochsner & Gross, 2005). Furthermore, advancements in neuroimaging techniques, such as functional MRI and EEG, have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamic nature of brain activity during various cognitive tasks.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps remain in the application of patient-centered methodologies to neuroscience research. The lack of a cohesive framework that integrates patient experiences with neural processes presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. By bridging these gaps, this dissertation aims to illuminate the ways in which patient-centered care principles can inform our understanding of neural mechanisms, ultimately enhancing cognitive and emotional health outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Patient-Centered Care Theory
The Patient-Centered Care Theory posits that healthcare should be tailored to the individual needs and preferences of patients. This approach emphasizes the importance of communication, empathy, and shared decision-making in the therapeutic relationship. By prioritizing the patient's perspective, healthcare providers can foster a more supportive and effective treatment environment.

#### Service Quality Theory
Service Quality Theory, articulated by Parasuraman et al. (1988), provides a framework for understanding the dimensions of service quality that influence patient satisfaction. The SERVQUAL model identifies five key dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions can be applied to enhance patient experiences in both healthcare and neuroscience contexts.

#### Neuroplasticity and Behavioral Theories
Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections in response to learning and experience. This concept has profound implications for understanding how patient experiences can shape neural processes over time. Behavioral theories, such as the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) framework, emphasize the relationship between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, highlighting the importance of addressing cognitive patterns in therapeutic interventions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
#### Neural Experience Hypothesis
The Neural Experience Hypothesis posits that neural interactions can be conceptualized as experiences that are shaped by individual perceptions, emotions, and contexts. This hypothesis suggests that understanding neural processes through the lens of patient experiences can lead to more effective interventions in mental health.

#### Synaptic Quality Theory
Synaptic Quality Theory proposes that the efficiency and resilience of synaptic connections play a crucial role in emotional regulation and cognitive performance. By assessing synaptic quality, researchers can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to mental health outcomes.

#### Neurotechnology for Patient-Centric Neuroscience
This construct emphasizes the role of neurotechnological advancements in enhancing patient-centered approaches to neuroscience. By utilizing tools such as neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces, researchers can create personalized interventions that align with individual patient needs and experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integrated theoretical model combines patient-centered care principles with neuroscience, illustrating their interconnections and implications. This model posits that enhancing patient experiences can lead to improved neural interactions, ultimately resulting in better cognitive and emotional health outcomes. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, this model aims to bridge the gap between healthcare and neuroscience, paving the way for innovative therapeutic approaches.
