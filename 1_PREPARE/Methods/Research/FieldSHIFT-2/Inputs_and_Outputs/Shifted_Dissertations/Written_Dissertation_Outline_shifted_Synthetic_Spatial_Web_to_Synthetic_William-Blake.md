# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Spatial Web represents a convergence of physical and digital realms, enabled by advancements in AR, VR, the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing. This domain facilitates real-time interactions and personalized experiences, reshaping how we engage with information and environments. The integration of these technologies allows for a more dynamic interaction with content, creating opportunities for deeper exploration and understanding. William Blake's work, characterized by its rich interplay of poetry and visual art, provides a fertile ground for exploring the implications of this technological shift. Blake's exploration of duality—manifested in his contrasting themes of innocence and experience, heaven and hell, and the material and spiritual—aligns seamlessly with the dualities presented in the Spatial Web, where the physical and digital coexist and inform one another.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to applying Spatial Web technologies to the interpretation and teaching of Blake's work. By creating interactive and immersive experiences, it challenges traditional methods of engagement with art and literature, promoting a deeper understanding of Blake's themes in contemporary contexts. The integration of AR and VR technologies not only enhances the aesthetic and intellectual appreciation of Blake's contributions but also fosters a more inclusive and participatory learning environment. This study aims to contribute to the growing field of Digital Humanities, providing a framework for how technology can enrich the humanities and promote interdisciplinary collaboration.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Spatial Web

The Spatial Web has evolved from earlier digital platforms, integrating AR, VR, and IoT to create interconnected environments. The concept of the Spatial Web is rooted in the evolution of the internet and digital technologies, moving from static web pages to dynamic, interactive experiences. The historical development of the Spatial Web can be traced through several key phases:

1. **The Internet Era:** The initial creation of the internet allowed for information sharing but lacked immersive experiences.
2. **Web 2.0:** The advent of social media and user-generated content introduced interactivity but still remained largely text-based.
3. **The Spatial Web:** The current phase integrates physical and digital realms, allowing for real-time interactions and personalized experiences.

Understanding its historical development provides insights into its current applications and future potential, particularly in how it can be utilized in the humanities to create engaging educational experiences.

### William Blake

Blake's work has been historically contextualized within the Romantic era, emphasizing themes of spirituality, duality, and social critique. His unique synthesis of poetry and visual art challenges conventional boundaries, and a review of existing literature reveals both the depth of his contributions and the challenges in interpreting his multi-faceted art. Scholars have emphasized Blake's innovative use of visual imagery to complement his poetic themes, yet many contemporary interpretations often overlook the potential for interactive engagement that technology can provide.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Spatial Web

Current research highlights the applications of the Spatial Web in various sectors, including education, urban planning, and entertainment. However, its integration into the humanities, particularly art and literature, remains underexplored. The potential for the Spatial Web to enhance engagement with cultural artifacts and literary texts is significant, yet few studies have systematically investigated this intersection.

### William Blake

While there is a rich body of scholarship on Blake, contemporary interpretations often overlook innovative methodologies that could enhance engagement with his work. The intersection of technology and Blake studies presents an opportunity for fresh perspectives. Recent scholarship has begun to explore the digital humanities' potential, but there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks that integrate technology into the study of Blake's contributions.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in applying Spatial Web technologies to the humanities, particularly in the context of Blake's work. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a framework for integrating these technologies into the study and appreciation of Blake's contributions. By leveraging AR and VR, this study seeks to create new avenues for interpreting Blake's themes and enhancing pedagogical practices.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Spatial Web Theories

- **Mixed Reality Theory:** This theory explores the blending of physical and digital environments, emphasizing how users can interact with both realms simultaneously. It provides a foundational understanding of how AR and VR can create immersive experiences that enhance engagement with art.
  
- **User Experience Design:** Principles guiding the creation of interactive experiences are crucial for developing effective AR and VR applications. Understanding user needs and behaviors is essential for designing meaningful interactions that resonate with users.

### Blake's Theories

- **Contraries:** Blake's exploration of opposing forces serves as a lens for understanding human experience. His emphasis on duality—such as innocence versus experience—can be mirrored in the Spatial Web's dual nature, where physical and digital experiences coexist.

- **Imagination and Vision:** The role of personal vision in art and literature is central to Blake's philosophy. This concept can be expanded in the context of the Spatial Web, where individual interpretations can be enhanced through interactive technologies.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Interactive Interpretation:** A framework for understanding how technology can facilitate new forms of engagement with art. This construct emphasizes the active role of users in interpreting Blake's work through interactive experiences.

- **Digital Duality:** This concept explores the coexistence of physical and digital experiences in interpreting Blake's work, highlighting how these realms can inform and enrich one another.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This model synthesizes theories from both domains, proposing a framework that emphasizes interactive engagement and the reinterpretation of Blake's themes through the lens of the Spatial Web. By integrating mixed reality and user experience design with Blake's exploration of duality and imagination, the model aims to create a comprehensive approach to understanding and engaging with his work.
