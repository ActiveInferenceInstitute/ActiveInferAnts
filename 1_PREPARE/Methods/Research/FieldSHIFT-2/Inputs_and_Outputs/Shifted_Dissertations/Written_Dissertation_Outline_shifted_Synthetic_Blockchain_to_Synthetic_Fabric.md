## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Overview of Blockchain Development and Key Milestones
Blockchain technology was first conceptualized in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The underlying principles of blockchain—decentralization, immutability, and transparency—have since been applied to various sectors beyond finance, including supply chain management, healthcare, and the arts. Key milestones in blockchain development include the introduction of Ethereum in 2015, which enabled the creation of smart contracts, and the emergence of various blockchain platforms tailored for specific industries.

#### Historical Challenges Faced by the Fabric Industry
The fabric industry has a long history marked by challenges related to sustainability, ethical production, and consumer demand for transparency. The environmental impact of textile production is staggering, with the industry accounting for approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, labor exploitation and unethical practices in supply chains have drawn increasing scrutiny from consumers and advocacy groups alike. Historical attempts to address these issues have often been met with resistance due to the industry's entrenched practices and lack of transparency.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Examination of Existing Blockchain Applications in Various Industries
Numerous industries have begun to explore the applications of blockchain technology. In supply chain management, companies like IBM and Walmart have implemented blockchain solutions to enhance traceability and transparency. Similarly, the art world has seen the rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which utilize blockchain to verify the authenticity and ownership of digital artworks. However, there remains a significant gap in the exploration of blockchain applications within the fabric industry.

#### Analysis of Current Practices and Challenges in the Fabric Industry
Current practices in the fabric industry often lack transparency, making it difficult for consumers to ascertain the origins of their products. The reliance on complex supply chains further complicates efforts to ensure ethical production and sustainability. Additionally, the industry grapples with issues related to intellectual property theft, particularly in the realm of textile design, where copying designs can occur with relative ease.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a notable lack of research on the applications of blockchain technology in the fabric industry. This gap presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, as the integration of blockchain principles could address critical issues related to sustainability, transparency, and intellectual property protection. By exploring this Shifted Domain, this dissertation aims to contribute valuable insights and practical solutions that can benefit both the fabric industry and the broader field of blockchain technology.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
#### Overview of Decentralization, Immutability, and Transparency in Blockchain
Decentralization is a fundamental principle of blockchain technology, allowing for the distribution of data across a network of nodes rather than relying on a central authority. This characteristic enhances security and reduces the risk of data manipulation. Immutability refers to the inability to alter data once it has been recorded on the blockchain, ensuring a permanent and verifiable record of transactions. Transparency is achieved through the public nature of many blockchain networks, enabling stakeholders to access and verify information independently.

#### Theories Related to Sustainability and Ethical Production in the Fabric Industry
Sustainability in the fabric industry encompasses environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Theories related to sustainable production emphasize the need for responsible sourcing, resource conservation, and ethical labor practices. Ethical production theories advocate for transparency and accountability within supply chains, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and that environmental impacts are minimized.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The integration of blockchain principles with fabric production practices necessitates the development of new theoretical constructs that address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by this Shifted Domain. This dissertation proposes a framework that combines the foundational theories of blockchain and sustainability, creating a holistic approach to understanding the implications of blockchain technology for the fabric industry.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interactions between blockchain technology and fabric industry practices. At the core of the model lies the concept of a decentralized fabric ecosystem, where stakeholders—including manufacturers, designers, consumers, and regulators—collaborate to enhance transparency, sustainability, and ethical production. The model emphasizes the role of blockchain in facilitating communication, tracking materials, and protecting intellectual property rights, ultimately fostering a more responsible and interconnected fabric industry.
