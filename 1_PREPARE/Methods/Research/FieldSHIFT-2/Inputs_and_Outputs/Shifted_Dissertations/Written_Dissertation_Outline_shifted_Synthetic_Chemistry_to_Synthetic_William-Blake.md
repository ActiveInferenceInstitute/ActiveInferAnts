## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of Chemistry, a discipline rooted in the empirical study of matter and its transformations, with the rich, imaginative world of William Blake, an iconic poet and artist. Chemistry, with its focus on the interactions and transformations of substances, offers a unique framework for analyzing artistic processes. Blakeâ€™s works, characterized by their intricate symbolism and profound philosophical inquiries, can be examined through the lens of chemical concepts, revealing parallels between chemical reactions and artistic creation. This approach allows for a fresh examination of Blake's oeuvre, emphasizing the transformative nature of both chemical processes and artistic expression.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the sciences and the humanities, offering a unique perspective on creativity and artistic expression. By applying chemical concepts to literary analysis, this dissertation contributes to the emerging field of interdisciplinary studies. The novelty lies in the innovative application of chemical principles to the analysis of Blake's work, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances our understanding of Blake's artistic endeavors but also provides a framework for future research that bridges the gap between scientific inquiry and literary analysis.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation seeks to address the following research questions:

- How can principles of Chemistry be applied to analyze the themes and structures in Blake's poetry and art?
- What insights can be gained from viewing Blake's creative process through the lens of chemical reactions and principles?
- How does this interdisciplinary approach enhance our understanding of Blake's exploration of dualities and spirituality?

The objectives of this research include establishing a theoretical framework that integrates chemical principles with artistic analysis, conducting a comprehensive examination of Blake's work through this lens, and exploring the implications of this approach for both Chemistry and the humanities.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The development of Chemistry as a scientific discipline traces back to ancient alchemy, evolving through the Enlightenment into a rigorous empirical science. The contributions of key figures such as Antoine Lavoisier, John Dalton, and Dmitri Mendeleev laid the groundwork for modern chemical theory, emphasizing the importance of understanding matter's properties and transformations.

William Blake, born in 1757, lived during a time of significant socio-political upheaval, marked by the American and French Revolutions. His work was influenced by the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism, nature, and the sublime. Blake's unique vision, characterized by a synthesis of poetry and visual art, reflects his engagement with the spiritual and the material worlds, making him a pivotal figure in the exploration of dualities.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing literature on Chemistry provides a comprehensive understanding of its foundational theories, including thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular structure. The methodologies employed in these studies emphasize empirical investigation and theoretical modeling.

In contrast, scholarly interpretations of Blake's poetry and visual art often focus on thematic analysis, historical context, and symbolic interpretation. While there is a rich body of literature on Blake, the intersection of Chemistry and literary analysis remains largely unexplored. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research that integrates chemical principles into the examination of Blake's work.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary approaches in the analysis of Blake's work highlights a significant gap in existing scholarship. By identifying potential methodologies for integrating chemical principles into literary studies, this research opens new avenues for exploration. The Shifted Domain offers a platform for examining the creative process through the lens of Chemistry, revealing insights that can enrich both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key chemical theories relevant to the analysis of Blake's work include:

- **Thermodynamics**: The study of energy transformations and the laws governing heat and work. This theory can be applied to understand the emotional and spiritual energies reflected in Blake's art.
- **Kinetics**: The investigation of reaction rates and the factors influencing them. This concept can provide insights into the speed and intensity of Blake's creative processes.
- **Molecular Structure**: The arrangement of atoms within molecules, which can serve as a metaphor for the structural elements of Blake's poetry and visual art.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of chemical principles into the analysis of Blake's work leads to the development of new theoretical constructs, such as the "Artistic Reaction Model," which posits that personal experiences and external influences act as reactants in the creative process. This model emphasizes the transformative nature of artistic creation, akin to chemical reactions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model illustrates the parallels between chemical processes and Blake's artistic methods. By mapping concepts such as reaction rates, equilibrium, and energy dynamics onto Blake's creative output, this model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between Chemistry and art.

## Methodology
