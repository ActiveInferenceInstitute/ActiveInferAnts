# Domain Transposition: Negotiation in the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of negotiation theory and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a transformative framework that redefines the understanding of both fields. By analyzing Blake's artistic expression as a form of negotiation with societal norms and dualities, the research aims to contribute new insights into conflict resolution, creativity, and human experience. The potential impact includes enriching negotiation practices, enhancing literary analysis, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately leading to a deeper appreciation of the complexities of life and art.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain combines negotiation and literary analysis, focusing on William Blake's works as a rich source for understanding negotiation dynamics. Negotiation is traditionally viewed within the realms of business and conflict resolution, characterized by a systematic approach to reaching agreements. However, Blake's poetry and art present a unique exploration of human experience, spirituality, and social critique, revealing negotiation as a broader concept that transcends conventional boundaries. This dissertation posits that Blake's artistic endeavors can be interpreted as a form of negotiation, reflecting his engagement with the societal and ideological conflicts of his time.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it challenges traditional boundaries between negotiation and literature, offering a novel perspective on how artistic expression can serve as a form of negotiation. By positioning Blake as a negotiator of ideas and values, the study opens new avenues for understanding both negotiation and artistic practices. The implications of this research extend beyond academia; they encompass practical applications in negotiation training, conflict resolution, and literary interpretation, thereby enriching both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation seeks to address the following research questions:

- How does Blake’s negotiation with societal norms reflect broader themes of conflict resolution in art?
- What insights can Blake’s approach to dualities provide for contemporary negotiation practices?
- How can an integrated theoretical model that combines negotiation theory with literary analysis be developed?

The objectives of this research include a comprehensive analysis of Blake's works through the lens of negotiation theory, the identification of key negotiation dynamics within his artistic expressions, and the formulation of a new theoretical framework that bridges these two domains.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Negotiation

Negotiation, as a field of study, has evolved over centuries, with roots in diplomacy, commerce, and conflict resolution. Early theories of negotiation emphasized distributive approaches, focusing on the allocation of limited resources. Key figures such as Roger Fisher and William Ury introduced integrative negotiation, which prioritizes mutual gains and collaborative problem-solving. This shift towards understanding negotiation as a dialogue rather than a mere transaction has profound implications for conflict resolution strategies.

#### William Blake

William Blake (1757-1827) was a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, known for his poetry, visual art, and profound philosophical insights. His major works, including "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and "Jerusalem," reflect a complex interplay of spirituality, social critique, and the exploration of dualities. Understanding Blake's life within the socio-political context of 18th-century England—marked by industrialization, religious upheaval, and social reform—provides essential insights into his artistic motivations and the negotiation of ideas.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary negotiation theories have expanded to include various approaches, such as transformative negotiation, which emphasizes the relational aspects of negotiation, and narrative negotiation, which focuses on the stories that shape negotiations. In literary studies, recent scholarship has delved into Blake's exploration of dualities, such as innocence versus experience, and the tension between the material and the spiritual. However, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary approaches that connect negotiation theory with literary analysis.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate negotiation theory with literary analysis presents a unique opportunity for exploration. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by developing a model that captures the negotiation dynamics inherent in Blake's work while simultaneously enriching negotiation practices with insights drawn from literary analysis. By examining the interplay between artistic expression and negotiation, this research paves the way for innovative approaches to understanding both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Overview of Negotiation Theories

Negotiation theories have traditionally been categorized into two primary approaches: integrative and distributive. Integrative negotiation, as articulated by Fisher and Ury, emphasizes the importance of collaboration and mutual benefit, while distributive negotiation focuses on competitive tactics and resource allocation. Understanding these foundational theories provides a basis for analyzing Blake's work through the lens of negotiation.

#### Key Concepts from Blake's Philosophy

Blake's philosophy is deeply rooted in the concept of contraries, which he articulated as essential to human experience. In his view, oppositional forces—such as good and evil, innocence and experience—are not merely dichotomous but rather interdependent and necessary for understanding the complexity of existence. This notion of contraries serves as a critical framework for analyzing negotiation dynamics in Blake's oeuvre.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Artistic Negotiation

The concept of "artistic negotiation" emerges as a new theoretical construct that integrates negotiation principles with artistic expression. This framework posits that artistic endeavors, like negotiation, involve a dialogue between competing ideas, values, and identities. Blake's work exemplifies this process, as he negotiates with societal norms and personal beliefs through his poetry and visual art.

#### Contrary Strategies

"Contrary strategies" describe Blake's approach to conflicting ideologies, revealing how he navigates tensions and contradictions in his work. By employing these strategies, Blake engages in a form of negotiation that challenges dominant narratives and fosters a deeper understanding of the human condition.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between negotiation dynamics and Blake's artistic processes. This model encompasses key elements such as dialogue, interests, preparation, and strategy, demonstrating how these components manifest in both negotiation scenarios and Blake's creative expressions. By synthesizing these domains, the model provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the negotiation inherent in Blake's work.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This research employs a qualitative design, utilizing literary analysis as the primary methodological approach. By examining Blake's poetry and visual art through the lens of negotiation theory, the study seeks to uncover the negotiation dynamics present in his work.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection involves a two-pronged approach:

1. **Textual Analysis**: A close reading of Blake's poetry and visual art, focusing on themes of negotiation, duality, and societal critique.
2. **Interviews**: Conducting interviews with negotiation experts and literary scholars to gain insights into the intersections of negotiation theory and literary analysis.

### Analytical Approaches

The analysis will employ thematic analysis to identify key negotiation dynamics in Blake's works, as well as comparative analysis to draw connections between negotiation strategies and artistic techniques. This multi-faceted approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the Shifted Domain.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will include ensuring respectful representation of Blake's work and maintaining the integrity of negotiation practices. This involves acknowledging the historical and cultural contexts of both fields and being mindful of the implications of the research findings.
