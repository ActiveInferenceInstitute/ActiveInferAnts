## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that biological organisms strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain their functional integrity. This principle, rooted in thermodynamics and information theory, suggests that living systems are inherently predictive in nature, constantly generating models of their environment to reduce uncertainty and surprise. Insects, as one of the most diverse and ecologically significant groups of organisms, exhibit complex behaviors and adaptive strategies that can be examined through this principle. For instance, their foraging behaviors, social interactions, and responses to environmental changes can be viewed as processes aimed at minimizing free energy. This dissertation seeks to bridge cognitive science and entomology, proposing that insect behavior can be understood as a process of minimizing surprise and optimizing decision-making.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research represents a novel intersection between cognitive science and entomology, proposing that insect behavior can be understood as a process of minimizing surprise and optimizing decision-making. By applying the FEP to insect behavior, this dissertation challenges traditional paradigms in entomology, which often focus on mechanistic explanations of behavior without considering the cognitive processes underlying those behaviors. This interdisciplinary approach opens new avenues for research and application, particularly in the realms of pest management and biodiversity conservation. The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical frameworks; they encompass practical applications that can significantly impact ecological management and conservation strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation will address the following overarching research questions:

1. How can the Free Energy Principle be applied to understand insect behavior?
2. What are the implications of this application for pest management and biodiversity conservation?
3. How can educational frameworks in entomology be transformed through this interdisciplinary lens?

The objectives of this research are to:

- Develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates the FEP with insect behavioral ecology.
- Conduct empirical studies to validate the application of FEP in understanding specific insect behaviors.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle originated in the fields of statistical mechanics and information theory, gaining traction within cognitive science as a framework for understanding adaptive systems. Central to the FEP is the concept of variational free energy, which quantifies the difference between an organism's predictions and actual sensory inputs. This principle has profound implications for understanding how organisms, including insects, engage with their environments, adapt to changes, and make decisions. Key figures in the development of the FEP include Karl Friston, who has extensively explored its applications in neuroscience and psychology, positing that organisms minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference.

#### Insect Biology

Insect biology has a rich historical context, with significant contributions from entomologists such as Charles Darwin and E.O. Wilson. The study of insect behavior, ecology, and taxonomy has traditionally focused on descriptive and mechanistic analyses. Recent advancements have highlighted the complexity of insect social structures, communication, and ecological roles. However, there remains a lack of integration between cognitive theories and entomological studies, which this dissertation aims to address.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### FEP

Current research on the Free Energy Principle emphasizes its role in predictive coding and active inference, demonstrating how organisms anticipate environmental changes and optimize their behaviors accordingly. Studies have shown that the FEP can be applied to various biological systems, including human cognition, but its application to non-human organisms, particularly insects, remains underexplored.

#### Insect Behavior

Recent findings in insect behavior reveal the complexity of their social structures, foraging strategies, and responses to environmental changes. For example, studies have documented sophisticated communication methods in bees and collective decision-making in ant colonies. However, these behaviors are often analyzed in isolation, without consideration of the cognitive processes that may underlie them.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in the integration of cognitive theories, such as the FEP, with entomological studies. This research seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by developing new models of insect behavior based on the principles of predictive coding and active inference. By doing so, it aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of insect behavior that accounts for both ecological and cognitive dimensions.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several key concepts, including:

- **Variational Free Energy**: A measure of the difference between an organism's predictions and actual sensory inputs, which organisms seek to minimize.
- **Markov Blankets**: The boundaries that delineate an organism from its environment, allowing for the distinction between internal states and external influences.
- **Predictive Coding**: The process by which organisms generate predictions about sensory inputs and update these predictions based on new information.

These foundational theories provide the basis for understanding how insects might employ similar strategies in their behavior.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes the development of a framework that combines the FEP with insect behavioral ecology. This framework will explore how insects utilize predictive coding and active inference to navigate their environments, optimize foraging strategies, and engage in social behaviors. By integrating these concepts, this research aims to create a comprehensive model that elucidates the cognitive processes underlying insect behavior.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between free energy minimization and insect behavior. It posits that insects continuously generate predictions about their environment and adjust their behaviors to minimize discrepancies between these predictions and actual sensory inputs. This model incorporates elements of predictive coding and active inference, providing a robust framework for understanding insect behavior in various ecological contexts.

## Core Chapters

### Key Aspect 1 of Shifted Domain: Insect Foraging Strategies

#### Sub-section 1: The Role of Predictive Coding in Foraging

**Hypothesis**: Insects utilize predictive coding to optimize foraging efficiency. 

Predictive coding suggests that organisms create internal models of their environment to anticipate future states. In the context of foraging, insects may predict the availability of resources based on past experiences and environmental cues. 

**Proposed Experiments**: Observational studies will be conducted on various insect species, such as ants and bees, to analyze their foraging patterns in different environments. Researchers will manipulate resource availability to assess how insects adjust their foraging strategies based on predictive coding principles.

#### Sub-section 2: Variational Free Energy in Foraging Behavior

**Hypothesis**: Foraging strategies are driven by the minimization of variational free energy.

Insects may engage in behaviors that reduce surprise and uncertainty while foraging. This can involve optimizing routes, selecting resource-rich areas, and adapting to changes in resource availability.

**Proposed Experiments**: Laboratory simulations will be conducted to manipulate resource distributions and observe how insects make foraging decisions. Statistical analyses will be employed to assess the relationship between resource availability and foraging efficiency.

### Key Aspect 2 of Shifted Domain: Social Insect Behavior

#### Sub-section 1: Collective Decision-Making in Ant Colonies

**Hypothesis**: Ant colonies minimize free energy collectively through information sharing.

Social insects, such as ants, rely on collective decision-making processes that may reflect principles of predictive coding. The sharing of information among colony members can lead to more efficient foraging and resource allocation.

**Proposed Experiments**: Observational studies will be conducted to analyze the decision-making processes in ant colonies during foraging. Researchers will manipulate information availability to assess its impact on collective behavior.

#### Sub-section 2: Bee Communication and Resource Allocation

**Hypothesis**: Bees use active inference to optimize resource allocation within hives.

Bees communicate through complex signaling mechanisms, which may facilitate active inference processes. This allows them to adjust their foraging strategies based on the needs of the hive and environmental conditions.

**Proposed Experiments**: Field studies will be conducted to observe bee foraging behavior and communication patterns. Researchers will analyze how changes in resource availability influence hive dynamics and foraging decisions.

### Key Aspect 3 of Shifted Domain: Environmental Adaptation

#### Sub-section 1: Impact of Climate Change on Insect Behavior

**Hypothesis**: Climate change alters the variational free energy landscape for insects.

As environmental conditions change due to climate change, insects may face new challenges that require adaptations in behavior to minimize free energy. 

**Proposed Experiments**: Longitudinal studies will track insect populations in changing environments, assessing how behavioral adaptations occur in response to climate-related stressors.

#### Sub-section 2: Adaptive Strategies in Urban Environments

**Hypothesis**: Urban insects exhibit unique adaptations to minimize free energy in resource-scarce environments.

Urbanization presents novel challenges for insects, necessitating adaptations in behavior to cope with limited resources and altered habitats.

**Proposed Experiments**: Comparative studies of urban versus rural insect populations will be conducted to assess behavioral differences and adaptations. Researchers will analyze how resource availability and habitat structure influence insect behavior in urban settings.
