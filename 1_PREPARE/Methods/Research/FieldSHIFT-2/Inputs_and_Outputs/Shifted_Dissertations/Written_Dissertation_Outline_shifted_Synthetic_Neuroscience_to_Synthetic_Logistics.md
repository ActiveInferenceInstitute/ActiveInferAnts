Neuroscience has evolved significantly over the past century, with key discoveries illuminating the complexities of neural processing. The identification of neurons as the fundamental units of the nervous system, the understanding of synaptic plasticity as a mechanism for learning and memory, and the development of neural networks as models for information processing have all contributed to our understanding of brain function. These advancements have paved the way for exploring how similar principles can be applied to complex systems beyond biology.

#### Logistics

Logistics, as a discipline, has undergone a remarkable evolution from its origins in military supply chain management to its current status as a critical component of global commerce. The integration of technology, particularly information and communication technologies, has transformed logistics practices, enabling real-time tracking, inventory management, and data-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, traditional logistics models often struggle to adapt to the rapid changes in market conditions, highlighting the need for innovative approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Contemporary research in neuroscience focuses on various aspects, including neural communication, decision-making processes, and adaptive learning mechanisms. Studies have shown that neural circuits can reorganize in response to experiences, a phenomenon known as neural plasticity. This adaptability is crucial for understanding how organisms learn from their environment and make decisions based on changing circumstances.

#### Logistics

Current logistics practices emphasize supply chain optimization, transportation management, and the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics. However, many existing models lack the flexibility to respond dynamically to disruptions or shifts in demand. This gap presents an opportunity to apply insights from neuroscience to enhance the adaptability of logistics systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals several gaps in current logistics research that could benefit from insights derived from neuroscience. For instance, traditional logistics models often rely on static assumptions about demand and supply, failing to account for the dynamic nature of real-world environments. By exploring the principles of neural processing, this dissertation aims to develop interdisciplinary methodologies that leverage the strengths of both fields, ultimately enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of logistics operations.
