## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

The evolution of neuroscience has traversed several key milestones, from early anatomical studies by pioneers such as Galen and Vesalius to the advent of neuroimaging technologies that allow for real-time observation of brain activity. The development of computational neuroscience has further expanded our understanding of neural networks, providing insights into how information is processed and communicated within the brain.

#### Logistics

The historical development of logistics can be traced back to military logistics in ancient civilizations, evolving into modern supply chain management. The integration of technology and information systems has transformed logistics from basic transportation management into a complex web of interconnected processes that require strategic planning and execution.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent advances in neuroimaging and artificial intelligence (AI) applications in brain research have opened new avenues for understanding cognitive processes. Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and machine learning algorithms have provided insights into neuronal communication and plasticity, revealing how experiences shape neural pathways.

#### Logistics

Current trends in logistics emphasize automation, real-time tracking, and sustainable practices. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and AI are being integrated into supply chain operations to enhance efficiency and transparency. However, the application of biological principles to these systems remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that applies biological principles to operational efficiency in logistics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Key theories in neuroscience include the principles of neuronal communication, synaptic plasticity, and network dynamics. Neuronal communication involves the transmission of signals across synapses, while synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, influenced by activity levels. Network dynamics explore how interconnected neurons function as a whole, responding to inputs and adapting to changes.

#### Logistics

Theories of supply chain management encompass optimization, systems theory, and the bullwhip effect. Optimization focuses on maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs, while systems theory examines the interdependencies within supply chains. The bullwhip effect illustrates how small changes in consumer demand can lead to significant fluctuations in supply chain operations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs such as "Supply Chain Plasticity" and "Logistic Neurons" to facilitate the integration of neuroscience principles into logistics. Supply Chain Plasticity refers to the ability of supply chains to adapt and reconfigure in response to changes, while Logistic Neurons symbolize the individual entities (e.g., suppliers, distributors) that communicate and collaborate within the supply chain network.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model illustrates the parallels between neural networks and logistics networks, emphasizing feedback mechanisms and adaptive processes. This model will serve as a foundation for exploring how neuroscience concepts can enhance logistical efficiency and responsiveness.
