In logistics, current trends emphasize automation, real-time tracking, and sustainable practices. The rise of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain has transformed supply chain operations, enabling greater visibility and efficiency. However, despite these advancements, challenges such as supply chain disruptions and environmental sustainability persist.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary research that applies biological principles to operational efficiency in logistics, this section highlights the potential for innovation by bridging these two fields. While both neuroscience and logistics have made significant strides independently, the integration of their principles offers a unique opportunity to address complex challenges in supply chain management. The Shifted Domain presents a fertile ground for exploration, enabling researchers and practitioners to develop new frameworks that enhance adaptability and resilience in logistics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Theories of neuronal communication, plasticity, and network dynamics serve as foundational elements for this research. Neuronal communication, characterized by the transmission of signals between neurons through synapses, is central to understanding how information is processed in the brain. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, is crucial for learning and memory. Network dynamics, which examine how neurons interact within complex networks, provide insights into the collective behavior of neural systems.

#### Logistics

In logistics, theories of supply chain management, optimization, and systems theory underpin the analysis of operational efficiency. Supply chain management theories emphasize the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, while optimization theories focus on maximizing efficiency through resource allocation. Systems theory, which views organizations as interconnected systems, provides a holistic perspective on supply chain dynamics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs such as "Supply Chain Plasticity" and "Logistic Neurons" to facilitate the integration of neuroscience principles into logistics. Supply Chain Plasticity refers to the ability of supply chains to adapt to changing conditions, drawing parallels to synaptic plasticity in neural networks. Logistic Neurons represent the individual components of a supply chain, each contributing to the overall functionality and adaptability of the system.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the parallels between neural networks and logistics networks. This model emphasizes feedback mechanisms and adaptive processes, highlighting how information flows through supply chain networks in a manner analogous to neuronal communication. By visualizing these connections, the model will serve as a framework for understanding how neuroscience principles can inform logistical practices.
