## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Negotiation and blockchain are two distinct fields that, at first glance, may seem unrelated. Negotiation focuses on dialogue and consensus among parties, while blockchain operates as a decentralized ledger technology for secure transactions. However, both domains share commonalities in their reliance on clear communication, ethical considerations, and the need for consensus among multiple stakeholders. Negotiation theories emphasize the importance of understanding interests, fostering collaboration, and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. Similarly, blockchain technology, particularly through consensus mechanisms, necessitates agreement among participants to maintain the integrity of the ledger.

The convergence of these two fields presents an opportunity to enhance blockchain applications through established negotiation strategies. By examining how negotiation principles can inform blockchain design and operation, we can address critical issues such as trust deficits, engagement challenges, and the complexity of user interactions in decentralized systems.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Negotiation

The evolution of negotiation theories has seen significant contributions from scholars such as Fisher and Ury, whose Principled Negotiation framework emphasizes the importance of separating people from the problem, focusing on interests rather than positions, and generating options for mutual gain. Over the decades, negotiation strategies have diversified, encompassing collaborative approaches, competitive tactics, and integrative negotiations that seek win-win outcomes. This historical context illustrates the complexity and dynamism of negotiation as a field of study.

#### Blockchain

Blockchain technology emerged with the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, representing a paradigm shift in how transactions are conducted. Since then, the development of smart contracts and decentralized applications has expanded the capabilities of blockchain, allowing for automated, trustless interactions. Key milestones include the introduction of Ethereum, which enabled programmable contracts, and subsequent advancements in consensus mechanisms such as Proof of Stake and Delegated Proof of Stake. This historical overview highlights the rapid evolution of blockchain and the potential for further innovation through interdisciplinary approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research on negotiation techniques emphasizes the effectiveness of collaborative strategies in fostering trust and achieving favorable outcomes. Scholars are increasingly exploring the role of technology in negotiation, including the use of artificial intelligence and online negotiation platforms.

In the realm of blockchain, advancements are focused on enhancing scalability, security, and usability. Research has addressed the limitations of existing consensus mechanisms, the intricacies of smart contract design, and the implications of decentralized governance. However, there remains a notable lack of interdisciplinary studies that connect negotiation principles with blockchain technology.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Negotiation Theories

Key negotiation theories, such as Fisher and Ury's Principled Negotiation, provide a foundation for understanding how negotiation can be effectively conducted. These theories emphasize the importance of interests, collaboration, and the generation of options that benefit all parties involved. By applying these principles to blockchain technology, we can explore how consensus mechanisms can be designed to facilitate negotiation-like interactions among participants.

#### Blockchain Theories

Blockchain theories, including decentralization and trustlessness, underscore the unique characteristics of blockchain technology. Decentralization removes the need for a central authority, while trustlessness enables transactions to occur without reliance on intermediaries. These theories provide a critical lens through which to examine how negotiation concepts can be integrated into blockchain systems.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
