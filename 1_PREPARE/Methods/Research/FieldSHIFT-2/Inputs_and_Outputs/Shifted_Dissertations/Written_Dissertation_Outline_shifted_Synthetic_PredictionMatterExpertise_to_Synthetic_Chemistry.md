## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The historical evolution of PME has focused on synthesizing knowledge from various disciplines to make informed predictions. The concept of PME emerged from the necessity of integrating diverse data sources and methodologies to enhance decision-making in complex systems. Meanwhile, the study of chemical reactions has developed through understanding fundamental principles such as kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis. The early 20th century saw significant advancements in reaction kinetics, providing a foundation for modern catalysis research. However, the two fields have largely evolved independently, with limited interaction until the recent surge in computational methods and data analytics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in PME emphasizes analytical and intuitive processes, focusing on the ability to predict outcomes based on historical data and real-time inputs. In contrast, chemical reaction studies concentrate on optimizing reaction conditions and understanding mechanisms through empirical experimentation. However, there is limited exploration of how these two fields can inform and enhance one another. The advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence offers a promising avenue for integrating predictive modeling into chemical research, yet challenges remain in effectively translating predictive insights into practical applications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
