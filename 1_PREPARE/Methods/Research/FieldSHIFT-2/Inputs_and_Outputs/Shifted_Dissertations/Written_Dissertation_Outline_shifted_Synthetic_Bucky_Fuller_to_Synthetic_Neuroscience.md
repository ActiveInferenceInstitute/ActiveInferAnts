## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Buckminster Fuller’s Contributions to Design Science and Systems Theory

Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was a visionary architect, designer, and futurist whose work emphasized the importance of holistic thinking and the interconnectedness of systems. His concepts of tensegrity, synergetics, and ephemeralization provide a unique lens through which to view complex systems. Fuller’s design science principles advocate for resource efficiency and sustainability, concepts that are increasingly relevant in contemporary scientific discourse.

#### Examination of Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience

Neuroscience, as a discipline, has evolved dramatically over the past century, with foundational concepts such as neural plasticity, network dynamics, and the role of synaptic connections becoming central to our understanding of brain function. Neural plasticity, in particular, refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life, a concept that aligns with Fuller's emphasis on adaptability and change.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Contemporary Research in Neuroscience

Contemporary neuroscience research has increasingly focused on understanding neural networks and their role in cognitive functions. Techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have allowed researchers to visualize and analyze brain activity in real-time. Current studies explore therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing neuroplasticity, such as cognitive training, mindfulness, and neurofeedback.

#### Analysis of the Application of Systems Thinking in Various Disciplines

Systems thinking has been applied across various disciplines, including architecture, environmental science, and organizational theory. In architecture, for instance, the principles of design science have informed sustainable building practices that prioritize resource efficiency. The application of systems thinking in these fields highlights the potential for interdisciplinary integration, particularly in the context of neuroscience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in the Current Understanding of Neural Systems

Despite significant advancements in neuroscience, there remain gaps in our understanding of neural systems that could benefit from a systems-oriented perspective. Traditional reductionist approaches may overlook the emergent properties of neural networks, which can be better understood through the lens of holistic thinking and design science.

#### Opportunities for Innovation in Therapeutic Strategies and Educational Methodologies

The integration of Fuller's principles into neuroscience presents opportunities for innovation in therapeutic strategies and educational methodologies. By adopting a systems-oriented approach, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective interventions that promote cognitive health and enhance learning outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Holistic Thinking: Systems Theory as Applied to Neuroscience

Holistic thinking, as articulated by Fuller, emphasizes the importance of viewing systems as interconnected wholes rather than isolated parts. In neuroscience, this perspective is critical for understanding the complex interactions between neurons and the emergent properties that arise from these interactions. Systems theory provides a framework for analyzing how individual components of the brain contribute to overall cognitive function.

#### Tensegrity: Structural and Functional Principles in Biological Systems

Tensegrity, a term coined by Fuller, refers to a structural principle in which components are held together by a network of continuous tensile elements. This concept can be applied to biological systems, including neural circuits, to explain how structural integrity is maintained despite the dynamic nature of neural activity. Tensegrity models can provide insights into the organization and function of neural networks, particularly in relation to neuroplasticity.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Neural Tensegrity: Conceptualizing Neural Circuits through Tensegrity Principles

Neural tensegrity proposes that neural circuits can be understood as tensegrity structures, where the balance of tensile and compressive forces allows for stability and adaptability. This model can illuminate the ways in which neural connections are formed and restructured in response to learning and experience, providing a fresh perspective on neuroplasticity.

#### Synergetic Neuroscience: Understanding Collective Neural Behaviors as Emergent Properties

Synergetic neuroscience explores the collective behaviors of neural networks as emergent properties arising from the interactions of individual neurons. This perspective aligns with Fuller's concept of synergy, wherein the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. By examining neural dynamics through this lens, researchers can gain insights into higher-order cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and decision-making.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes Fuller's concepts with neuroscience, emphasizing the interconnectedness and adaptability of neural systems. This model posits that the principles of holistic thinking, tensegrity, and synergetics can provide a comprehensive framework for understanding brain function and cognitive processes. By adopting this interdisciplinary approach, researchers can develop new insights into neuroplasticity and cognitive health.
