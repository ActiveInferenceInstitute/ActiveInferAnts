## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Cognitive Security emphasizes the protection of cognitive processes from manipulation, particularly in the context of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age. It encompasses a wide range of strategies aimed at enhancing individuals' and communities' abilities to discern credible information from falsehoods. The Free Energy Principle, proposed by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle provides a theoretical foundation for understanding adaptive behavior in living systems, suggesting that organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world based on incoming sensory information.

This dissertation investigates the synergies between these domains, positing that cognitive security measures can be interpreted as active inference processes that enhance resilience against cognitive threats. By framing cognitive security within the context of the FEP, we can better understand how individuals and communities can adaptively manage the complexities of information in an increasingly digital landscape.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of Cognitive Security with the Free Energy Principle offers a groundbreaking perspective on how individuals and communities can navigate the complexities of information in an increasingly digital landscape. This novel approach not only broadens the scope of both fields but also presents unique opportunities for empirical research and practical applications. By exploring how cognitive security strategies can be conceptualized as active inference processes, this dissertation aims to contribute to the theoretical discourse on information integrity and cognitive resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The central research questions guiding this dissertation are:

- How can cognitive security strategies be framed as active inference processes?
- What role does predictive coding play in the processing of information and the resolution of misinformation?
