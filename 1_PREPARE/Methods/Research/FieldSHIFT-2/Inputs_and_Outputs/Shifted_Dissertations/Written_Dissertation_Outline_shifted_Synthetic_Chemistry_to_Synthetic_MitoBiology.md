## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Foundational Theories in Chemical Reactions

The study of chemical reactions has laid the groundwork for understanding how reactants transform into products, governed by principles of thermodynamics and kinetics. Thermodynamics provides insights into the energy changes that accompany chemical reactions, establishing criteria for spontaneity and equilibrium. Kinetics, on the other hand, focuses on the rates of reactions and the factors that influence them, such as concentration, temperature, and catalysts. Key theories such as the Arrhenius equation and transition state theory have been pivotal in developing our understanding of reaction mechanisms.

#### Historical Development of Mitochondrial Biology

Mitochondrial biology has evolved significantly since the discovery of mitochondria in the 19th century. Early studies identified mitochondria as the site of cellular respiration, but it was not until the mid-20th century that researchers elucidated the intricacies of the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. The advent of molecular biology techniques has further advanced our understanding of mitochondrial genetics and the role of mitochondria in apoptosis, signaling, and metabolic regulation. 

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Recent Advancements in Chemical Reaction Mechanisms

Recent advancements in chemical reaction mechanisms, particularly in the realm of enzyme catalysis and reaction dynamics, have provided deeper insights into how reactions can be optimized and controlled. The development of techniques such as time-resolved spectroscopy and computational modeling has enabled researchers to visualize and manipulate chemical processes at the molecular level. 

#### Examination of Current Research in Mitochondrial Biology

Current research in mitochondrial biology has revealed the complexity of mitochondrial dynamics, including the roles of mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, and inter-organellar communication. Studies have also highlighted the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndrome, and cancer. However, there remains a significant gap in applying chemical principles to these biological processes, which this dissertation aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in the Literature

Despite the extensive research conducted in both fields, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary studies that apply chemical reaction principles to mitochondrial biology. Most research has focused on either biochemical pathways or chemical kinetics in isolation. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by proposing a framework that integrates these domains.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Research

The intersection of chemical reactions and mitochondrial biology presents numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary research. By leveraging insights from chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, researchers can develop new hypotheses about mitochondrial function and dysfunction, ultimately leading to innovative therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key chemical theories relevant to reaction dynamics include the law of mass action, which describes how the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the concentration of reactants, and the concept of activation energy, which is crucial for understanding how enzymes lower the energy barrier for reactions. 

#### Overview of Mitochondrial Biology Theories

Mitochondrial biology is grounded in theories of bioenergetics, which examine how energy is produced and utilized within cells. The chemiosmotic theory, proposed by Peter Mitchell, elucidates how the electrochemical gradient generated by electron transport drives ATP synthesis.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
