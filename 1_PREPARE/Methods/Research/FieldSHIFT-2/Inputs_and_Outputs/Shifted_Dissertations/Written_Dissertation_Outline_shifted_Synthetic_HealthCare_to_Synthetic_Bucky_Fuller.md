## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The healthcare sector is undergoing a significant transformation as it increasingly recognizes the importance of patient engagement, quality service delivery, and sustainable practices. Traditional models of healthcare delivery often prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness over patient needs, leading to a disconnect between healthcare providers and patients. Concurrently, Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy advocates for holistic, systems-based thinking and innovative design solutions to address global challenges, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all systems.

This dissertation proposes a systematic transposition of healthcare practices through Fuller's principles, creating a novel framework for understanding and improving patient care. By integrating design science, sustainability, and holistic thinking, this research aims to create a healthcare model that is responsive to the needs of patients while simultaneously addressing broader societal challenges.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its potential to bridge two previously distinct fields, offering fresh insights into patient care through the lens of design science and sustainability. The novelty of this approach lies in its interdisciplinary nature, which combines healthcare practices with philosophical principles that prioritize holistic solutions. By integrating these perspectives, the dissertation aims to redefine healthcare practices, enhance patient experiences, and inspire a new generation of interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s design science principles be applied to enhance patient-centered care in healthcare settings?
2. What synergetic outcomes can emerge from integrating service quality with systems thinking in healthcare?
3. In what ways can technology be utilized as an ephemeralization tool to improve healthcare delivery?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Health Care

The evolution of patient-centered care has been marked by a shift from a provider-centric model to one that emphasizes the active involvement of patients in their own care. This transition has been fueled by advancements in technology, increased patient awareness, and a growing body of evidence that supports the benefits of patient engagement. Service quality, defined as the assessment of how well healthcare services meet patient expectations, has become a critical component in evaluating healthcare systems.

#### Buckminster Fuller

Buckminster Fuller’s philosophies, particularly his concepts of holistic thinking, sustainability, and design science, provide a framework for addressing complex global challenges. His idea of "Spaceship Earth" emphasizes the finite nature of resources and the necessity for sustainable practices. Fuller's design science methodology advocates for innovative solutions that consider the interdependence of systems, making it a valuable lens through which to view healthcare.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary healthcare practices increasingly emphasize the importance of patient experience and quality of care. Research has shown that improved patient engagement leads to better health outcomes, reduced costs, and increased patient satisfaction. Meanwhile, Fuller's principles have been applied in various disciplines, including architecture, urban planning, and education, but have yet to be fully explored within the healthcare sector.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing recognition of the importance of interdisciplinary research, there remains a significant gap in the literature linking healthcare and Fuller's philosophies. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring innovative practices that can emerge from this intersection, ultimately contributing to a more holistic understanding of healthcare.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Health Care

Key theories in healthcare include the concepts of patient-centered care, which emphasizes the importance of considering patients' preferences, needs, and values in clinical decision-making. Service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL framework, provide a basis for evaluating healthcare services based on dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. Continuous improvement frameworks, such as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), offer methodologies for enhancing healthcare processes.

#### Buckminster Fuller

Fuller's philosophies are rooted in holistic thinking, which advocates for understanding systems as interconnected wholes rather than isolated parts. His concept of synergetics explores how complex systems can achieve emergent properties through collaboration and cooperation. Design science principles emphasize the importance of creating solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable and equitable.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Design Science Care

Design Science Care emerges as a new approach to healthcare that incorporates patient feedback and systems thinking. This construct emphasizes the importance of designing healthcare systems that are responsive to the needs of patients while also considering the broader context in which they operate.

#### Synergetic Quality

Synergetic Quality is a framework for evaluating healthcare service quality through collaborative outcomes. This construct integrates principles from service quality models and Fuller's synergetics, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in achieving high-quality care.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model developed in this dissertation combines principles from both domains to create a responsive healthcare system. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of healthcare processes, the importance of patient engagement, and the necessity for sustainable practices.

Additionally, case studies of healthcare organizations that have successfully implemented design science approaches will be conducted to provide real-world examples of best practices.

### Analytical Approaches

Thematic analysis will be employed for qualitative data to identify patterns and themes related to the implementation of design science principles. For quantitative data, statistical analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of these principles on patient outcomes and service quality. The development of a "Synergetic Healthcare Model" will facilitate the assessment of outcomes across various healthcare settings.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount in this research, particularly regarding patient confidentiality and informed consent. Measures will be taken to ensure that participants understand the purpose of the research and their rights. Additionally, potential biases in data collection and analysis will be addressed through rigorous methodological practices.
