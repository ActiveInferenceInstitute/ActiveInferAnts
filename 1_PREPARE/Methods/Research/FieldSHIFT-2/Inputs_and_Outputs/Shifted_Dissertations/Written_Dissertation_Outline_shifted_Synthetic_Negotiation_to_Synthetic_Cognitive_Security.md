## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Negotiation

Negotiation as a field of study has evolved significantly over the past century. The early 20th century saw the emergence of key theories such as distributive and integrative negotiation. Distributive negotiation, often characterized as a "win-lose" scenario, focuses on dividing a fixed amount of resources, whereas integrative negotiation promotes a "win-win" approach, aiming for mutual benefit. Scholars such as Fisher and Ury (1981) introduced interest-based bargaining, emphasizing the importance of understanding underlying interests rather than fixed positions. These foundational theories have shaped contemporary negotiation practices and continue to inform strategies in various contexts, including business, diplomacy, and conflict resolution.

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security, on the other hand, is a relatively new field that has gained prominence in response to the rise of misinformation and disinformation, particularly in the digital landscape. The evolution of cognitive security has been marked by the recognition of the psychological and social dimensions of information warfare. Scholars have explored concepts such as threat perception, cognitive biases, and the role of social media in shaping public opinion. The increasing sophistication of disinformation campaigns necessitates a robust understanding of cognitive security principles and practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current state of knowledge in negotiation highlights the importance of collaborative approaches and stakeholder engagement. Negotiation research has increasingly focused on the role of trust, communication, and relationship-building in achieving successful outcomes. In cognitive security, existing research emphasizes the need for proactive measures to counter misinformation, including media literacy initiatives and technological solutions. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate negotiation principles into cognitive security practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of negotiation principles into cognitive security presents several research gaps and opportunities. First, there is a need for empirical studies that examine the effectiveness of negotiation strategies in mitigating cognitive threats. Second, the development of practical frameworks that guide stakeholders in implementing collaborative approaches is essential. Finally, the exploration of cultural differences in negotiation practices offers a rich area for future research, particularly in the context of global cognitive security challenges.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The theoretical foundation for this research draws from key negotiation theories, including integrative negotiation and interest-based bargaining.

In cognitive security, theories of threat perception and cognitive biases provide insights into how individuals process information and respond to cognitive threats. Understanding these foundational theories is critical for developing an integrated framework that bridges the two domains.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of negotiation and cognitive security gives rise to new theoretical constructs, such as Cognitive Negotiation and Information Exchange Agreements. Cognitive Negotiation refers to the application of negotiation strategies to enhance cognitive security practices, focusing on collaboration and information sharing among stakeholders. Information Exchange Agreements formalize the processes through which stakeholders share information, fostering trust and cooperation in addressing cognitive threats.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between negotiation strategies and cognitive security practices. At its core, the model emphasizes the importance of stakeholder engagement, information exchange, and cultural sensitivity. By situating negotiation within the context of cognitive security, this model provides a framework for understanding how collaborative approaches can enhance resilience against cognitive threats.
