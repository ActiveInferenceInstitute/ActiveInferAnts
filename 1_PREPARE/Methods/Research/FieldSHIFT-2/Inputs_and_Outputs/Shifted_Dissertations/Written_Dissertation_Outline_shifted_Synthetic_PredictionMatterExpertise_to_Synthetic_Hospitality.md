## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The origins of PME can be traced back to various disciplines, including data science, psychology, and business analytics. These fields emphasize predictive modeling and decision-making, employing statistical techniques to forecast future trends based on historical data. Conversely, the concept of guest experience in hospitality has evolved from a focus on basic service delivery to a complex interplay of personalization, technology, and sustainability.

Historically, hospitality management has prioritized qualitative measures of guest satisfaction, such as service quality and emotional connection. However, the shift toward data-driven approaches has prompted a reevaluation of these traditional metrics, leading to the emergence of new paradigms in guest experience management.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While PME has established methodologies for prediction and analysis, the hospitality sector has predominantly focused on qualitative measures of guest satisfaction. Recent trends indicate a growing interest in utilizing data-driven approaches, yet comprehensive frameworks that integrate these insights remain scarce. 

The current literature highlights the potential of predictive analytics to enhance operational efficiency and guest satisfaction. However, there is a lack of empirical studies that examine the practical applications of these methodologies in hospitality settings. This gap underscores the need for research that bridges the divide between predictive analytics and guest experience management.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of PME and guest experience reveals significant gaps in understanding how predictive analytics can enhance hospitality services. Opportunities lie in developing frameworks that integrate data analysis with service design, ultimately leading to innovative solutions for guest engagement. 

Moreover, the application of predictive analytics can facilitate a more nuanced understanding of guest behavior, preferences, and expectations, allowing hospitality organizations to tailor their offerings accordingly. This research aims to address these gaps by providing a comprehensive analysis of the integration of PME into guest experience management.
