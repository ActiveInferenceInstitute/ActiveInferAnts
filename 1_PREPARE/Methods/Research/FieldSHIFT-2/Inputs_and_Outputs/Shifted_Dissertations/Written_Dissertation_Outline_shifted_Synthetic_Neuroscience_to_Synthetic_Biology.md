## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Neuroscience and ecology, traditionally viewed as distinct fields, share fundamental principles regarding network dynamics, adaptability, and communication. Neuroscience has long been concerned with understanding the intricacies of neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and the mechanisms of information processing in the brain. On the other hand, ecology has focused on the interactions between organisms and their environment, emphasizing the complex relationships that sustain ecosystems. This dissertation examines how concepts from neuroscience can be transposed into ecology to enhance our understanding of ecological systems, suggesting that ecological interactions can be modeled similarly to neural processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two fields that have rarely intersected, offering new perspectives on ecological resilience and adaptability. The novelty lies in the introduction of concepts such as "ecological plasticity" and "trophic oscillations," which provide fresh insights into species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. By framing ecological systems as networks akin to neural networks, this research aims to uncover underlying patterns and principles that govern ecological interactions, thereby enriching both ecological theory and practice.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of neural networks inform our understanding of ecological networks?
2. In what ways do concepts of synaptic plasticity and ecological resilience overlap?
3. What are the implications of viewing ecological interactions through the lens of neurotransmission?

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes several new theoretical constructs that emerge from the integration of neuroscience and ecology:
- **Ecological Plasticity**: A concept analogous to synaptic plasticity, suggesting that species can adapt their roles within ecosystems based on environmental feedback.
- **Ecological Neurotransmitters**: The idea that chemical signals in ecosystems function similarly to neurotransmitters in neural networks, facilitating communication and interaction among species.
- **Trophic Oscillations**: A framework positing that species populations exhibit rhythmic dynamics akin to neural oscillations, influencing energy flow and nutrient cycling.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the parallels between neural networks and ecological networks. It emphasizes the flow of information and energy, highlighting how changes in one part of the network can affect the entire system. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the dynamics of ecological interactions and the implications for ecosystem resilience and adaptability.
