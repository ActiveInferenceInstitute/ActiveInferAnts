## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of the Spatial Web can be traced back to the development of the internet and advancements in digital technologies. Early concepts of virtual reality emerged in the 1960s, but it was not until the 21st century that AR and VR began to gain traction. Concurrently, the field of ecology has a rich history, from the foundational theories of Charles Darwin to contemporary studies on ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Understanding the historical context of both domains is essential for identifying the intersections that can inform future research.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent advancements in AR/VR, IoT, and digital twin technologies have revolutionized data collection and analysis in ecological research. These technologies enable researchers to create immersive environments that simulate ecological interactions, allowing for more comprehensive studies of biodiversity. However, current ecological research methodologies often lack the integration of these digital tools, leading to limitations in data representation and public engagement. This section will analyze these advancements and their implications for ecological research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the potential of digital technologies, significant gaps remain in their application within ecological research. Many studies still rely on traditional methodologies that do not fully exploit the capabilities of the Spatial Web. This section will identify specific gaps, such as the need for real-time monitoring and interactive data visualization, and discuss opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration that can drive innovation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Theoretical foundations from the Spatial Web include concepts of interactivity, data integration, and immersive experiences. These principles can be applied to ecological studies to enhance understanding of species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, ecological theories such as the resilience theory and the adaptive cycle provide insights into how ecosystems respond to disturbances and change over time.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation proposes new theoretical constructs, including the Ecosystem Interactivity Theory, which emphasizes the dynamic relationships between species and their environments, and the Digital Twin Ecosystem Model, which utilizes digital twins to simulate and analyze ecosystem processes. Furthermore, Location-Based Conservation Strategies will be explored, highlighting the role of geospatial technologies in biodiversity management.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integration of concepts from both domains will culminate in a comprehensive model that synthesizes the principles of the Spatial Web with ecological theories. This model will serve as a framework for guiding future research and applications in ecological management, emphasizing the importance of interactivity, real-time data, and immersive experiences.
