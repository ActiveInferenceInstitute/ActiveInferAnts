## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The culinary arts and fabric design have traditionally existed as separate disciplines, each with its own set of principles, techniques, and cultural significance. The culinary arts encompass a rich tapestry of flavors, textures, and traditions, while textile design is grounded in the manipulation of fibers, patterns, and cultural narratives. However, recent trends towards sustainability and personalization in both fields have prompted a reevaluation of their boundaries. The Shifted Domain proposes a systematic transposition of culinary principles into the fabric industry, creating a novel framework for design and production that emphasizes the sensory and experiential aspects of textiles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize textile design by integrating sensory experiences derived from culinary practices. By leveraging concepts such as flavor profiles, cooking methods, and the aesthetics of food presentation, this approach enhances the aesthetic and tactile qualities of fabrics while promoting sustainable practices and cultural diversity. The novelty of this research is underscored by its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between culinary arts and textile design, which has historically been overlooked in academic discourse.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by the following research questions:
- How can culinary principles be systematically transposed into textile design?
- What are the implications of this transposition for creativity, sustainability, and cultural expression in the fabric industry?
- What new theoretical constructs and frameworks can be developed to support this interdisciplinary approach?

The objectives of this research include the identification and analysis of culinary principles applicable to textile design, the exploration of innovative practices that emerge from this transposition, and the establishment of a theoretical framework that supports ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Evolution of Culinary Arts and Textile Design

The culinary arts have evolved from ancient practices of foraging and cooking over open flames to a sophisticated field characterized by diverse techniques and cultural influences. Similarly, textile design has transitioned from rudimentary weaving and dyeing techniques to a complex interplay of technology, artistry, and cultural heritage. Both domains reflect the societies from which they emerge, serving as a mirror of cultural values, economic conditions, and technological advancements.

#### Historical Interconnections Between Food and Fabric in Various Cultures

Throughout history, food and textiles have shared a symbiotic relationship. In many cultures, the preparation and presentation of food are closely tied to the fabrics used in dining experiences. For example, the use of elaborate table linens in European dining traditions reflects not only aesthetic values but also social status. In contrast, the vibrant textiles of African and Asian cultures often incorporate motifs and colors that represent local culinary practices. This historical context underscores the potential for a deeper exploration of the connections between these two domains.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Contemporary Practices in Culinary Arts and Textile Design

In contemporary practice, the culinary arts have embraced innovation through molecular gastronomy, fusion cuisine, and sustainable sourcing, while textile design has seen advancements in sustainable materials, digital printing, and smart textiles. Both fields are increasingly focused on experiential consumption, where the sensory qualities of food and fabric are paramount. However, the existing body of literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of how these practices can be integrated to foster new forms of creativity and expression.

#### Review of Sustainability Efforts and Technological Advancements in Each Domain

Sustainability has become a critical concern in both culinary and textile industries. The farm-to-table movement in culinary arts emphasizes local sourcing and ecological responsibility, while the textile industry is increasingly adopting practices such as recycling, biodegradable materials, and ethical labor practices. Technological advancements, including digital fabrication and innovative dyeing techniques, present opportunities for reducing waste and enhancing the sustainability of both fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in Current Research

Despite the growing interest in sustainability and sensory experiences within both fields, there remains a significant gap in research that examines the intersection of culinary principles and textile design. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by providing a structured framework that facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation Through Interdisciplinary Collaboration

The Shifted Domain presents a unique opportunity for innovation by encouraging collaboration between culinary artists, textile designers, and sustainability experts. By fostering dialogue and experimentation across disciplines, this research aims to unlock new avenues for creativity and cultural expression, ultimately benefiting both industries.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theories Related to Flavor Profiles, Cooking Methods, and Sensory Experiences

Culinary theories emphasize the importance of flavor profiles, which are shaped by the interplay of ingredients, cooking methods, and cultural contexts. The concept of umami, for instance, illustrates how certain flavors can evoke emotional responses and memories. Understanding these theories provides a foundation for exploring how similar principles can be applied to textile design.

#### Textile Theories Concerning Fabric Construction, Design Principles, and Cultural Significance

Textile theories encompass a range of concepts related to fabric construction, such as weaving techniques, dyeing processes, and pattern design. These theories also highlight the cultural significance of textiles, illustrating how fabrics can convey identity, heritage, and social values. By integrating these theories with culinary principles, a more holistic understanding of design can be achieved.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of Concepts Such as "Textile Gastronomy" and "Flavor Pairing in Textiles"

This research proposes the development of new theoretical constructs, such as "Textile Gastronomy," which examines the sensory experiences of fabrics in relation to culinary practices. Additionally, the concept of "Flavor Pairing in Textiles" explores how the principles of flavor pairing can inform color and texture combinations in fabric design, creating a cohesive sensory experience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model connects culinary principles with textile design processes, illustrating how concepts such as flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and sensory experiences can inform and enhance textile design. This model serves as a foundation for further exploration and experimentation within the Shifted Domain.
