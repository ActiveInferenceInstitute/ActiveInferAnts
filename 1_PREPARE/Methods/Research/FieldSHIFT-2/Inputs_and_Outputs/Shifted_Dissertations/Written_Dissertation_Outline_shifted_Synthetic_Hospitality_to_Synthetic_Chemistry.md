## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and the mechanistic understanding of chemical reactions. By transposing concepts such as personalization, service quality, technology integration, and sustainability, this research will develop novel frameworks and methodologies that enhance chemical processes. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it offers a fresh perspective on chemical efficiency and sustainability, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and opening new avenues for education and practice.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalized service and emotional engagement. The evolution of guest experience, which encompasses various dimensions such as service quality, emotional satisfaction, and personalization, has become a critical differentiator in a highly competitive market. Conversely, chemical reactions are traditionally viewed through the lens of mechanistic processes and efficiency, often devoid of human-centric considerations. This dissertation seeks to merge these domains, proposing that the principles of guest experience can inform and enhance chemical practices, thereby creating a more holistic approach to chemical processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective to chemical reactions, emphasizing the human element and sustainability. By adopting a guest-centric approach, chemists can optimize reaction conditions and outcomes, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. The implications extend beyond mere efficiency; they encompass a broader understanding of how human factors can influence scientific practices, thereby fostering a culture of innovation and responsiveness in chemical research and industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- **How can principles of guest experience be applied to optimize chemical reactions?**
- **What new metrics can be developed to assess the "reaction experience"?**
- **How can technology enhance both guest experiences and chemical processes?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of guest experience within the hospitality industry has been marked by a gradual shift from basic service provision to a more nuanced understanding of customer needs and preferences. Pioneering works by authors like Pine and Gilmore (1999) introduced the concept of the "experience economy," which emphasizes the importance of creating memorable experiences for guests. In contrast, the development of chemical reaction theories has been dominated by quantitative analyses of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, with foundational contributions from scientists such as Arrhenius and Van 't Hoff. This historical context sets the stage for a potential integration of these two fields.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current methodologies in guest experience management include frameworks like SERVQUAL, which measures service quality across dimensions such as reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and responsiveness. In the realm of chemical reactions, research has advanced towards understanding reaction mechanisms, catalysis, and the development of sustainable practices. Notable advancements include the emergence of green chemistry principles, which advocate for the reduction of hazardous substances in chemical processes. However, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the intersection of these two domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The lack of interdisciplinary research connecting hospitality principles with chemical processes presents a unique opportunity for innovation. By exploring how guest experience can inform reaction design, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and propose new methodologies that enhance both efficiency and sustainability in chemical practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Theories of Service Quality (SERVQUAL) in Hospitality:** SERVQUAL provides a framework for assessing service quality by evaluating the gap between customer expectations and perceptions. This model can be adapted to measure the "quality" of chemical reactions, focusing on aspects such as yield, selectivity, and sustainability.
  
- **Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Chemical Reactions:** The principles of kinetics and thermodynamics govern the behavior of chemical reactions. Understanding these foundational theories will allow for a more nuanced application of guest experience principles to optimize reaction conditions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Guest-Centric Reaction Design Model:** This model proposes that reaction conditions can be tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the "guest" (i.e., the reactants and products involved). It emphasizes personalization in reaction design, drawing parallels with the hospitality industry's focus on individualized service.

- **Service Quality in Chemistry Model:** This construct extends the SERVQUAL framework to chemical processes, proposing metrics that assess reaction quality based on service quality dimensions. This model aims to create a more holistic understanding of reaction efficiency.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The comprehensive model bridges guest experience and chemical reactions, emphasizing personalization, quality metrics, and sustainability. It posits that by viewing chemical reactions through a guest-centric lens, chemists can enhance both the efficiency and satisfaction associated with chemical processes.

## Methodology
