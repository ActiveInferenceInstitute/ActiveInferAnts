By transposing concepts such as personalization, service quality, technology integration, and sustainability, this research will develop novel frameworks and methodologies that enhance chemical processes. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it offers a fresh perspective on chemical efficiency and sustainability, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and opening new avenues for education and practice.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalized service and emotional engagement. This sector has evolved from a purely transactional model to one that emphasizes the holistic experience of the guest, integrating elements such as ambiance, service quality, and emotional connection. Conversely, chemical reactions are traditionally viewed through the lens of mechanistic processes and efficiency, often characterized by rigid protocols and quantitative metrics. This dissertation seeks to merge these domains, proposing that the principles of guest experience can inform and enhance chemical practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective to chemical reactions, emphasizing the human element and sustainability. By adopting a guest-centric approach, chemists can optimize reaction conditions and outcomes, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes. The implications of this approach extend beyond the laboratory, potentially influencing educational curricula, industrial practices, and policy frameworks related to chemical production and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation will explore the following research questions:

- How can principles of guest experience be applied to optimize chemical reactions?
- What new metrics can be developed to assess the "reaction experience"?
- How can technology enhance both guest experiences and chemical processes?

The objectives of this research include developing a comprehensive framework that integrates guest experience principles into the design and execution of chemical reactions, identifying new metrics for assessing reaction quality, and exploring the role of technology in enhancing both domains.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of guest experience in hospitality can be traced back to the early 20th century, when service quality began to gain prominence as a key differentiator in the industry. Pioneering figures such as CÃ©sar Ritz emphasized the importance of personalized service, leading to the establishment of hotel management principles that prioritize guest satisfaction. In contrast, the development of chemical reaction theories has a rich history rooted in classical mechanics and thermodynamics. Key milestones include the formulation of the Arrhenius equation and the establishment of catalysis principles, which have shaped our understanding of reaction kinetics and efficiency.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current methodologies in guest experience management emphasize the importance of service quality dimensions, such as reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and tangibles. The SERVQUAL model serves as a foundational framework for assessing service quality in hospitality. In the realm of chemical kinetics and catalysis, cutting-edge research focuses on optimizing reaction conditions through advanced techniques such as high-throughput screening and machine learning algorithms. Despite the advancements in both fields, a gap exists in interdisciplinary research that connects the principles of guest experience with chemical processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research connecting hospitality principles with chemical processes presents an opportunity for innovation. By exploring the intersection of these domains, this dissertation aims to develop new frameworks for reaction design that prioritize personalization and quality metrics, ultimately enhancing sustainability practices in the chemical industry.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Two foundational theories underpin this research: the SERVQUAL model from hospitality and the principles of kinetics and thermodynamics from chemistry. The SERVQUAL model provides a structured approach to measuring service quality, while the principles of chemical kinetics offer insights into the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions. These theories serve as the basis for developing new constructs that bridge the two domains.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes two new theoretical constructs:

1. **Guest-Centric Reaction Design Model**: This model emphasizes the importance of tailoring reaction conditions to meet the specific needs of the "guest," or reactants, thereby enhancing yield and selectivity.

2. **Service Quality in Chemistry Model**: This model integrates service quality dimensions into the assessment of chemical reactions, proposing that reaction efficiency can be evaluated through metrics traditionally used in hospitality.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model bridges guest experience and chemical reactions, emphasizing personalization, quality metrics, and sustainability. This model serves as a foundation for the subsequent research and experimental design, guiding the exploration of how guest-centric principles can be applied to optimize chemical processes.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed in this research, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the transposition of principles. This approach allows for a comprehensive examination of both theoretical constructs and practical applications, providing a holistic understanding of the intersection between guest experience and chemical reactions.

### Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through various methods, including:

- **Surveys and Interviews**: Surveys will be distributed to hospitality professionals and chemists to gather insights on the application of guest experience principles in chemical processes. In-depth interviews will also be conducted to explore the experiences and perspectives of industry experts.
  
- **Case Studies**: Selected case studies of successful applications of guest experience principles in chemical processes will be analyzed to identify best practices and innovative approaches.

### Analytical Approaches

Data analysis will involve both statistical and thematic approaches:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative data from surveys will be analyzed using statistical software to identify correlations between guest experience principles and reaction efficiency.

- **Thematic Analysis**: Qualitative data from interviews will be subjected to thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and insights related to the integration of guest experience and chemical processes.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and confidentiality will be maintained, particularly in case studies involving proprietary processes. Ethical guidelines will be adhered to in order to ensure the integrity of the research.
