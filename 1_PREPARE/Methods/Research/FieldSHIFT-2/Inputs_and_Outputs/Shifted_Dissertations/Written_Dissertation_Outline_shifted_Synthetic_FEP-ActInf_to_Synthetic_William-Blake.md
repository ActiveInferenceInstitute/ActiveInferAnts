# PhD Dissertation: Bridging the Free Energy Principle and William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the life and work of William Blake. By analyzing how Blake's artistic and poetic expressions can be understood through the lens of FEP, this research seeks to uncover new dimensions of his legacy while contributing to a deeper understanding of creativity, cognition, and human experience. The potential impact of this research extends beyond literary studies, promising insights into cognitive science, psychology, and the philosophy of art, thereby fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems act to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through predictive coding and active inference. This principle, rooted in the fields of neuroscience and cognitive science, suggests that organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world to reduce discrepancies between their predictions and sensory inputs. In contrast, William Blake's work encapsulates a profound exploration of dualities and human experience, intertwining themes of innocence and experience, the material and the spiritual, and the rational and the imaginative. This dissertation investigates the potential of integrating these two domains, offering a novel perspective on both FEP and Blake's contributions to art and literature.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges cognitive science and the humanities, presenting a unique framework for understanding artistic creativity and human experience. By applying FEP to Blake's work, the dissertation aims to reveal how artistic expression can function as a mechanism for minimizing variational free energy, providing a fresh lens through which to view both cognitive processes and artistic endeavors. The interdisciplinary nature of this research not only enhances the understanding of Blake's work but also contributes to the broader discourse on creativity, cognition, and the role of art in society.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to analyze William Blake’s artistic and poetic works?
2. In what ways do Blake's themes of duality and complexity reflect the cognitive processes described by FEP?
3. What new insights can this interdisciplinary approach offer for understanding creativity and the role of the artist in society?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Development of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, evolving through contributions from various fields including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. The principle, primarily articulated by Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize their free energy—essentially the difference between predicted sensory inputs and actual sensory inputs. This minimization process is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and adaptive behavior in a constantly changing environment. Key concepts within this framework include predictive coding, which suggests that the brain operates as a predictive machine, and active inference, which posits that organisms act to fulfill their predictions.

#### William Blake’s Historical Context

William Blake (1757-1827) was a visionary poet, painter, and printmaker whose work challenged the artistic conventions of his time. Living during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Blake's life was marked by the tumult of the Industrial Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic movement. His artistic practices were deeply intertwined with his philosophical beliefs, particularly regarding the nature of imagination, the dichotomy of experience and innocence, and the role of the artist as a prophet. Blake’s oeuvre reflects a rich tapestry of symbolic imagery and complex themes, making him a pivotal figure in both literary and artistic history.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Key Findings in Cognitive Science Related to FEP

Recent advancements in cognitive science have illuminated the mechanisms underlying the Free Energy Principle. Research in predictive coding has demonstrated that the brain continuously generates and updates internal models of the world, allowing individuals to navigate their environment effectively. This has implications for understanding perception, decision-making, and even mental health. Furthermore, studies in active inference emphasize the importance of agency and action in the process of minimizing surprise, suggesting that individuals actively shape their experiences through their interactions with the world.

#### Existing Scholarship on Blake

The scholarship on William Blake has expanded significantly, encompassing various interpretations of his poetry and art. Scholars have explored his engagement with themes such as duality, spirituality, and the critique of societal norms. However, much of the existing literature tends to compartmentalize Blake's work within literary studies, often neglecting the cognitive and psychological dimensions of his artistic expression. This presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich theoretical frameworks established in both cognitive science and literary studies, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these fields. The integration of FEP with Blake's work offers a promising avenue for developing new theoretical frameworks that can enhance both cognitive science and the humanities. By bridging these domains, this research aims to foster a deeper understanding of creativity, artistic expression, and human cognition.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Concepts from the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several foundational concepts, including:

- **Variational Free Energy**: A measure of the difference between the predicted and actual sensory inputs, representing the "surprise" experienced by an organism.
- **Predictive Coding**: The framework suggesting that the brain generates predictions about incoming sensory information and updates these predictions based on discrepancies between expected and actual inputs.
- **Markov Blankets**: A conceptual boundary that separates an organism from its environment, allowing for the distinction between internal states and external stimuli.

#### Blake's Philosophical Beliefs

William Blake's philosophy is characterized by a profound belief in the power of imagination as a creative force. He viewed the imagination as a means of transcending the limitations of the material world, allowing individuals to perceive deeper truths. Blake's exploration of dualities—such as innocence and experience—reflects his understanding of the complexities of human existence and the interplay between opposing forces.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### The Blakean Free Energy Model

This dissertation proposes the Blakean Free Energy Model, positing that Blake's works can be understood as a form of variational free energy minimization. In this model, Blake's artistic and poetic expressions serve as mechanisms for navigating the complexities of human experience, allowing both the creator and the audience to engage in a process of reducing surprise and enhancing understanding.

#### Predictive Artistic Coding Framework

The Predictive Artistic Coding framework explains how audiences engage with Blake's art through the lens of predictive coding. This framework posits that viewers actively construct their interpretations of Blake's works, continuously updating their internal models based on their sensory experiences and emotional responses.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model synthesizes the principles of the Free Energy Principle with Blake's artistic philosophy, illustrating the dynamic interplay between cognitive processes and creative expression. This model positions artistic engagement as a reciprocal process, where both the artist and the audience participate in the minimization of variational free energy through their interactions with the artwork.
