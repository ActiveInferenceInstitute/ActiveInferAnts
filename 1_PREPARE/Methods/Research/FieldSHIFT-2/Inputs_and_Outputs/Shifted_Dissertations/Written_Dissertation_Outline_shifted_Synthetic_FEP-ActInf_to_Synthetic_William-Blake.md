# PhD Dissertation: Bridging the Free Energy Principle and William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the life and work of William Blake. By analyzing how Blake's artistic and poetic expressions can be understood through the lens of FEP, this research seeks to uncover new dimensions of his legacy while contributing to a deeper understanding of creativity, cognition, and human experience. The potential impact of this research extends beyond literary studies, promising insights into cognitive science, psychology, and the philosophy of art, thereby fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems act to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through predictive coding and active inference. This framework, rooted in statistical mechanics and information theory, suggests that organisms continuously generate and update predictions about their environment to reduce the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory inputs. In contrast, William Blake's work encapsulates a profound exploration of dualities and human experience, reflecting his engagement with themes of perception, imagination, and the nature of reality. This dissertation investigates the potential for integrating these two domains, offering a novel perspective on both FEP and Blake's contributions to art and literature.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges cognitive science and the humanities, presenting a unique framework for understanding artistic creativity and human experience. By applying FEP to Blake's work, the dissertation aims to reveal how artistic expression can function as a mechanism for minimizing variational free energy, providing a fresh lens through which to view both cognitive processes and artistic endeavors. Furthermore, this interdisciplinary approach promises to enrich our understanding of the cognitive underpinnings of creativity and the role of the artist in society, thereby fostering a dialogue between scientific inquiry and artistic expression.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to analyze William Blake’s artistic and poetic works?
- In what ways do Blake's themes of duality and complexity reflect the cognitive processes described by FEP?
- What new insights can this interdisciplinary approach offer for understanding creativity and the role of the artist in society?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle in Cognitive Science

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Karl Friston, has emerged as a pivotal concept in cognitive science, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding the behavior of living systems. It posits that organisms strive to minimize variational free energy, a measure of surprise or uncertainty in their environment. Central to this principle are concepts such as predictive coding, which suggests that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input, and active inference, which posits that organisms act to fulfill these predictions. This section will explore the historical development of FEP, its theoretical implications, and its relevance to understanding cognition and behavior.

#### William Blake's Historical Context

William Blake (1757-1827) was a seminal figure in the Romantic period, known for his visionary poetry and innovative visual art. His work reflects a profound engagement with the complexities of human experience, exploring themes of duality, spirituality, and the interplay between imagination and reality. This section will provide an overview of Blake's life, including his artistic practices and philosophical beliefs, situating his contributions within the broader context of the Romantic movement and the socio-political landscape of his time.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cognitive Science and the Free Energy Principle

Recent advancements in cognitive science have expanded our understanding of the Free Energy Principle, highlighting its implications for perception, action, and decision-making. Key findings include the role of predictive coding in shaping sensory experiences and the importance of active inference in adaptive behavior. This section will summarize the current state of knowledge regarding FEP, emphasizing its relevance to understanding the cognitive processes underlying creativity and artistic expression.

#### Scholarship on William Blake

Existing scholarship on William Blake has primarily focused on his thematic explorations, artistic innovations, and philosophical underpinnings. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting cognitive science and the humanities. This section will analyze the current state of scholarship on Blake, highlighting key themes and debates while identifying opportunities for further exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich theoretical frameworks available in both cognitive science and literary studies, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these domains. This section will identify the limitations of current scholarship and explore the potential for new theoretical frameworks that can enhance both fields, ultimately paving the way for a deeper understanding of creativity, cognition, and artistic expression.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle Concepts

This section will provide an overview of key concepts from the Free Energy Principle, including variational free energy, predictive coding, and Markov blankets. Variational free energy serves as a measure of the difference between predicted and actual sensory inputs, while predictive coding posits that the brain encodes information by minimizing this difference. Markov blankets delineate the boundaries between an organism and its environment, allowing for the exchange of information necessary for minimizing surprise.

#### Blake's Philosophical Beliefs

William Blake's philosophical beliefs regarding imagination, experience, and the role of the artist will be examined in this section. Blake viewed imagination as a transformative force, capable of transcending the limitations of rational thought and revealing deeper truths about existence. His emphasis on the dualities of experience—such as heaven and hell, innocence and experience—reflects a profound understanding of the complexities of human cognition and creativity.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### The Blakean Free Energy Model

This section will introduce the Blakean Free Energy Model, positing that Blake's works can be understood as a form of variational free energy minimization. By analyzing his artistic and poetic expressions through the lens of FEP, this model suggests that Blake's creations serve as mechanisms for navigating the complexities of human experience and minimizing cognitive dissonance.

#### Predictive Artistic Coding Framework

The Predictive Artistic Coding framework will be developed in this section, explaining how audiences engage with Blake's art through the principles of predictive coding and active inference. This framework posits that viewers and readers actively construct meaning from Blake's works by generating predictions based on their prior experiences and knowledge, thereby engaging in a dynamic process of interpretation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A comprehensive model that synthesizes FEP and Blake's artistic principles will be presented in this section, illustrating the dynamic interplay between cognitive processes and creative expression. This integrated theoretical model will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analysis of Blake's works and their implications for understanding creativity and cognition.
