## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Negotiation

Negotiation has a rich history, with key theories emerging from various disciplines. Notable frameworks include Fisher and Ury's principled negotiation, which emphasizes mutual gains, and the dual concern model, which highlights the balance between concern for self and concern for others. Interpersonal dynamics, communication skills, and cultural sensitivity are critical components of successful negotiation practices. The evolution of negotiation theory has underscored the importance of understanding the psychological and social dimensions of negotiation.

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has revolutionized our understanding of the brain and its functions. Foundational concepts such as neural networks, neurotransmitters, and decision-making processes provide a biological basis for behavior. Research in this field has elucidated how brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, are involved in complex cognitive tasks, including decision-making and emotional regulation. The integration of neuroscience into psychological research has opened new avenues for understanding human behavior.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in negotiation research have focused on the role of emotions, cognitive biases, and social dynamics in negotiation outcomes. Simultaneously, neuroscience has made significant strides in mapping brain activity associated with decision-making and emotional processing. However, interdisciplinary research that bridges negotiation and neuroscience remains limited. This gap presents a unique opportunity to explore the neural underpinnings of negotiation, offering insights that could enhance both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich literature in both negotiation and neuroscience, there are notable gaps in understanding how these fields intersect. Existing research often treats negotiation as a purely psychological phenomenon, neglecting the underlying neural mechanisms that drive behavior. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by investigating the neural correlates of negotiation strategies, emotional states, and cultural influences. The opportunities for new research directions are vast, with the potential to develop interdisciplinary methodologies and theoretical advancements that could significantly impact both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Negotiation Theory

Key concepts in negotiation theory include the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA), integrative versus distributive negotiation, and emotional intelligence. BATNA emphasizes the importance of knowing one's alternatives to strengthen negotiation positions. Integrative negotiation focuses on collaborative strategies that create value for all parties, while distributive negotiation involves competitive tactics aimed at maximizing individual gain. Emotional intelligence, encompassing self-awareness and empathy, plays a crucial role in navigating interpersonal dynamics during negotiations.

#### Neuroscience Theory

Neuroscience theories provide a framework for understanding the brain's role in behavior. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, is fundamental to learning and memory. Neural circuits, composed of interconnected neurons, facilitate communication within the brain, influencing decision-making processes. Neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, modulate emotional responses and cognitive functions, impacting negotiation outcomes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The concept of "Neural Negotiation" emerges as a theoretical construct that parallels negotiation dynamics with synaptic interactions. This framework posits that negotiation processes can be understood through the lens of neural mechanisms, where strategies and outcomes are influenced by underlying brain activity. By drawing connections between negotiation strategies and neural processing mechanisms, this research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how these domains interact.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model presented in this dissertation illustrates the relationship between negotiation processes and neural activity. Key constructs, such as emotional regulation, cognitive load, and cultural influences, are depicted as interconnected elements that shape negotiation outcomes. This model serves as a foundation for empirical research, guiding the exploration of how neural mechanisms inform negotiation strategies and vice versa.
