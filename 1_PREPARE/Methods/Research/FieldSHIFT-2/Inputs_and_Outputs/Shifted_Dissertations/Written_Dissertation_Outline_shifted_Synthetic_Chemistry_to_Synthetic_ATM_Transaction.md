## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemical Reactions

The study of chemical reactions has evolved significantly since the early days of chemistry. Fundamental principles such as the conservation of mass, reaction kinetics, and catalysis have shaped our understanding of how reactants transform into products. Historical milestones include the formulation of the kinetic molecular theory and the development of the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of reaction rates.

#### ATM Transactions

The evolution of ATM technology began in the late 1960s, with the introduction of the first cash dispensers. Over the decades, ATMs have undergone substantial technological advancements, including the integration of card readers, touch screens, and online banking functionalities. Despite these advancements, key challenges persist in user experience and security, particularly in the face of increasing cyber threats.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemical Reactions

Recent advancements in catalysis, particularly in the fields of green chemistry and nanotechnology, have led to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes. Current research trends focus on the development of new catalysts that can operate under milder conditions, improving reaction rates and selectivity.

#### ATM Transactions

Contemporary ATM technologies incorporate advanced user experience design principles and enhanced security measures, such as biometric authentication and encryption protocols. However, challenges remain regarding the interoperability of ATM systems and the need for seamless user experiences across different platforms.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research exploring the intersection of chemistry and financial technology. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation in user interface design and transaction optimization by leveraging chemical principles to enhance ATM functionalities.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
