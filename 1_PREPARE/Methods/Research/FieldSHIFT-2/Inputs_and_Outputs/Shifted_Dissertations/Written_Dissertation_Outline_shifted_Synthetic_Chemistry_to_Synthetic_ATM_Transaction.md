## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemistry

To appreciate the intersection of chemistry and ATM transactions, it is essential to trace the evolution of chemistry from its origins in alchemy to modern chemical theory. Key milestones include the formulation of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev in the 19th century, which organized elements based on their atomic structure and properties, and the development of atomic theory, which laid the groundwork for understanding chemical reactions as interactions between atoms and molecules. The understanding of reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and molecular interactions has evolved significantly, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing complex systems.

#### ATM Transactions

The history of ATMs dates back to the 1960s, with the first machine installed in London by Barclays Bank. Initially designed to dispense cash, ATMs have evolved into sophisticated financial tools offering a range of services, including deposits, transfers, and account management. The integration of technology into banking has transformed user experiences, with a focus on security, accessibility, and efficiency. However, despite technological advancements, challenges remain in optimizing user interactions and streamlining transaction processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in chemistry focuses on understanding reaction mechanisms and kinetics, exploring how different factors influence reaction rates and outcomes. In the realm of ATM technology, contemporary studies emphasize the importance of user experience design, transaction flow optimization, and security protocols. Although both fields have made significant strides, the lack of interdisciplinary approaches presents an opportunity to leverage chemical principles for innovative solutions in banking.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary approaches in existing literature highlights the potential to explore new methodologies that combine insights from chemistry with practical applications in banking. By treating ATM transactions as chemical reactions, we can uncover unique patterns and relationships that may lead to enhanced user experiences and operational efficiencies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Chemistry

The foundational theories of chemistry relevant to this study include reaction kinetics, which examines the rates of chemical reactions; thermodynamics, which explores the energy changes associated with reactions; and molecular interactions, which focus on how molecules interact to produce observable outcomes. These theories provide a robust framework for analyzing the complexities of ATM transactions, where user inputs and system responses can be viewed as analogous to reactants and products.

#### ATM Transactions

In the context of ATM transactions, foundational theories include user experience design, which emphasizes the importance of intuitive interfaces and user-friendly interactions; transaction flow, which examines the sequence of steps involved in completing a transaction; and security protocols, which ensure the safety and integrity of financial transactions. Understanding these theories is crucial for developing an integrated approach that leverages chemical principles to optimize ATM interactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

Emerging from this interdisciplinary exploration are new theoretical constructs such as "transaction catalysts" and "ATM reaction mechanisms." Transaction catalysts refer to design elements or features that enhance user interactions and expedite transaction processes, while ATM reaction mechanisms describe the sequence of events that occur during a transaction, akin to the steps in a chemical reaction. These constructs provide a framework for analyzing and improving ATM transactions through the lens of chemistry.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the parallels between chemical reactions and ATM transactions. It emphasizes the role of catalysts (user interface enhancements) in facilitating reactions (transactions) and achieving equilibrium (optimal user experience). This model serves as a foundation for analyzing ATM interactions and developing strategies for improvement.
