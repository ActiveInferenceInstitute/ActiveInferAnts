## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Negotiation has traditionally been confined to interpersonal and organizational contexts, often characterized by face-to-face interactions and established frameworks that prioritize dialogue and compromise. However, the emergence of the Spatial Web—integrating augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT)—is redefining user interactions and negotiation dynamics. The Spatial Web creates immersive environments that allow for a reimagining of how individuals and organizations negotiate, presenting unique challenges and opportunities. 

As users engage in virtual spaces, the nature of negotiation shifts from a predominantly verbal and linear process to one that is spatially distributed and contextually rich. This transformation necessitates a reevaluation of existing negotiation frameworks, compelling researchers and practitioners to explore how spatial data and digital interactions can be harnessed to facilitate more effective negotiation outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the gap between traditional negotiation frameworks and the emerging needs of the Spatial Web. Existing negotiation theories often overlook the complexities introduced by spatial dynamics and digital interactions, which can significantly impact negotiation strategies and outcomes. By proposing a new model of negotiation that incorporates spatial data and digital interactions, this dissertation aims to enhance collaborative decision-making and user engagement in virtual environments.

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, drawing insights from negotiation theory, spatial technologies, and cultural studies. By synthesizing these fields, the dissertation seeks to develop a comprehensive framework for "Spatial Negotiation," which will not only enrich academic discourse but also offer practical applications for various industries.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation is guided by the following overarching research questions:

1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into the Spatial Web?
2. What are the implications of spatial data on negotiation strategies and outcomes?
3. How can cultural and contextual sensitivity improve negotiation practices in virtual spaces?

The objectives of this research include:

- Developing a theoretical framework for Spatial Negotiation that incorporates spatial dynamics and cultural nuances.
- Conducting empirical research to validate the proposed framework and its applications in various contexts.
- Exploring the implications of Spatial Negotiation for industries such as real estate, education, and conflict resolution.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Negotiation

Negotiation is a multifaceted process involving communication, persuasion, and decision-making. Over the years, various theories have emerged to explain negotiation dynamics, including integrative and distributive strategies. Integrative negotiation focuses on collaborative problem-solving, where parties seek mutually beneficial outcomes, while distributive negotiation is characterized by competitive tactics aimed at maximizing individual gains.

Key theorists, such as Fisher and Ury (1981), have emphasized the importance of principled negotiation, which prioritizes interests over positions. This approach advocates for open communication, the exploration of options, and the use of objective criteria to facilitate fair outcomes. However, traditional negotiation frameworks often assume a stable environment and do not account for the complexities introduced by digital and spatial contexts.

#### Spatial Web

The Spatial Web represents a convergence of physical and digital realms, facilitated by advancements in AR, VR, and IoT technologies. These innovations enable immersive experiences that enhance user interactions and engagement. The development of the Spatial Web has implications for various sectors, including education, healthcare, and urban planning, as it allows for novel applications of spatial data and visualization techniques.

The integration of spatial technologies into everyday life raises questions about user experience, data privacy, and ethical considerations. Current research in this area has primarily focused on technological advancements and their applications, often neglecting the implications for negotiation practices and collaborative decision-making.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing body of knowledge on negotiation frameworks reveals several limitations. Traditional models often fail to address the complexities of virtual interactions, such as the impact of spatial dynamics on communication and decision-making. Additionally, there is a lack of empirical research exploring the effectiveness of negotiation strategies in digital environments.

In the realm of spatial technologies, while substantial progress has been made in developing AR and VR applications, their potential for enhancing negotiation processes remains underexplored. Current studies primarily focus on user engagement and experience, with limited attention to the specific negotiation dynamics that arise in these contexts.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of negotiation principles with spatial technologies presents significant opportunities for innovation. There is a clear gap in the literature regarding the development of integrated models that combine negotiation strategies with spatial data and digital interactions. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by proposing a new framework for Spatial Negotiation that emphasizes adaptability, empathy, and cultural sensitivity.

The opportunities for research in this area are vast, particularly in exploring how spatial technologies can enhance user engagement, improve decision-making processes, and foster collaborative environments. By addressing these gaps, this dissertation aims to contribute to the theoretical understanding of negotiation in the context of the Spatial Web while offering practical solutions for various industries.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Negotiation Theory

Negotiation theory provides the foundational concepts for understanding how parties engage in dialogue, manage conflicts, and reach agreements. Key theories include integrative and distributive negotiation strategies, which inform the development of negotiation tactics and approaches. Integrative negotiation emphasizes collaboration and the pursuit of win-win outcomes, while distributive negotiation focuses on competitive strategies aimed at maximizing individual gains.

#### Interaction Theory

Interaction theory explores the dynamics of communication and relationship management in negotiation contexts. It emphasizes the importance of active listening, empathy, and cultural awareness in fostering effective dialogue. As negotiation increasingly occurs in digital and spatial environments, understanding these interaction dynamics becomes crucial for developing effective negotiation strategies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Spatial Negotiation Framework

The Spatial Negotiation Framework is a novel construct that integrates negotiation principles with spatial dynamics and digital interactions. This framework emphasizes the role of spatial data in shaping negotiation strategies and outcomes, highlighting the importance of context and environment in decision-making processes. By incorporating spatial awareness into negotiation practices, this framework aims to enhance collaborative decision-making and user engagement.

#### Contextual Empathy Theory

Contextual Empathy Theory posits that understanding cultural nuances and contextual factors is essential for effective negotiation in virtual spaces. This theory emphasizes the need for negotiators to develop cultural sensitivity and awareness of the spatial context in which negotiations occur. By fostering empathy and understanding, negotiators can navigate complex interactions and achieve more favorable outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model links negotiation principles with spatial data analytics, emphasizing adaptability and empathy as key components of effective negotiation in the Spatial Web. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the implications of spatial technologies on negotiation strategies and outcomes, guiding empirical research and practical applications.
