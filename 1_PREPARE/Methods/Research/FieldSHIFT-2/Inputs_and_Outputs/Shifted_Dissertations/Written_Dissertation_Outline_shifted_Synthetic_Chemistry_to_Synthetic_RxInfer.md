## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of chemistry and probabilistic programming represents a groundbreaking shift that can transform how we model complex systems. Chemistry, with its emphasis on interactions and transformations, aligns seamlessly with probabilistic programming's focus on updating beliefs in uncertain environments. In traditional chemistry, the behavior of molecules is governed by well-defined principles, such as reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, which describe how substances interact and change. Similarly, probabilistic programming allows for the modeling of uncertainty and the refinement of predictions based on new data. This intersection presents an opportunity to develop a more nuanced understanding of inference processes by applying chemical principles to probabilistic frameworks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

By conceptualizing inference processes as chemical reactions, we facilitate a deeper understanding of model dynamics. The novelty lies in the systematic application of chemical concepts, such as reaction rates and equilibrium states, to enhance Bayesian inference methodologies. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also has practical implications for improving the accuracy and interpretability of models used in various domains.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemistry

The evolution of chemistry from alchemy to modern chemistry is marked by significant milestones, including the development of the periodic table and atomic theory. Alchemy, with its mystical and philosophical underpinnings, laid the groundwork for the systematic study of matter. The transition to modern chemistry occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, driven by the work of scientists such as Antoine Lavoisier, who established the law of conservation of mass, and Dmitri Mendeleev, who created the periodic table. These advancements provided a robust framework for understanding chemical reactions and the behavior of substances.

#### RxInfer.jl

RxInfer.jl is a probabilistic programming library designed to facilitate Bayesian inference. The development of probabilistic programming has its roots in the need to model complex systems under uncertainty. Early frameworks, such as BUGS and JAGS, paved the way for more sophisticated libraries like RxInfer.jl, which leverage modern computational capabilities to enhance scalability and efficiency in Bayesian modeling. However, challenges remain in areas such as model interpretability and the development of algorithms that can handle large datasets.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemistry

Recent advances in chemistry, particularly in green chemistry and computational methods, have transformed how chemical processes are approached. Green chemistry emphasizes sustainable practices and the reduction of hazardous substances, while computational chemistry utilizes algorithms and simulations to predict chemical behavior. These advancements have opened new avenues for research and application, particularly in materials science and pharmaceuticals.

#### RxInfer.jl

Current research in RxInfer.jl focuses on addressing challenges related to scalability, model interpretability, and the need for improved algorithms. Despite its capabilities, there remains a gap in the integration of domain-specific knowledge, such as that from chemistry, which could enhance the modeling process. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by proposing the Chemical Inference Models framework.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary approaches that combine chemical principles with probabilistic programming. This research aims to fill this gap by proposing a new framework that enhances both fields. By integrating concepts from chemistry into RxInfer.jl, we can develop models that are not only more accurate but also provide greater insights into the underlying processes governing inference.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Thermodynamics and Kinetics

Thermodynamics and kinetics are foundational principles in chemistry that govern chemical reactions. Thermodynamics focuses on the energy changes associated with chemical processes, while kinetics examines the rates at which reactions occur. These principles can be applied to understand how inference processes converge and how external factors influence model performance.

#### Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference is a statistical method that updates beliefs based on observed data. It is characterized by the use of prior distributions, likelihood functions, and posterior distributions. The ability to incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs in light of new evidence makes Bayesian inference a powerful tool for modeling uncertainty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The emergence of "Chemical Inference Models" (CIM) redefines how we understand inference processes through the lens of chemical dynamics. By conceptualizing inference as a series of chemical reactions, we can draw parallels between the behavior of molecules and the updating of beliefs in probabilistic models. This new theoretical construct provides a framework for exploring the dynamics of inference in a more nuanced manner.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model incorporates reaction dynamics, catalytic influences, and equilibrium states into the framework of Bayesian inference. This model posits that inference processes can be understood as a series of reactions, with parameters analogous to reaction rates and equilibrium constants. By applying these concepts, we can develop more robust and interpretable models that enhance our understanding of complex systems.
