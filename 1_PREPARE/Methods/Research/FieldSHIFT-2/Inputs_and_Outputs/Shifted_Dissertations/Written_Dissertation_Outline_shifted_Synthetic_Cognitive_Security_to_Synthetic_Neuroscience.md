Cognitive psychology provides critical insights into cognitive biases and decision-making processes, offering a framework for understanding how individuals process information and make judgments. Key theories, such as Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory, highlight the systematic biases that can influence decision-making. In the realm of neural networks, theories related to learning algorithms and synaptic plasticity inform the design of models that can adapt and learn from data inputs, enabling them to mimic human cognitive processes more effectively.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The integration of cognitive security principles into neural network design necessitates the development of new theoretical constructs. This dissertation proposes a theoretical model that incorporates concepts such as cognitive resilience—defined as the ability of a system to maintain functionality despite exposure to misinformation—and bias adjustment layers—mechanisms designed to actively correct for biases present in training data.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation presents a comprehensive model illustrating the interconnections between cognitive security and neural networks. The model emphasizes the feedback loops between cognitive processes and neural adaptations, highlighting how cognitive resilience can inform the design of neural networks that are more robust against adversarial influences. By visualizing these interconnections, the model serves as a foundation for further empirical research and practical applications.
