### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Cognitive Security
Cognitive security has evolved from the broader fields of psychology and information security. It focuses on understanding how cognitive biases can affect decision-making processes, particularly in high-stakes environments such as military operations and cybersecurity. Key concepts include misinformation, cognitive overload, and the impact of social media on public perception. The emergence of cognitive security as a distinct discipline reflects a growing recognition of the need to protect cognitive processes from manipulation and distortion.

#### Neural Networks
The historical development of neural network theory can be traced back to the 1940s with the introduction of the perceptron model by Frank Rosenblatt. Over the decades, neural networks have undergone significant advancements, particularly with the advent of deep learning in the 2010s. Contemporary applications of neural networks span various domains, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. The evolution of neural networks has been marked by the development of sophisticated architectures, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, which have dramatically improved performance across numerous tasks.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
