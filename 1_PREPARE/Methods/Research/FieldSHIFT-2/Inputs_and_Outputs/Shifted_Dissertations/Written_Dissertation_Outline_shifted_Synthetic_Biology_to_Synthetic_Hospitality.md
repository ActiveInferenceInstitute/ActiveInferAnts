# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Biological Ecosystem Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of biological ecosystem concepts with guest experience in the hospitality industry. By examining principles such as interdependence, biodiversity, energy flow, resilience, and keystone behaviors from ecology, this research develops a theoretical framework aimed at enhancing guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The findings have the potential to extend beyond the hospitality sector, offering insights for sustainability practices and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately transforming the design and delivery of guest experiences.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on enhancing guest experience through service quality and personalization. With the increasing demand for sustainability and innovation, there is a pressing need for a paradigm shift in how hospitality organizations conceptualize guest interactions and service delivery. The integration of biological ecosystem principles allows for a deeper understanding of the interdependencies and diversity inherent in service offerings, potentially leading to enhanced guest experiences. This perspective not only addresses the immediate needs of guests but also aligns with broader societal goals of sustainability and ecological awareness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two previously distinct fieldsâ€”biology and hospitality. By integrating ecological concepts into hospitality management, this dissertation offers a novel approach to understanding guest interactions and operational strategies. The application of ecological principles can lead to innovative practices that enhance guest experiences while fostering sustainable operations. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the academic discourse but also provides practical frameworks for industry practitioners.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of interdependence and biodiversity from ecosystems enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of energy flow and resilience in service delivery?
3. How can keystone behaviors among staff influence guest satisfaction?
4. To develop a comprehensive model of guest ecosystems that can be applied across the hospitality sector.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of ecological studies has been marked by significant milestones, including the establishment of foundational concepts such as the food web, ecological succession, and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem stability. The work of pioneers such as Charles Darwin and later ecologists has laid the groundwork for understanding complex interdependencies within ecosystems. Conversely, the hospitality industry has evolved from a focus on basic service provision to a more nuanced understanding of guest experience, driven by theories of service quality and customer satisfaction.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary ecological research emphasizes sustainability and resilience, highlighting the importance of maintaining biodiversity and adaptive capacity in response to environmental changes. In parallel, the hospitality sector is experiencing trends toward personalization, technology integration, and service diversity, which are reshaping guest expectations and experiences. This convergence of ecological and hospitality research presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exploration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich literature in both fields, there remains a notable gap regarding the application of ecological principles in hospitality. The potential for ecological concepts to inform service design and delivery has been largely unexplored. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for research that combines insights from both domains, ultimately enhancing guest experiences and operational efficiencies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Ecological theories such as systems theory, resilience theory, and biodiversity theory provide a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of ecosystems. Systems theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of components within a system, while resilience theory focuses on the capacity of systems to absorb disturbances and adapt to change. Biodiversity theory highlights the importance of variety within ecosystems for overall stability and function. In the hospitality domain, theories related to service quality, guest satisfaction, and experience design are essential for understanding the factors that contribute to positive guest experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This research introduces new concepts such as "Guest Ecosystem" and "Service Biodiversity." The "Guest Ecosystem" refers to the dynamic interplay between guests, staff, and the service environment, while "Service Biodiversity" encompasses the variety of services offered and their potential to cater to diverse guest needs. These constructs will inform the development of an integrated theoretical model that merges ecological principles with hospitality management.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed model illustrates the interconnectedness of ecological principles and guest experience elements. It posits that enhancing interdependence and biodiversity within service offerings can lead to improved guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The model serves as a framework for understanding the complex interactions between guests and service providers, ultimately guiding the development of innovative hospitality practices.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the impact of ecological principles on guest experience. This design facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena under investigation, allowing for triangulation of data sources and methodologies.

### Data Collection Methods
Data collection will involve surveys and interviews with hospitality staff and guests to gather insights on service delivery and guest satisfaction. Surveys will quantify guest perceptions of service diversity and satisfaction levels, while interviews will provide qualitative insights into the experiences of both staff and guests. Additionally, case studies of hospitality establishments implementing ecological principles will be conducted to illustrate best practices.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analysis of survey data will identify correlations between service diversity and guest satisfaction, employing techniques such as regression analysis and factor analysis. Thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative data from interviews and case studies, allowing for the identification of key themes and insights related to the application of ecological principles in hospitality.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations are paramount in this research. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring that they are aware of their rights and the purpose of the study. Confidentiality will be maintained, particularly in studies involving personalized guest data, to protect the privacy of participants.
