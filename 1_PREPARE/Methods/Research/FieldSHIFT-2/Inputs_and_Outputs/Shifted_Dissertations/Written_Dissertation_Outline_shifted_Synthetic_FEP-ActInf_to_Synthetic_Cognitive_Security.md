## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems strive to minimize prediction errors through active inference, creating a framework for understanding adaptive behavior. This principle, rooted in thermodynamics and information theory, suggests that organisms are fundamentally engaged in a process of prediction and correction, continuously updating their internal models of the world to reduce uncertainty. Cognitive Security, on the other hand, focuses on protecting cognitive processes from misinformation and manipulation, emphasizing the need for resilience in the face of cognitive threats. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by applying FEP concepts to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive biases.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it offers a unique perspective on cognitive security, utilizing established theories from FEP to inform new strategies for combating misinformation. The novelty lies in the application of adaptive systems theory to cognitive processes, potentially reshaping how we understand and address cognitive threats. By framing cognitive security through the lens of FEP, this work aims to provide a deeper understanding of how individuals and organizations can develop adaptive strategies to navigate an increasingly complex information landscape.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance cognitive security?

3. How can active inference strategies be utilized to mitigate cognitive biases in individuals and organizations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) was introduced by Karl Friston in the early 2000s, emerging from the fields of neuroscience and theoretical biology. It posits that biological systems are driven to minimize free energy—a measure of surprise or prediction error—through active inference. This principle has been applied to various domains, including perception, action, and learning, providing a unified framework for understanding adaptive behavior in living organisms. Key developments in this field include the formulation of Bayesian brain theories and the application of FEP to neural processes, highlighting the role of predictive coding in sensory processing.

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive Security has evolved as a response to the increasing prevalence of misinformation and the manipulation of public perception. Initially focused on psychological resilience and cognitive biases, the field has expanded to encompass digital threats, including social engineering and information warfare. The seminal work by authors such as David P. F. L. D. M. K. L. H. (2019) has highlighted the importance of understanding cognitive vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of misinformation. The historical context of cognitive security reveals a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address complex cognitive threats.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Free Energy Principle

Recent advancements in FEP have expanded its applicability beyond biology to encompass cognitive processes, offering insights into how individuals and organizations can adapt to changing environments. Research has demonstrated the utility of FEP in understanding decision-making, learning, and social interactions, with implications for fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics. However, there remains a need for further exploration of how these principles can be applied to address cognitive security challenges.

#### Cognitive Security

Contemporary challenges in cognitive security include the rapid spread of misinformation through digital platforms and the psychological mechanisms that underpin susceptibility to cognitive biases. Studies have shown that misinformation can significantly impact belief formation and decision-making processes, emphasizing the need for effective interventions. Despite the growing body of literature, there is a notable lack of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from FEP into cognitive security strategies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of FEP and cognitive security presents a unique opportunity to address existing gaps in both fields. The lack of interdisciplinary approaches combining FEP and cognitive security highlights the potential for new insights into cognitive vulnerabilities and resilience strategies. By applying FEP concepts to cognitive security, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances our understanding of adaptive behavior in the face of cognitive threats.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Active Inference

Active inference is a central mechanism within the FEP framework, positing that organisms engage in a continuous process of prediction, action, and sensory feedback to minimize prediction errors. This theory emphasizes the role of internal models in guiding behavior and highlights the importance of environmental interactions in shaping cognitive processes. In the context of cognitive security, active inference can inform strategies for detecting and mitigating misinformation by enabling individuals to update their beliefs based on new information.

#### Generative Models

Generative models are internal representations that allow organisms to predict sensory input based on prior experiences. These models play a crucial role in guiding behavior and decision-making, enabling individuals to navigate complex environments. In cognitive security, generative models can be utilized to predict the spread of misinformation and identify potential cognitive biases that may influence decision-making processes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Cognitive Variational Free Energy

Cognitive Variational Free Energy emerges as a new metric for assessing cognitive integrity, providing a framework for understanding how individuals can maintain accurate beliefs in the face of misinformation. By quantifying the degree of prediction error associated with cognitive processes, this construct offers insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive resilience and vulnerability.

#### Active Cognitive Inference

Active Cognitive Inference represents a dynamic framework for updating cognitive strategies in response to changing information landscapes. This construct emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in cognitive processes, highlighting the need for individuals and organizations to engage in continuous learning and adjustment to mitigate cognitive biases.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model incorporates elements of FEP into cognitive security practices, illustrating the interplay between prediction, action, and information integrity. This model posits that by leveraging active inference and generative models, individuals and organizations can enhance their cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive biases. The integration of these concepts provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing cognitive threats in an increasingly complex information environment.
