## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated by Karl Friston and colleagues, posits that living systems strive to minimize prediction errors through active inference. This principle provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding adaptive behavior across various biological systems, emphasizing the role of internal models in guiding action. Cognitive Security, on the other hand, is an emerging field that focuses on protecting cognitive processes from threats such as misinformation, cognitive biases, and social engineering tactics. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by applying FEP concepts to enhance cognitive resilience, thus providing a robust theoretical foundation for addressing cognitive vulnerabilities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it offers a unique perspective on cognitive security, utilizing established theories from FEP to inform new strategies for combating misinformation. The novelty lies in the application of adaptive systems theory to cognitive processes, potentially reshaping how we understand and address cognitive threats. By proposing an integrated framework that combines insights from both domains, this dissertation aims to contribute significantly to the discourse on cognitive resilience, offering practical applications that extend beyond theoretical exploration.
