## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work is characterized by a profound engagement with themes of imagination, spirituality, and social justice. His major works, such as *Songs of Innocence and of Experience*, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, and *Jerusalem*, reflect a dualistic worldview that emphasizes the tension between opposing forces—innocence and experience, heaven and hell, body and spirit. Blake's artistic style is marked by vivid imagery and symbolic representation, which serve to convey complex philosophical ideas and emotional depth. His belief in the transformative power of imagination positions him as a precursor to modern notions of creativity and holistic understanding.

#### Healthcare Evolution

The evolution of healthcare practices has undergone significant transformations, particularly in the last century. Historically, healthcare was primarily focused on the biomedical model, which emphasized disease diagnosis and treatment. However, there has been a gradual shift towards patient-centered care, which recognizes the importance of addressing the whole person—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This shift is evident in contemporary healthcare practices that prioritize patient engagement, shared decision-making, and holistic approaches to treatment.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Blake Studies

Existing literature on Blake's themes highlights his exploration of creativity and spirituality as essential components of the human experience. Scholars have examined how Blake's work challenges the boundaries of rational thought and advocates for a more profound connection to the imaginative realm. The intersection of Blake's ideas with contemporary discussions on mental health and well-being presents a fertile ground for further exploration.

#### Healthcare Research

Contemporary healthcare literature emphasizes the importance of patient engagement, holistic care, and health equity. Research has demonstrated that incorporating emotional and spiritual support into healthcare practices can lead to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the integration of literary and artistic principles into healthcare methodologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting literary principles with healthcare practices presents an opportunity for innovation. By exploring how Blake's insights can inform contemporary healthcare, this dissertation seeks to fill this gap and propose a framework that enhances patient care through imaginative and holistic approaches.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Romanticism and Imagination

The Romantic movement, of which Blake is a central figure, emphasized the role of imagination in shaping human experience. Theories surrounding creativity suggest that imaginative processes are integral to problem-solving, emotional resilience, and personal growth. Blake's assertion that "the imagination is the body of God" underscores the significance of creativity in understanding the human condition.

#### Holistic Health Models

Holistic health models advocate for the integration of physical, emotional, and spiritual care. These models recognize that health is not merely the absence of disease but a state of overall well-being. The World Health Organization's definition of health encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being, aligning with the principles of holistic care.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Imaginative Healing Model

The proposed Imaginative Healing Model combines creativity with healthcare practices, emphasizing the role of imagination in healing processes. This model posits that engaging patients' imaginations can lead to enhanced emotional well-being and improved health outcomes.

#### Holistic Duality Theory

Holistic Duality Theory emphasizes the balance between clinical interventions and emotional/spiritual support. This construct suggests that effective healthcare requires an understanding of the interplay between physical health and the emotional/spiritual dimensions of patient care.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between Blake's principles and healthcare practices. Key components of this model include imagination, duality, spirituality, and social justice, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of patient-centered care. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the practical applications of Blake's insights in healthcare settings.
