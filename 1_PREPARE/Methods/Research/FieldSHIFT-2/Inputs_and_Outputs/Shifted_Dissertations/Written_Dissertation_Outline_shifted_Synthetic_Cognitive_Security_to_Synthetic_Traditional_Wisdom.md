# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

Cognitive security is a relatively new field that focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, misinformation, and external influences that can distort understanding and decision-making. It encompasses a range of strategies aimed at protecting individuals and communities from cognitive threats, including disinformation campaigns and psychological manipulation. In contrast, traditional knowledge refers to the accumulated wisdom, practices, and cultural expressions of indigenous communities, often passed down through generations. This knowledge is rooted in the specific ecological, cultural, and historical contexts of these communities.

The convergence of cognitive security and traditional knowledge presents a unique opportunity to address the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional knowledge systems amidst the rapidly changing information landscape. As misinformation proliferates and the digital age reshapes how knowledge is created and shared, indigenous wisdom faces unprecedented challenges. This dissertation seeks to explore how cognitive security principles can be integrated into traditional knowledge frameworks, thereby enhancing their resilience against cognitive threats.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to fill a critical gap in understanding how cognitive security principles can be effectively integrated into traditional knowledge frameworks. While there has been considerable discourse on cognitive security and traditional knowledge in isolation, this research offers a novel perspective on cultural resilience. By examining the intersection of these domains, the study aims to contribute to the safeguarding of diverse knowledge systems against cognitive threats, ultimately enhancing community empowerment and cultural integrity.

Moreover, this research is timely and relevant, as it responds to the urgent need for innovative solutions to protect indigenous knowledge in the face of globalization and technological change. The findings of this dissertation will not only contribute to academic discourse but also offer practical applications for policy-making, community resilience, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by the following research questions:

1. How can cognitive security principles be applied to enhance the preservation of traditional knowledge?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Cognitive Security

The evolution of cognitive security can be traced back to the emergence of psychological theories that address how individuals process information and make decisions. Foundational theories, such as cognitive dissonance theory, highlight the discomfort individuals experience when confronted with conflicting beliefs, which can lead to changes in attitudes or behaviors. As the digital age has progressed, cognitive security has gained prominence in response to the proliferation of misinformation, particularly during political campaigns and public health crises. Contemporary research in cognitive security emphasizes the need for strategies to safeguard cognitive processes and promote critical thinking.

### Traditional Knowledge

Traditional knowledge has deep historical roots, serving as the foundation of cultural identity for indigenous communities worldwide. This knowledge encompasses a wide range of practices, including agriculture, medicine, and spiritual beliefs, often closely tied to the natural environment. However, traditional knowledge systems face significant challenges in the modern world, including loss of language, cultural assimilation, and the appropriation of indigenous knowledge by external entities. The historical significance of traditional knowledge cannot be overstated, as it represents a unique worldview that has evolved over centuries.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Cognitive Security

Current research trends in cognitive security focus on understanding the mechanisms of misinformation, the role of social media in shaping public perception, and the psychological underpinnings of belief formation. Key findings suggest that cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and availability heuristic, play a critical role in how individuals process information. Methodologies employed in this field include experimental studies, surveys, and content analysis of media narratives.

### Traditional Knowledge

The literature on traditional knowledge preservation highlights various strategies employed by communities to safeguard their cultural heritage. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of community-led initiatives, such as oral history projects, cultural revitalization programs, and the use of digital technologies for documentation. Best practices emphasize the importance of community engagement and the recognition of indigenous rights in the preservation of traditional knowledge.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich body of literature in both cognitive security and traditional knowledge, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges these two domains. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring how cognitive security principles can inform traditional knowledge preservation efforts. The potential for innovative solutions and frameworks at this intersection presents an opportunity for further research and practical applications.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Cognitive Dissonance Theory

Cognitive dissonance theory posits that individuals experience psychological discomfort when they hold conflicting beliefs or when their actions contradict their beliefs. This theory is relevant to cognitive security, as it highlights the importance of coherence in belief systems. Understanding how cognitive dissonance influences decision-making can inform strategies for countering misinformation and promoting critical thinking.

### Social Constructivism

Social constructivism emphasizes the role of social interactions in shaping knowledge and understanding. This theory underscores the importance of context and community in the transmission of traditional knowledge. By recognizing the social dimensions of knowledge creation, researchers can better understand how cognitive security principles can be integrated into traditional knowledge frameworks.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Cognitive Resilience

Cognitive resilience refers to the ability of individuals and communities to withstand cognitive threats and maintain the integrity of their knowledge systems. This construct emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, media literacy, and community engagement in fostering resilience against misinformation. By developing cognitive resilience, communities can better protect their traditional knowledge from cognitive threats.

### Cultural Integrity

Cultural integrity pertains to the preservation of authenticity in traditional practices and knowledge systems. This construct highlights the importance of maintaining cultural identity in the face of external pressures and influences. Integrating cognitive security principles into traditional knowledge frameworks can enhance cultural integrity by promoting awareness of cognitive biases and fostering community engagement.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes cognitive security principles with traditional knowledge frameworks. The model outlines the interactions between cognitive biases, technology, and cultural practices, illustrating how cognitive security can enhance the preservation of traditional knowledge. By understanding these interactions, researchers and practitioners can develop effective strategies for safeguarding indigenous wisdom.
