## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Ecosystems

The evolution of ecological studies has been marked by significant milestones, including the development of foundational concepts such as energy flow, biodiversity, and resilience. Key figures such as Charles Darwin and Aldo Leopold have shaped our understanding of ecosystems as interconnected networks where species interact with each other and their environment. The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock, posits that the Earth functions as a self-regulating system, emphasizing the intricate balance within ecosystems. Ecological succession further illustrates how ecosystems evolve over time, adapting to changes and disturbances.

#### Cuisine

The historical development of culinary traditions is deeply intertwined with cultural, geographical, and historical influences. From ancient agricultural practices to the globalization of food culture, cuisine has evolved in response to environmental factors and human creativity. The emergence of haute cuisine in France and the subsequent rise of fusion cuisine exemplify how culinary practices adapt and transform over time. The work of culinary historians highlights the significance of regional ingredients and traditional cooking methods, underscoring the importance of biodiversity in shaping culinary identity.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Ecosystems

Current research on ecosystem dynamics emphasizes the importance of conservation and the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Studies have shown that ecosystems with high biodiversity are more resilient to environmental changes, providing critical services such as pollination, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. The role of keystone species in maintaining ecological balance has garnered attention, highlighting the interconnectedness of species within ecosystems.

#### Cuisine

Contemporary culinary trends reflect a growing awareness of sustainability, with a focus on local sourcing, seasonal ingredients, and plant-based diets. The rise of farm-to-table movements and the popularity of sustainable seafood practices illustrate a shift towards more environmentally conscious culinary practices. Globalization has also influenced food culture, leading to the blending of culinary traditions and the emergence of new flavors and techniques.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich literature in both ecology and culinary arts, there remains a significant gap in the integration of ecological principles into culinary practices. This interdisciplinary research presents an opportunity to bridge these domains, fostering innovative approaches to food systems that prioritize sustainability and biodiversity. By examining culinary practices through the lens of ecosystem dynamics, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and contribute to the development of a more sustainable culinary framework.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecosystem Theory

Key theories in ecosystem science, such as the Gaia hypothesis, ecological succession, and the importance of keystone species, provide a foundational understanding of how ecosystems function. The Gaia hypothesis posits that living organisms and their inorganic surroundings interact as a single, self-regulating system. Ecological succession describes the process by which ecosystems change and develop over time, while keystone species are those whose impact on the ecosystem is disproportionately large relative to their abundance.

#### Culinary Theory

Culinary theory encompasses various concepts related to taste, flavor pairing, and the cultural significance of food. The science of flavor pairing, for instance, explores how certain ingredients complement each other, enhancing the overall sensory experience of a dish. Additionally, the cultural context of food influences culinary practices, shaping preferences and traditions that vary across regions and communities.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs such as "culinary ecosystems," "flavor biodiversity," and "energy flow in cooking." Culinary ecosystems refer to the interconnected relationships between ingredients, cooking techniques, and cultural practices, emphasizing the dynamic nature of culinary arts. Flavor biodiversity highlights the importance of diverse ingredients in creating complex and rich flavor profiles, while energy flow in cooking examines how different cooking methods influence the nutritional value and sensory qualities of food.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model developed in this dissertation illustrates the interactions between ingredients, cooking techniques, and cultural practices as a dynamic ecosystem. This model serves as a framework for understanding how culinary practices can be informed by ecological principles, promoting sustainability and enhancing culinary creativity.
