# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Guest Experience Concepts from Hospitality to Entomological Research

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and entomological research. By examining how concepts such as personalization, service quality, technology integration, and sustainability can be transposed into insect research, this work seeks to foster community engagement, enhance data accuracy, and promote biodiversity conservation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform both fields, creating a new paradigm for understanding and valuing insect ecosystems while improving public perception and involvement. This dissertation provides a comprehensive framework for integrating these domains, offering a roadmap for future research and practical applications.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through tailored services and quality interactions. With a history rooted in customer service, the sector has developed a range of strategies designed to personalize experiences, improve service quality, and integrate technology to meet the evolving expectations of its clientele. In contrast, entomological research has primarily concentrated on understanding insect biodiversity, behavior, and conservation without significant emphasis on public engagement or experience. This dissertation explores how principles from hospitality can invigorate entomological research and promote sustainable practices.

In recent years, the decline in insect populations has garnered attention from both the scientific community and the public. Insects play crucial roles in ecosystems as pollinators, decomposers, and food sources for other organisms. Despite their ecological importance, insects often suffer from negative public perceptions, viewed as pests rather than vital components of biodiversity. This disconnect between scientific understanding and public perception presents a unique opportunity to apply guest experience principles to entomological research, fostering a more engaged and informed community.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two disparate fields, creating a novel interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes community involvement and sustainability. By applying guest experience concepts to entomology, this work not only addresses the pressing challenges of declining insect populations but also enhances the societal relevance of insect research. The integration of personalized experiences and high-quality service standards into scientific practices can transform how research is conducted and perceived, ultimately leading to more effective conservation strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can community engagement in insect research enhance biodiversity conservation efforts?
2. What are the impacts of technology-driven citizen science on public perception of insect importance?
3. How can high-quality research standards improve the efficacy of conservation strategies for declining insect populations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Domain A: Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience strategies in the hospitality industry has been profound, with foundational frameworks such as the Service Quality Model and the Experience Economy shaping the approach to customer service. The Service Quality Model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry in the late 1980s, emphasizes the dimensions of service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. This model has guided hospitality practitioners in measuring and improving service delivery.

The Experience Economy, articulated by Pine and Gilmore in 1999, posits that businesses must create memorable experiences for customers to differentiate themselves in a competitive market. This paradigm shift has led to the incorporation of experiential elements into service design, fostering deeper emotional connections between guests and service providers.

#### Domain B: Insect Research

Historically, insect studies have evolved from early taxonomic classifications to contemporary research focused on ecological roles and conservation efforts. The rise of conservation biology in the late 20th century marked a significant shift in the perception of insects, emphasizing their importance in maintaining ecosystem health. However, public engagement with entomological research has remained limited, often overshadowed by more charismatic megafauna.

The evolution of conservation efforts has seen a growing recognition of the need for public involvement in biodiversity initiatives. Despite this, traditional research methodologies often exclude community perspectives, limiting the potential for broader societal engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An examination of current literature reveals a robust body of research on guest experience and its impact on service industries. Studies have demonstrated that personalized services and high-quality interactions lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. In contrast, contemporary entomological research has focused on biodiversity studies, conservation strategies, and the role of citizen science in data collection.

While both fields have made significant strides, the intersection of guest experience principles and entomological research remains largely unexplored. This gap presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, with the potential to enhance community engagement and improve conservation outcomes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals several gaps and opportunities for integration between hospitality and entomological research:

- **Lack of Community Engagement:** Traditional entomological research often neglects community involvement, leading to missed opportunities for public education and advocacy.
- **Limited Application of Service Quality Principles:** The principles of service quality, which have transformed the hospitality industry, are rarely applied in scientific practices, potentially hindering the effectiveness of research initiatives.
- **Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** By fostering partnerships between hospitality experts and entomologists, new methodologies can be developed that prioritize community engagement and sustainability.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Hospitality: Service Quality Theory and Experience Economy Framework

Service Quality Theory provides a foundation for understanding how quality interactions can enhance guest experiences. This theory emphasizes the importance of meeting customer expectations and delivering reliable services. The Experience Economy Framework complements this by highlighting the need for businesses to create memorable experiences that resonate with customers on an emotional level.

#### Entomology: Ecosystem Services Theory and Conservation Biology Principles

Ecosystem Services Theory posits that ecosystems provide essential services that contribute to human well-being, including pollination, nutrient cycling, and habitat provision. Conservation Biology Principles emphasize the need for protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecological integrity. These frameworks underscore the importance of insects in ecosystem functioning and the necessity for their conservation.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of guest experience principles into research methodologies gives rise to new theoretical constructs, including:

- **Community Engagement Model:** This model emphasizes the importance of involving local communities in defining research goals, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for conservation efforts.
- **Personalization in Research:** The application of personalized approaches to research design can enhance community involvement and improve data accuracy.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model incorporates guest experience concepts into the research process, emphasizing personalization, co-creation, and sustainability. This model advocates for a shift in research methodologies that prioritize community engagement and recognize the value of local knowledge in entomological studies.
