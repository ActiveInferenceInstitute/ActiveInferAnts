## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through tailored services and quality interactions. The evolution of this sector can be traced back to the mid-20th century, where the concept of 'guest experience' began to take shape, emphasizing the importance of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Key frameworks, such as the Service Quality Model (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and the Experience Economy (Pine & Gilmore, 1998), highlight the necessity of creating memorable experiences through personalization and high service quality.

In contrast, entomological research has primarily concentrated on understanding insect biodiversity, behavior, and conservation without significant emphasis on public engagement or experience. The historical context of entomology reveals a discipline focused largely on taxonomy and ecological impacts, often neglecting the potential for community involvement. This dissertation explores how principles from hospitality can invigorate entomological research and promote sustainable practices, ultimately enhancing public engagement and awareness of insect ecosystems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two disparate fields, creating a novel interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes community involvement and sustainability. By applying guest experience concepts to entomology, this work addresses the pressing challenges of declining insect populations and enhances the societal relevance of insect research. The potential implications are vast, ranging from improved public perception of insects to innovative conservation strategies that incorporate community insights and contributions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can community engagement in insect research enhance biodiversity conservation efforts?
2. What are the impacts of technology-driven citizen science on public perception of insect importance?
3. How can high-quality research standards improve the efficacy of conservation strategies for declining insect populations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Domain A: Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of guest experience strategies has seen a shift from mere service provision to a holistic approach that encompasses all interactions between a guest and a service provider. The Service Quality Model identifies dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy as critical to enhancing guest experiences. The Experience Economy framework posits that consumers seek memorable experiences rather than just products or services, emphasizing the co-creation of value through engagement.

#### Domain B: Insect Research

Historically, insect research has been characterized by a focus on taxonomy and ecological roles, with early studies primarily concerned with classification and the understanding of species interactions. Over the past few decades, efforts have shifted towards conservation biology, addressing the alarming decline in insect populations and the resultant ecological consequences. However, despite increasing awareness, public perception of insects remains largely negative, often viewed as pests rather than vital components of ecosystems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current literature on guest experience highlights the importance of personalization and service quality in driving customer satisfaction and loyalty in the hospitality sector. In entomological research, there has been a growing emphasis on biodiversity studies, conservation strategies, and the role of insects in ecosystem services. However, the intersection of these two fields remains largely unexplored, presenting a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals several gaps, including a lack of community engagement in entomological research and limited application of service quality principles in scientific practices. These gaps present opportunities for innovative approaches that integrate guest experience concepts into entomological research methodologies, fostering collaboration and enhancing the societal relevance of scientific inquiry.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Hospitality: Service Quality Theory, Experience Economy Framework

Service Quality Theory provides a basis for understanding how service delivery impacts customer satisfaction, while the Experience Economy Framework emphasizes the importance of creating memorable experiences through engagement. These theories can be adapted to enhance the research process in entomology, focusing on the quality of interactions between researchers and community stakeholders.

#### Entomology: Ecosystem Services Theory, Conservation Biology Principles

Ecosystem Services Theory underscores the critical roles insects play in pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. Conservation Biology Principles emphasize the need for sustainable practices to protect biodiversity. Integrating these theories with guest experience concepts can lead to more effective conservation strategies that resonate with the public.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The integration of guest experience principles into research methodologies can lead to the development of a Community Engagement Model in scientific research. This model emphasizes personalization, co-creation, and sustainability, fostering a collaborative approach to insect research that prioritizes community involvement.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model incorporates guest experience concepts into the research process, emphasizing the importance of personalization in research projects, the establishment of high-quality research standards, and the integration of technology to enhance public engagement. This model serves as a framework for understanding and implementing community-engaged entomological research.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This dissertation adopts a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research methodologies. The research design includes case studies of community-engaged insect research projects, allowing for an in-depth exploration of the integration of guest experience principles into entomological research.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection will involve surveys and interviews with community stakeholders, including local residents, conservation groups, and entomologists. Additionally, citizen science data collection will be facilitated through the development of mobile applications, enabling community members to contribute to data gathering efforts.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis will be employed to evaluate survey data, identifying trends and correlations related to community engagement and public perception of insects. Thematic analysis will be utilized for qualitative interviews, allowing for the identification of key themes and insights related to community involvement in insect research.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and measures will be implemented to address potential biases in community engagement. This includes ensuring diverse representation in research projects and providing equitable opportunities for participation.
