## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability in their interactions with the environment (Friston, 2010). This principle has been extensively studied within the realms of cognitive science and neuroscience, where it elucidates how biological systems adaptively respond to environmental stimuli. ATM transactions, as a self-service banking mechanism, present a unique opportunity to apply these concepts. By understanding how users interact with ATMs through the lens of FEP, we can optimize user experiences and operational efficiency.

The evolution of ATMs has transformed banking practices, moving from simple cash dispensers to complex interfaces capable of performing a multitude of transactions. This evolution reflects a broader trend in financial technology, where user experience and security are paramount. Given the increasing reliance on ATMs for daily banking needs, it is crucial to examine how principles from cognitive science can inform their design and functionality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to applying cognitive science principles to financial technology. By introducing FEP to ATM design, it aims to bridge the gap between human-computer interaction and financial services. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary nature of the research, which integrates theories from cognitive science with practical applications in financial technology. This integration has the potential to create a more effective and user-friendly banking experience, ultimately leading to increased user satisfaction and security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation will address the following research questions:

1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance ATM transaction efficiency?
2. What role do user expectations and experiences play in the design of ATMs?
3. How can security measures be re-conceptualized to align with the FEP framework?

The objectives of this research are to develop a comprehensive understanding of user interactions with ATMs, propose a theoretical framework for ATM design based on FEP, and evaluate the implications of this framework for transaction efficiency and security.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Development of the Free Energy Principle in Cognitive Science

The Free Energy Principle emerged from the work of Karl Friston, who proposed that biological systems operate under a fundamental principle of minimizing free energy (Friston, 2010). This principle has been instrumental in understanding perception, action, and learning in living organisms. It posits that organisms maintain a model of the world to predict sensory input and minimize the discrepancy between predictions and actual sensory experiences.

#### Evolution of ATM Technology and Its Impact on Banking Practices

The first ATMs were introduced in the late 1960s, revolutionizing the way consumers accessed banking services. Initially designed for cash withdrawal, ATMs have evolved to incorporate a wide range of functionalities, including deposits, transfers, and bill payments. This evolution has significantly impacted banking practices, shifting customer interactions from traditional teller services to self-service models. The proliferation of ATMs has also led to increased accessibility to banking services, particularly in underserved areas.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Existing Literature on the Free Energy Principle and Its Applications

A growing body of literature has explored the applications of FEP across various domains, including neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Researchers have examined how FEP can inform our understanding of cognitive processes, decision-making, and adaptive behavior (Hohwy, 2013). However, there remains a gap in the application of these principles to financial technology and user experience design.

#### Analysis of Current ATM Transaction Processes

Current literature on ATM transactions primarily focuses on user experience, security measures, and operational efficiency. Studies have highlighted the challenges users face, such as complex interfaces and security concerns, which can hinder effective transactions (Huang et al., 2019). Despite advancements in technology, there is limited research on how cognitive principles can be applied to enhance these processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in interdisciplinary research connecting cognitive science and financial technology. By applying FEP to ATM transactions, this research presents an opportunity to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. The integration of cognitive principles into ATM design can lead to more intuitive interfaces, improved user satisfaction, and increased security.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories from Cognitive Science Related to FEP

The foundational theories underpinning the Free Energy Principle include predictive coding and active inference. Predictive coding posits that the brain continually generates and updates a mental model of the environment to predict sensory input (Friston, 2010). Active inference refers to the process by which organisms act to minimize prediction errors by adjusting their beliefs or actions (Friston et al., 2017). These theories provide a robust framework for understanding user interactions with ATMs.

#### Examination of Theories Related to User Experience and Interaction in Financial Technology

User experience (UX) design emphasizes the importance of creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Theories of usability, such as Norman's principles of design (Norman, 2013), highlight the need for clear feedback, simplicity, and user control. Integrating these UX principles with FEP can lead to more effective ATM designs that align with user expectations and behaviors.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The application of FEP to ATM transactions necessitates the development of new theoretical constructs that bridge cognitive science and financial technology. This includes the concept of "transactional affordances," which refers to the perceived possibilities for action that an ATM interface provides to users. By understanding these affordances through the lens of FEP, we can design ATMs that better align with user expectations and minimize cognitive load.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between user interaction, transaction efficiency, and security protocols through the lens of FEP. This model emphasizes the dynamic interplay between user expectations, interface design, and security measures, highlighting how these elements can be optimized to enhance overall user experience.
