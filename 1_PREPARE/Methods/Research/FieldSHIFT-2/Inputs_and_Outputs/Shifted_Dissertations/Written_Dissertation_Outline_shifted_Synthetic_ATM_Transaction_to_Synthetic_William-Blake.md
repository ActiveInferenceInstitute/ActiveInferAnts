## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of ATM transactions and William Blake's artistic philosophy represents a novel interdisciplinary field that examines how transactional experiences can inform the interpretation of art and literature. With the proliferation of digital technologies, financial transactions have evolved into complex user experiences that prioritize accessibility, security, and engagement. Similarly, Blake’s work embodies a rich tapestry of emotional and spiritual inquiry, inviting readers to navigate the depths of human experience. This fusion allows for a deeper understanding of user engagement, accessibility, and the integrity of expression in both financial and artistic contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the humanities and technology, offering a fresh perspective on Blake’s work while introducing innovative frameworks for user experience design in the arts. The novelty lies in applying transactional principles to literary analysis and artistic expression, creating a dialogue between seemingly disparate fields. By viewing Blake’s poetry and art through the lens of transactions, this dissertation proposes a new way to understand the relationship between art, audience, and experience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can Blake’s works function as self-service portals for emotional and spiritual inquiry?
- In what ways can the transaction flow in Blake’s poetry be mapped to user experience design principles?
- What are the implications of viewing Blake’s artistic integrity as a form of security protocol in creative expression?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of the Development of ATM Technology

The evolution of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) began in the late 1960s, revolutionizing the banking industry by providing customers with self-service access to their accounts. The first ATM, created by John Shepherd-Barron in 1967, allowed users to withdraw cash using a plastic card, a concept that has since expanded to include various banking functions. The impact of ATM technology on user experience has been profound, leading to the development of user-friendly interfaces that prioritize accessibility and efficiency. As financial transactions transitioned from traditional banking methods to digital platforms, the importance of user experience design became increasingly evident.

#### Examination of William Blake’s Life, Artistic Philosophy, and the Historical Context of His Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work transcended the artistic conventions of his time. Blake’s philosophy was deeply rooted in a mystical understanding of the human condition, exploring themes of innocence, experience, and the divine. His unique artistic vision challenged the materialism of the Industrial Revolution, advocating for a spiritual and emotional connection to art. By situating Blake’s work within its historical context, this dissertation aims to highlight the relevance of his philosophy in contemporary discussions surrounding user experience and transactional engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Analysis of Existing Literature on ATM Transactions, User Experience Design, and Security Protocols

Current literature on ATM transactions emphasizes the importance of user experience design in enhancing customer satisfaction and accessibility. Research has identified key principles such as usability, efficiency, and security that inform the design of ATMs and digital banking platforms. Additionally, studies have explored the psychological aspects of user interaction, revealing how emotional responses can influence transaction behavior. However, there remains a gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these principles with artistic interpretation.

#### Review of Scholarly Interpretations of Blake’s Poetry, Art, and Philosophical Contributions

Scholarly interpretations of Blake’s work often focus on his unique blend of mysticism, social critique, and artistic innovation. Critics have examined the symbolic nature of his poetry and art, exploring themes of duality, transformation, and the human experience. While existing literature provides valuable insights into Blake’s contributions, there is a lack of research that situates his work within the framework of transactional analysis, thereby limiting our understanding of how his art can function as a medium for engagement and inquiry.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This literature review identifies a significant gap in interdisciplinary research connecting financial technology and literary analysis. By exploring the intersection of ATM transactions and Blake’s artistic philosophy, this dissertation presents an opportunity to develop innovative frameworks that combine user experience principles with artistic engagement. This exploration will not only enrich our understanding of Blake’s work but also provide valuable insights into the design of user experiences in the arts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User Experience Theory

User Experience (UX) Theory emphasizes the importance of designing products and services that prioritize user satisfaction and engagement. Key concepts within UX theory include usability, accessibility, and emotional resonance. By applying these principles to both ATM transactions and artistic engagement, this dissertation aims to create a framework that enhances our understanding of how users interact with art and technology.

#### Transactional Analysis

Transactional Analysis (TA) is a psychological theory that examines the interactions between individuals and their environments, focusing on the behaviors and motivations that drive these interactions. In the context of financial transactions, TA provides insights into user behavior and decision-making processes. By mapping these principles onto Blake’s poetry, this research seeks to uncover the underlying transactional dynamics present in his work.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Artistic Transaction Theory

Artistic Transaction Theory proposes that art and literature can be understood as transactional experiences that facilitate emotional and spiritual inquiry. This framework posits that engaging with art is akin to navigating a transaction, where the audience exchanges their interpretations, emotions, and reflections with the artwork. By applying this theory to Blake’s work, this dissertation aims to illuminate the transactional nature of artistic engagement.

#### Interactivity in Art

The concept of interactivity in art emphasizes the role of audience engagement in the interpretation of artistic works. This framework recognizes that the meaning of art is co-created by the artist and the audience, highlighting the importance of feedback loops and collaborative experiences. By examining Blake’s poetry through this lens, this research seeks to explore how his work invites active participation and reflection from readers.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that maps transactional principles onto Blake’s poetic structures and themes. By combining insights from UX theory, transactional analysis, and artistic transaction theory, this model aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between art, audience, and experience. This approach will facilitate a deeper exploration of Blake’s work while offering valuable implications for user experience design in the arts.
