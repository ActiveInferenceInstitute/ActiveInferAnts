## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Development of ATM Technology

The development of ATM technology began in the late 1960s, with the first ATM installed in London in 1967. This innovation transformed banking by providing customers with 24/7 access to their accounts, enabling them to perform transactions without the need for human interaction. The impact of ATMs on banking practices has been profound, leading to increased efficiency, reduced operational costs for banks, and enhanced customer experiences. The user interface design of ATMs has evolved significantly, prioritizing accessibility and user satisfaction.

#### William Blake’s Life and Artistic Philosophy

William Blake (1757–1827) was a visionary poet, painter, and printmaker whose work transcended the artistic norms of his time. His philosophy emphasized the importance of imagination, spirituality, and the interconnectedness of all things. Blake's artistic output includes illuminated books, poetry, and engravings, which reflect his belief in the power of the human spirit to transcend material constraints. His works often grapple with themes of innocence and experience, the divine and the earthly, and the tension between individual creativity and societal norms.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### ATM Transactions and User Experience Design

Existing literature on ATM transactions highlights the importance of user experience design in creating intuitive and efficient interfaces. Research has focused on usability, accessibility, and the emotional responses of users during financial transactions. User experience theory emphasizes the need for designs that cater to diverse user groups, ensuring that financial services are inclusive and engaging.

#### Scholarly Interpretations of Blake’s Work

Scholarly interpretations of Blake’s poetry and art have explored themes of mysticism, social critique, and the role of the artist in society. Critics have examined Blake's unique use of language, symbolism, and visual elements, revealing layers of meaning that invite deep engagement. However, there remains a gap in the interdisciplinary exploration of Blake’s work through the lens of transactional theory.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identification of gaps in the existing literature highlights the lack of interdisciplinary research connecting financial technology and literary analysis. This dissertation presents an opportunity to innovate frameworks that combine user experience principles with artistic engagement, thus enriching both fields. By bridging these domains, the research aims to foster a deeper understanding of how transactional experiences can enhance the interpretation of art and literature.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User Experience Theory

User experience theory focuses on the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service, emphasizing accessibility, engagement, and satisfaction. Key principles include usability, emotional resonance, and the importance of feedback mechanisms. This theory is essential for understanding how users navigate financial transactions and how similar principles can be applied to artistic engagement.

#### Transactional Analysis

Transactional analysis provides a framework for understanding user behavior in financial transactions. This theory examines the interactions between users and systems, emphasizing the importance of flow, feedback, and satisfaction in the transactional experience. By applying these principles to Blake's poetry, we can explore how readers engage with texts and derive meaning.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Artistic Transaction Theory

Artistic Transaction Theory proposes that engagement with art and literature can be viewed as a transactional experience, wherein the audience interacts with the work to derive emotional and intellectual value. This framework allows for the examination of how Blake’s works serve as portals for personal inquiry and reflection.

#### Interactivity in Art

Interactivity in art emphasizes the role of audience engagement in the interpretation of artistic works. This concept suggests that the meaning of art is co-created through the interaction between the artist and the audience, highlighting the dynamic nature of artistic expression.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model maps transactional principles onto Blake’s poetic structures and themes, creating a framework for analyzing the reader's engagement with his works. This model will facilitate a deeper understanding of how transactional dynamics can inform artistic interpretation, enhancing the dialogue between the fields of user experience design and literary analysis.
