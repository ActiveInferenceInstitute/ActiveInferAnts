## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Ecosystem Studies and Their Core Principles

Biological ecosystems are characterized by complex interrelations among various organisms and their environment. Central to ecological studies are concepts such as biodiversity, interdependence, and resilience. Biodiversity refers to the variety of life forms within a given ecosystem, which contributes to its stability and adaptability. Interdependence highlights the reliance of species on one another for survival, while resilience pertains to the ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances.

#### Examination of Logistics Evolution, Focusing on Efficiency and Cost Management

Logistics has historically been rooted in principles of efficiency and cost management, with a focus on optimizing supply chain operations. The evolution of logistics can be traced from traditional inventory management practices to contemporary approaches that incorporate advanced technologies such as automation, data analytics, and real-time tracking. However, this focus on efficiency often neglects the dynamic and interconnected nature of supply chains, leading to vulnerabilities in times of disruption.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Current Research in Ecology

Recent research in ecology emphasizes the importance of interdependence and biodiversity in fostering resilience within ecosystems. Studies have shown that ecosystems with high biodiversity are better equipped to withstand environmental changes and disturbances. Furthermore, the concept of ecological networks has gained traction, highlighting the intricate relationships among species and their roles within the ecosystem.

#### Analysis of Contemporary Logistics Practices

In logistics, contemporary practices are increasingly recognizing the need for sustainability and adaptability. The rise of concepts such as circular supply chains, green logistics, and sustainable sourcing reflects an awareness of the environmental impact of logistics operations. However, there remains a gap in fully integrating ecological principles into logistics management, which this research aims to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of the Disconnect Between Ecological Principles and Logistics Practices

Despite advancements in both fields, a significant disconnect persists between ecological principles and logistics practices. While ecological studies have extensively explored concepts of resilience and interdependence, logistics has primarily focused on linear models of efficiency and optimization. This gap presents an opportunity for innovative research that can bridge the two domains, leading to more resilient and adaptive logistics networks.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Innovation in Logistics

The application of ecological concepts to logistics practices presents numerous opportunities for innovation. By embracing principles such as diversity, interdependence, and adaptability, logistics can evolve into a more sustainable and resilient discipline. This research seeks to identify and develop these innovative approaches, paving the way for a new paradigm in supply chain management.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecological Interdependence and Resilience Theories

Ecological interdependence refers to the mutual reliance among species within an ecosystem, which is essential for maintaining balance and stability. Resilience theories focus on the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change. These theories provide a foundational understanding of how interconnected systems operate and adapt, serving as a basis for integrating ecological principles into logistics.

#### Supply Chain Management Theories Focusing on Efficiency and Optimization

Supply chain management theories have traditionally emphasized efficiency, cost reduction, and optimization. Theories such as the Lean Supply Chain and the Theory of Constraints have provided frameworks for identifying and eliminating waste within logistics operations. However, these theories often overlook the complexities and interdependencies inherent in supply chains, necessitating a shift towards more holistic approaches that incorporate ecological principles.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Concept of "Logistics Ecosystem"

The concept of a "Logistics Ecosystem" emerges as an interconnected network of stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. This framework emphasizes the interdependence of various players within the logistics network and the importance of collaboration for enhancing overall system performance. By viewing logistics as an ecosystem, this research aims to foster a more comprehensive understanding of supply chain dynamics.

#### Development of "Supply Chain Biodiversity"

"Supply Chain Biodiversity" serves as a measure of resilience within logistics networks, reflecting the variety of solutions and strategies employed to meet logistical challenges. This construct emphasizes the importance of diversity in enhancing adaptability and reducing vulnerabilities within supply chains. By integrating this concept into logistics management, organizations can better prepare for disruptions and uncertainties.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes ecological principles with logistics management. The model highlights key components such as interdependence, diversity, and resilience, illustrating how these elements can enhance logistical performance. By adopting this model, logistics practitioners can develop more robust and adaptive supply chain strategies that align with ecological principles.
