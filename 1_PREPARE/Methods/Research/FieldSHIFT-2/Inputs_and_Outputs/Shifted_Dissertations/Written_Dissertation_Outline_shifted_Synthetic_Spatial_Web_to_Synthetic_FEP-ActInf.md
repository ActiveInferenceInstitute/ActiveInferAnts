## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative intersection of the Spatial Web and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a novel framework for understanding adaptive systems. By integrating the interactive, data-rich nature of the Spatial Web with the predictive processing and active inference mechanisms of the FEP, this research aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical model and empirical strategies that illuminate how organisms can minimize variational free energy through enhanced interaction with their environments. The potential impact of this work spans multiple disciplines, including cognitive science, urban planning, and technology development, offering new insights into decision-making, learning, and adaptive behaviors.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift in how digital and physical environments converge, creating a dynamic landscape in which users can interact seamlessly with both realms. This integration is facilitated by technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT), which collectively enhance user experiences by overlaying digital information onto the physical world. The Spatial Web enables real-time interactions that are contextually aware, adaptive, and responsive to user behavior, thereby transforming the way individuals perceive and navigate their environments.

In contrast, the Free Energy Principle offers a theoretical foundation for understanding how living systems maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments. Grounded in concepts from neuroscience and cognitive science, the FEP posits that organisms minimize variational free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle elucidates the mechanisms by which living entities predict sensory inputs and adjust their actions to align with environmental realities, ultimately striving for a state of equilibrium.

This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, exploring the implications of their integration for understanding adaptive behaviors. By examining how the Spatial Web can enhance predictive processing and active inference, we can better understand the dynamic interplay between organisms and their environments.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The convergence of the Spatial Web and FEP represents a significant advancement in our understanding of adaptive systems. Despite the rapid advancements in both fields, there remains a critical gap in interdisciplinary research that connects these domains. By investigating how augmented reality, IoT, and contextual awareness can inform predictive processing, this research addresses these gaps and offers a fresh perspective on how organisms navigate and respond to complex environments.

The novelty of this research lies not only in the theoretical integration of these two domains but also in the development of empirical strategies that can be applied across various disciplines. The findings have the potential to inform decision-making processes in cognitive science, enhance urban planning strategies, and drive technology development in smart environments. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
