# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Guest Experience in Hospitality

The evolution of service quality models has played a pivotal role in shaping the hospitality industry. Early models emphasized tangible aspects of service delivery, while more contemporary approaches, such as the SERVQUAL model, underscore the importance of perceived quality and customer expectations. The shift towards personalized guest interactions has been driven by advancements in technology, enabling organizations to tailor services to individual preferences. Furthermore, the impact of technology on guest experience cannot be overstated; innovations such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed how guests interact with hospitality services.

### Buckminster Fuller’s Design Philosophy

Buckminster Fuller’s design principles emerged in response to the complexities of the 20th century, advocating for holistic approaches to problem-solving. His emphasis on synergetics—a study of systems and their interrelations—encourages a comprehensive understanding of design challenges. Fuller's influence on architecture and design is exemplified in projects like the geodesic dome, which showcases the integration of form and function in sustainable design.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Guest Experience

Current trends in the hospitality industry reflect a growing emphasis on technology integration, with AI and IoT facilitating personalized experiences. Moreover, employee satisfaction has been recognized as a critical component of enhancing guest experiences, as motivated employees are more likely to deliver exceptional service.

### Design Philosophy

In the realm of design, synergetics and tensegrity have gained traction as frameworks for understanding complex systems. Current sustainability practices in architecture and design reflect a shift towards eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient designs, aligning with the principles of Fuller's philosophy.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both hospitality and design, there remains a notable lack of interdisciplinary research combining these fields. This gap presents opportunities to innovate service delivery through design principles, particularly in the context of sustainability. The hospitality industry stands to benefit significantly from insights derived from design science, particularly in fostering eco-friendly practices and enhancing guest experiences.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Service Quality Models

The SERVQUAL model, developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, serves as a foundational theory for understanding service quality in hospitality. This model identifies five dimensions of service quality—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—that are critical in shaping guest experiences. The service-profit chain further elucidates the relationship between employee satisfaction and guest satisfaction, highlighting the importance of a motivated workforce in delivering exceptional service.

### Design Science Principles

Fuller's holistic thinking and systems theory offer a robust theoretical foundation for understanding the complexities of design. Synergetics, which emphasizes the interdependence of components within a system, provides insights into creating adaptive service models. Tensegrity, a structural design principle characterized by the use of isolated components under compression, offers a compelling framework for understanding flexibility in service delivery.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Experience Design Science

Experience design science emerges as a new paradigm for designing guest interactions, focusing on the holistic integration of various elements that contribute to the overall guest experience. This approach emphasizes the importance of creating memorable and meaningful interactions that resonate with guests on multiple levels.

### Synergetic Personalization

Synergetic personalization refers to the dynamic tailoring of experiences based on real-time feedback and interactions. This construct emphasizes the need for hospitality organizations to adapt their services in response to guest preferences and behaviors, fostering a more engaging and satisfying experience.

### Tensegrity Service Structures

Tensegrity service structures represent flexible frameworks for service delivery, allowing organizations to respond swiftly to changing guest needs. This approach encourages the development of adaptable service models that can accommodate fluctuations in demand and guest expectations.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model synthesizes guest experience principles with Fuller's design philosophy, emphasizing sustainability, adaptability, and innovation. This model serves as a framework for understanding the interplay between design science and hospitality management, providing a roadmap for organizations seeking to enhance guest experiences while adhering to sustainable practices.
