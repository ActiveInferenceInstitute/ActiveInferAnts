# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive security and cuisine, proposing a transformative framework that prioritizes the integrity of culinary information and combats misinformation in dietary practices. By examining the parallels between cognitive biases in information processing and flavor perception, the research seeks to establish new theoretical constructs and practical applications that enhance culinary literacy and integrity. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic contributions, influencing food education, policy, and societal health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of cognitive security and cuisine represents a novel domain where cognitive processes intersect with culinary practices. Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding mental processes from misinformation, which can lead to misguided beliefs and unhealthy choices. In contrast, cuisine encompasses cultural and regional cooking practices that are often influenced by historical narratives and social dynamics. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, addressing the growing concerns around culinary misinformation and the integrity of food choices. As society grapples with an abundance of information, the need for cognitive security in understanding food becomes increasingly critical.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in both cognitive security and culinary studies. By applying cognitive security principles to culinary practices, the dissertation introduces an innovative lens through which to examine food integrity and misinformation. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches both fields but also offers practical solutions to contemporary challenges in dietary decision-making. The implications of this research are far-reaching, as it can inform policy decisions, enhance educational curricula, and empower individuals to make informed dietary choices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The research is guided by the following questions:

1. How can cognitive security principles be effectively transposed into the culinary domain to enhance food integrity?
2. What are the cognitive biases that influence culinary preferences, and how do they contribute to the spread of culinary misinformation?
3. What interdisciplinary strategies can be developed to promote culinary literacy and combat misinformation in dietary choices?

The objectives of this dissertation are to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates cognitive security with culinary practices, identify key cognitive biases that affect food choices, and propose educational initiatives that foster culinary literacy.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has evolved as a response to the increasing prevalence of misinformation in the digital age. The literature outlines key theories such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), which posits that individuals process information through two routes: the central route, characterized by careful and thoughtful consideration, and the peripheral route, which relies on superficial cues. This framework has been instrumental in understanding how misinformation can be effectively countered. Methodologies such as social engineering and behavioral analysis have also emerged, focusing on the psychological underpinnings of belief formation and change.

#### Cuisine

The study of cuisine has a rich historical context, encompassing anthropological, sociological, and culinary perspectives. The evolution of culinary practices reflects cultural significance, regional diversity, and the impact of globalization on traditional cuisines. Culinary anthropology examines how food practices are intertwined with identity, social structures, and rituals. Recent trends in fusion cuisine highlight the dynamic nature of culinary practices, as cultural exchanges continue to shape modern food landscapes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in cognitive security, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and misinformation detection, have provided new tools for understanding and combating misinformation. AI algorithms are increasingly utilized to identify misleading information in various contexts, including dietary advice. In culinary studies, there is a growing body of literature focusing on the impact of social media on food choices, the rise of food influencers, and the challenges posed by dietary fads and myths. However, the intersection of these two fields remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting cognitive security and culinary practices. This gap presents an opportunity to develop frameworks that enhance culinary integrity and consumer awareness. By integrating cognitive security principles into culinary studies, this dissertation aims to fill this void and provide a foundation for future research.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security Theories

Key theories in cognitive security include social engineering, which explores how individuals can be manipulated into making decisions based on misinformation. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and availability heuristic, play a significant role in shaping individuals' perceptions and decisions. Misinformation frameworks, such as the Information Manipulation Theory, offer insights into how information is distorted and the psychological mechanisms behind belief persistence.

#### Culinary Theories

Culinary theories encompass the cultural anthropology of food, which examines how food practices reflect social identities and cultural heritage. Flavor perception theories, including the role of sensory experiences in taste preferences, provide a foundation for understanding how cognitive factors influence culinary choices. Culinary traditions highlight the importance of cultural context in shaping dietary practices.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces concepts such as "Culinary Integrity," defined as the authenticity and reliability of culinary information, and "Flavor Literacy," which refers to the ability to critically evaluate and appreciate flavors in food. These constructs aim to bridge the gap between cognitive security and culinary studies, providing a framework for understanding the integrity of culinary information.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model illustrates the interaction between cognitive biases, culinary misinformation, and consumer decision-making. It posits that cognitive biases influence individuals' perceptions of culinary information, leading to misinformation propagation. This model serves as a foundation for exploring the implications of cognitive security in culinary practices.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

The research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the intersection of cognitive security and cuisine. This design allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in culinary misinformation and consumer decision-making.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection will involve surveys and interviews with culinary professionals and consumers to assess perceptions of culinary misinformation. Surveys will quantify the prevalence of cognitive biases and misinformation beliefs, while interviews will provide qualitative insights into individual experiences and attitudes. Additionally, a content analysis of culinary media will be conducted to identify prevalent misinformation and cognitive biases.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis of survey data will be employed to identify correlations between cognitive biases and culinary preferences. Thematic analysis of qualitative data will derive insights into consumer attitudes towards culinary integrity. These analytical approaches will provide a robust understanding of the factors influencing culinary misinformation.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will include ensuring informed consent from participants, protecting their anonymity, and addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis. The research will adhere to ethical guidelines established by institutional review boards.
