## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), rooted in the fields of cognitive science and theoretical biology, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how living systems maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments. At its core, the FEP asserts that biological agents strive to minimize the divergence between their predictions about the world and the actual sensory input they receive. This principle has implications not only for understanding cognition but also for modeling behavior in complex systems.

Conversely, Guest Experience Management (GEM) focuses on optimizing the interactions between guests and hospitality providers. GEM encompasses all aspects of a guest's journey, from pre-arrival communications to in-stay services and post-departure follow-ups. The traditional approach to GEM often relies heavily on reactive strategies that address guest needs after they arise, rather than anticipating and fulfilling them proactively.

This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, leveraging insights from the FEP to enhance GEM practices. By understanding guest behavior through the lens of cognitive science, hospitality businesses can create more personalized and satisfying experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking as it introduces a novel perspective on guest experience through the lens of cognitive science. By utilizing the FEP, the study seeks to establish a new paradigm for understanding guest behavior, leading to improved service design and delivery. The integration of these fields offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation in hospitality management. 

The significance of this research extends beyond theoretical contributions; it has practical implications for the hospitality industry. By adopting a predictive framework based on the FEP, hospitality providers can enhance their operational efficiency, improve service recovery strategies, and ultimately increase guest satisfaction and loyalty.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle was first articulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston and has since gained traction across various disciplines, including cognitive science, psychology, and biology. The principle is grounded in the notion that organisms are essentially prediction machines, continuously generating hypotheses about their environment and updating these hypotheses based on sensory input. This adaptive behavior is crucial for survival, as it allows organisms to minimize their prediction errors and maintain a state of equilibrium.

#### Guest Experience Management

Guest Experience Management has evolved significantly over the past few decades, driven by the competitive nature of the hospitality industry and the increasing expectations of guests. Historically, GEM practices focused on service delivery and operational efficiency. However, with the advent of technology and data analytics, there has been a paradigm shift towards a more guest-centric approach that prioritizes personalization and engagement. The literature reveals a growing emphasis on understanding guest preferences and behaviors as a means of enhancing overall satisfaction.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature on the FEP highlights its applications in understanding cognitive processes, decision-making, and adaptive behavior. However, there is a notable scarcity of research that applies the FEP to practical fields such as hospitality management. 

In GEM, current trends focus on personalization, service consistency, and the use of technology to enhance guest interactions. Challenges such as managing guest expectations and ensuring service recovery remain prevalent. The integration of cognitive science principles into GEM practices represents a significant gap in the literature, which this dissertation seeks to address.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive science and hospitality management presents numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary research. There is a lack of empirical studies that explore the application of the FEP in GEM, particularly in the context of predictive modeling and active inference strategies. This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by establishing a theoretical framework that combines insights from both fields, thereby paving the way for future research and practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The foundational theories underpinning the Free Energy Principle include Bayesian inference and predictive coding. Bayesian inference posits that individuals form beliefs about the world based on prior knowledge and update these beliefs in light of new evidence. Predictive coding, on the other hand, suggests that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and adjusts its internal model based on discrepancies between predictions and actual sensory experiences.

In GEM, established models such as the Service Quality Model (SERVQUAL) and the Experience Economy framework provide insights into the factors that influence guest satisfaction and loyalty. These models emphasize the importance of service quality, personalization, and emotional engagement in creating memorable guest experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces novel constructs such as "Guest Predictive Models" and "Active Service Inference." Guest Predictive Models leverage data analytics to anticipate guest preferences and behaviors, enabling hospitality providers to tailor their services accordingly. Active Service Inference refers to the proactive strategies employed by hospitality businesses to minimize prediction errors and enhance service recovery processes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model combines elements of the FEP with GEM, highlighting the interplay between prediction, feedback, and service delivery. This model posits that by effectively utilizing predictive modeling and active inference strategies, hospitality businesses can create more adaptive and responsive service environments. The model also emphasizes the importance of continuous feedback loops, where guest experiences inform future predictions and service improvements.
