## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

- **Overview of William Blake's Life, Artistic Philosophy, and Literary Contributions**: William Blake (1757-1827) was a poet, painter, and printmaker whose work is characterized by its mystical and visionary qualities. His artistic philosophy emphasized the importance of imagination and the individual's subjective experience. Blake’s dualities—such as innocence and experience—serve as a lens through which to examine the complexities of human existence. His seminal works, including "Songs of Innocence and of Experience" and "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," reflect his belief in the interconnectedness of art and spirituality.
