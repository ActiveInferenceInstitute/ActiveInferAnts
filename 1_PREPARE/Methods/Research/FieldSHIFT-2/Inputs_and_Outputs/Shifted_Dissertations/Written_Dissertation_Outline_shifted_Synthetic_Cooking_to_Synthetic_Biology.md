## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary practices across cultures is a rich tapestry woven from historical, geographical, and social threads. From the early days of foraging and hunting to the development of agriculture and the establishment of trade routes, food preparation methods have transformed significantly. Historical accounts reveal that ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians and the Chinese, developed sophisticated culinary techniques that not only reflected their cultural identities but also their understanding of local ecosystems. The significance of these practices lies in their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, which is a fundamental principle in both culinary arts and ecological science.

#### Ecosystems

The development of ecological theories and concepts has paralleled the evolution of culinary practices. Early ecological thought, rooted in natural history, gradually evolved into more complex theories regarding biodiversity and conservation. The works of pioneers such as Charles Darwin and Aldo Leopold laid the groundwork for understanding ecosystems as dynamic entities characterized by interdependence and resilience. Historical perspectives on biodiversity highlight the importance of preserving diverse species and habitats, which are essential for maintaining ecological balance. This historical context underscores the need for a more integrated approach that recognizes the interplay between culinary practices and ecological health.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cuisine

Recent trends in culinary fusion and sustainable practices have gained momentum in response to growing concerns about food security and environmental sustainability. Chefs and culinary professionals are increasingly exploring local ingredients, traditional cooking methods, and innovative techniques that minimize waste and energy consumption. The role of sensory experiences in culinary arts has also been a focal point of research, emphasizing how flavor, texture, and presentation influence consumer choices and cultural perceptions of food.

#### Ecosystems

Current research on biodiversity, energy flow, and nutrient cycling has advanced our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Studies have revealed the critical role of keystone species in maintaining ecological balance and the impact of climate change and human activities on biodiversity loss. The intersection of culinary practices and ecological science presents an opportunity to explore how food systems can support biodiversity conservation and enhance ecosystem resilience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the growing recognition of the interconnections between culinary arts and ecological science, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that systematically explores these relationships. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovative frameworks that foster sustainability through culinary practices, highlighting the need for collaboration between chefs, ecologists, and policymakers. By addressing these gaps, the Culinary Ecosystem Framework aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how culinary practices can inform ecological management and vice versa.
