## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain**: Blockchain technology emerged from the need for secure and transparent digital transactions, with Bitcoin being the first application in 2009. Over the years, blockchain has evolved to encompass various applications, including supply chain management, healthcare, and identity verification. Key milestones in its development include the introduction of smart contracts by Ethereum in 2015, which expanded the functionality of blockchain beyond simple transactions to programmable agreements.

- **Cognitive Security**: The concept of cognitive security has its roots in cognitive psychology and information warfare. Initially focused on safeguarding cognitive processes from misinformation and propaganda, the field has evolved to address broader challenges, including social media manipulation and the psychological impacts of digital misinformation. Strategies have emerged to combat cognitive biases and enhance critical thinking skills in the digital age.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Blockchain Technologies**: Current blockchain technologies utilize various consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), to ensure data integrity and security. The implications of these mechanisms for data integrity are profound, as they provide a decentralized method for verifying transactions without relying on a central authority.

- **Cognitive Security Strategies**: Existing strategies in cognitive security include misinformation detection algorithms, cognitive bias training programs, and frameworks for protecting cognitive processes. However, these strategies often lack the robust verification mechanisms that blockchain can provide, highlighting a significant gap in the current knowledge landscape.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals critical gaps in current cognitive security strategies that could benefit from blockchain principles. For example, the lack of decentralized verification methods in cognitive security frameworks presents an opportunity for innovation. Additionally, there is potential for developing methodologies that leverage blockchain technology to enhance cognitive security, creating a Shifted Domain that integrates the strengths of both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain Theories**: Key theories in blockchain include decentralized trust, which posits that trust can be distributed across a network rather than centralized in a single entity. Consensus algorithms, such as Byzantine Fault Tolerance, provide frameworks for achieving agreement among distributed nodes, ensuring data integrity.

- **Cognitive Theories**: Cognitive psychology principles, such as the dual-process theory, explain how individuals process information through intuitive and analytical systems. Understanding these processes is crucial for developing effective cognitive security strategies that mitigate misinformation and cognitive biases.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cognitive Consensus Theory**: This proposed theory integrates community consensus mechanisms into cognitive security practices, suggesting that collective verification can enhance the authenticity of information. By involving community stakeholders in the validation process, cognitive security can become more resilient to misinformation.

- **Smart Contract-Driven Cognitive Resilience**: This hypothesis posits that smart contracts can automate cognitive threat responses, providing a structured and efficient means of addressing misinformation in real-time. By codifying responses to specific cognitive threats, organizations can enhance their resilience against misinformation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines blockchain and cognitive security theories, illustrating how they interact to enhance information integrity. The model emphasizes the role of decentralized verification, automated responses, and community engagement in fostering cognitive resilience.
