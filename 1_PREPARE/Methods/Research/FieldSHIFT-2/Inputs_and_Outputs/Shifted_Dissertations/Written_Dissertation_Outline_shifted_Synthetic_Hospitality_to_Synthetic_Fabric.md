## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long been recognized for its emphasis on guest experience, which focuses on personalized service and quality interactions. This sector has developed sophisticated methods to ensure guests feel valued and catered to, fostering a sense of belonging and loyalty. In stark contrast, the fabric industry has predominantly operated within a framework characterized by mass production and fast fashion, often neglecting the individual consumer's needs and preferences. However, the growing demand for customization, sustainability, and ethical consumption presents an opportunity to merge these domains. As consumers become increasingly aware of their purchasing decisions' environmental and social impacts, there is a pressing need for the fabric industry to adopt a more customer-centric approach akin to that of the hospitality sector.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel lens through which to view the fabric industry, advocating for a shift towards a more customer-centric approach. By leveraging insights from guest experience, the study aims to foster innovation and responsiveness within the fabric sector. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, combining established theories and practices from hospitality with the unique challenges and opportunities present in the fabric industry. This study not only aims to enhance customer satisfaction and brand loyalty but also seeks to promote sustainable practices that align with contemporary consumer values.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. **How can principles of guest experience be effectively transposed to enhance customer satisfaction in the fabric industry?**
2. **What frameworks can be developed to measure service quality in fabric retail environments?**
3. **How can technology be integrated into the fabric design process to create a more engaging customer experience?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality
The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the years, rooted in the foundational principles of service quality and customer satisfaction. Early studies, such as those by Grönroos (1984) and Parasuraman et al. (1988), emphasized the importance of service quality dimensions, including reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and responsiveness. These dimensions have been instrumental in shaping the hospitality industry's approach to customer interactions, leading to a focus on personalized service and memorable experiences. The evolution of technology has further transformed guest experiences, allowing for enhanced personalization through data analytics and customer feedback mechanisms.

#### Fabric Industry Traditions
The fabric industry has a rich history, deeply intertwined with cultural craftsmanship and artistic expression. Traditional fabric design often emphasized manual techniques, regional materials, and artisanal skills. However, the rise of industrialization and globalization has led to a shift towards mass production, often at the expense of quality and individuality. This transition has created a disconnect between consumers and the products they purchase, prompting a growing demand for personalized and sustainable fabric options. Understanding this historical context is crucial for identifying opportunities to integrate guest experience principles into the fabric sector.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary practices in hospitality increasingly prioritize guest experience, with a focus on personalization, service quality, and the use of technology to enhance customer interactions. The rise of platforms such as Airbnb and the emphasis on unique, localized experiences illustrate the industry's shift towards customer-centric models. Conversely, the fabric industry faces numerous challenges, including sustainability concerns, the impact of fast fashion, and a lack of personalized offerings. Current literature highlights the need for a paradigm shift in the fabric sector, advocating for a more customer-oriented approach that aligns with modern consumer expectations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the wealth of literature on guest experience in hospitality, there remains a notable gap in the application of these principles within the fabric industry. The lack of customer-centric frameworks in fabric retail creates an opportunity for interdisciplinary innovation. By exploring the intersection of these two domains, this research aims to identify strategies that can enhance customer satisfaction, promote sustainability, and foster brand loyalty within the fabric sector.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theories
Service quality theories, such as the SERVQUAL model developed by Parasuraman et al. (1988), provide a foundational understanding of the dimensions that contribute to customer satisfaction. This model identifies five key dimensions of service quality: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. These dimensions serve as a basis for evaluating service quality in various industries, including hospitality and retail.

#### Customer Satisfaction Models
Customer satisfaction models, including the Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory (Oliver, 1980), emphasize the role of customer expectations in shaping satisfaction levels. This theory posits that satisfaction is determined by the comparison between expected and perceived performance. Understanding these models is essential for developing effective strategies to enhance customer experiences in the fabric industry.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
As this research seeks to transpose guest experience principles to the fabric industry, new theoretical constructs will emerge. The "Fabric Experience Framework" will be developed to encapsulate the unique aspects of customer interactions within the fabric sector. Additionally, Co-Creation Theory in Customer Engagement will be explored, emphasizing the collaborative nature of the customer experience and the potential for consumers to actively participate in the design process.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model will synthesize guest experience principles with fabric industry practices, providing a comprehensive framework for enhancing customer satisfaction. This model will incorporate elements of service quality, customer satisfaction, and co-creation, offering a holistic approach to understanding and improving customer interactions in the fabric sector.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed to explore customer perceptions and experiences in the fabric industry. This design combines qualitative and quantitative research methods, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing customer satisfaction and engagement.

### Data Collection Methods
Data will be collected through surveys and interviews with fabric consumers and industry professionals. Surveys will assess customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and perceptions of service quality. In-depth interviews will provide qualitative insights into the experiences of both consumers and industry stakeholders. Additionally, case studies of fabric retailers implementing guest experience strategies will be conducted to illustrate best practices and innovative approaches.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analysis will be employed to analyze survey data, utilizing descriptive and inferential statistics to identify trends and correlations. Thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative interview data, allowing for the identification of key themes and patterns related to customer experiences and perceptions. This mixed-methods approach will provide a robust understanding of the research questions.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and confidentiality will be maintained to protect their privacy. Additionally, the research will adhere to institutional ethical guidelines, ensuring that the study is conducted with integrity and respect for all participants.
