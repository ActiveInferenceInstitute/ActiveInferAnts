## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long been recognized for its emphasis on guest experience, focusing on personalized service and quality interactions. This sector thrives on creating memorable experiences, where the guest's needs and preferences are prioritized to foster satisfaction and loyalty. In stark contrast, the fabric industry has predominantly operated within a framework of mass production and fast fashion, often neglecting the nuances of customer engagement. However, the growing demand for customization and sustainability presents an opportunity to merge these domains. 

Recent trends indicate a shift in consumer expectations, with an increasing preference for personalized products and sustainable practices. This evolution calls for a re-evaluation of traditional business models in the fabric industry, advocating for a more customer-centric approach inspired by the hospitality sector’s best practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel lens through which to view the fabric industry, advocating for a shift towards a more customer-centric approach. By leveraging insights from guest experience, the study aims to foster innovation and responsiveness within the fabric sector. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the existing literature but also offers practical frameworks that can be adopted by industry practitioners.

The novelty of this dissertation lies in its comprehensive examination of how principles derived from the hospitality industry can be transposed to enhance the fabric industry. This research will provide a structured methodology for integrating these principles, thereby creating a new paradigm for customer interaction in fabric retail and arts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. **How can principles of guest experience be effectively transposed to enhance customer satisfaction in the fabric industry?**
2. **What frameworks can be developed to measure service quality in fabric retail environments?**
3. **How can technology be integrated into the fabric design process to create a more engaging customer experience?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience in Hospitality
A review of the evolution of guest experience concepts reveals that the hospitality industry has continuously adapted to meet changing consumer expectations. Early notions of service quality, as articulated by Grönroos (1982), emphasized the importance of reliability, responsiveness, and assurance. Over time, the concept of guest experience has evolved to encompass personalization, emotional engagement, and the creation of memorable moments (Pine & Gilmore, 1999). 

#### Fabric Industry Traditions
The fabric industry has a rich historical tapestry rooted in craftsmanship and cultural influences. Traditional fabric design was often characterized by artisanal techniques, where the emphasis was placed on quality and uniqueness. However, the advent of mass production in the 20th century shifted the focus towards efficiency and cost-effectiveness, often at the expense of customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Contemporary practices in hospitality increasingly prioritize guest experience through personalized services, loyalty programs, and technology integration. The fabric industry, however, faces challenges such as sustainability, ethical sourcing, and the demand for customization. The juxtaposition of these two fields highlights a significant gap in customer-centric frameworks within the fabric sector.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a lack of customer-centric frameworks in the fabric industry, suggesting an opportunity for interdisciplinary innovation. This research aims to fill this gap by exploring how the principles of guest experience can be effectively transposed to enhance customer satisfaction in fabric retail.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theories
Service quality theories, particularly the SERVQUAL model developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988), provide a foundational understanding of how service attributes influence customer perceptions. This model emphasizes the dimensions of tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, which are critical for assessing service quality in various sectors.

#### Customer Satisfaction Models
Customer satisfaction models, such as the Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory (Oliver, 1980), highlight the importance of meeting or exceeding customer expectations. This theory posits that satisfaction is derived from the comparison between expected and perceived performance, making it relevant for both hospitality and fabric industries.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The “Fabric Experience Framework” is proposed as a new theoretical construct that synthesizes guest experience principles with fabric industry practices. This framework emphasizes personalization, service quality, technology integration, and sustainability as key components of customer engagement.

#### Co-Creation Theory in Customer Engagement
Co-Creation Theory, as discussed by Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004), posits that value is created collaboratively between consumers and businesses. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of the fabric industry, where customer involvement in the design process can lead to enhanced satisfaction and loyalty.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed integrated theoretical model will illustrate the interaction between guest experience principles and fabric industry practices. This model will serve as a foundation for the subsequent empirical research, guiding the development of frameworks for measuring service quality and customer satisfaction in fabric retail environments.

## Methodology

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis:** Quantitative data from surveys will be analyzed using statistical methods to identify trends and correlations.
- **Thematic Analysis:** Qualitative data from interviews will be subjected to thematic analysis to uncover recurring themes and insights related to customer experience in the fabric industry.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and measures will be taken to ensure confidentiality and anonymity.
