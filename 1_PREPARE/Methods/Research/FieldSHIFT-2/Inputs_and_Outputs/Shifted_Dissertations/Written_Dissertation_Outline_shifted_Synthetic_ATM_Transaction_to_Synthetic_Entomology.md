## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### User Experience Theory in Financial Technology

User Experience (UX) Theory emphasizes the importance of understanding user needs, preferences, and behaviors in the design of financial technologies. This theory posits that a positive user experience leads to increased user satisfaction and engagement, ultimately enhancing transaction efficiency. Key principles of UX design, such as usability, accessibility, and emotional engagement, provide a foundation for exploring how similar concepts can be applied to understanding insect behavior.

#### Ecological Theory in Entomology

Ecological Theory in entomology encompasses various concepts related to adaptation, survival strategies, and ecological interactions. This theory highlights the dynamic relationships between insects and their environments, emphasizing the importance of understanding how insects respond to ecological pressures. The principles of ecological theory provide a framework for examining the transactional nature of insect interactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Insect Transaction Theory

Insect Transaction Theory conceptualizes ecological interactions as transactional exchanges, where insects engage in behaviors that optimize resource acquisition, survival, and reproductive success. This theory posits that understanding these interactions through a transactional lens can reveal underlying patterns and strategies that govern insect behavior.

#### Metamorphosis Optimization Hypothesis

The Metamorphosis Optimization Hypothesis posits that environmental optimization during each life stage enhances survival rates and reproductive success in insects. By applying transaction flow optimization principles, this hypothesis seeks to identify the optimal conditions for supporting insect life cycles, ultimately contributing to improved agricultural outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes a comprehensive model that integrates transaction flow, user experience, and ecological interactions. The model aims to provide a new lens for studying both domains, facilitating a deeper understanding of how transaction principles can inform insect behavior and ecological dynamics.
