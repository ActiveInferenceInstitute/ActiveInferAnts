## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), creating a novel framework for understanding adaptive behaviors in biological systems. By systematically transposing concepts from chemistry into the context of cognitive science, this research seeks to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of adaptation and learning. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize educational approaches, inform artificial intelligence design, and inspire new materials that mimic adaptive behaviors. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical underpinnings, empirical investigations, and practical applications of this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of chemical reaction principles, such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics, with the Free Energy Principle, which posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the transformative processes shared between chemical systems and adaptive behaviors in organisms. The FEP, rooted in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, posits that biological systems operate to reduce the difference between expected and actual sensory inputs, thereby maintaining homeostasis and facilitating adaptation. By integrating concepts from chemistry, such as reaction rates and equilibrium states, this dissertation proposes that adaptive behaviors can be better understood through the lens of these foundational chemical principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on how adaptive systems function. The novelty lies in the systematic application of chemical concepts to cognitive and behavioral sciences, providing new insights into learning, adaptation, and stability in complex systems. By establishing a theoretical framework that connects chemical reactions with cognitive processes, this dissertation aims to advance our understanding of both fields and their interrelations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles from chemical kinetics inform our understanding of learning rates in cognitive systems?
2. In what ways can catalytic processes enhance adaptive behaviors in organisms?
3. What parallels exist between chemical equilibrium and biological homeostasis, and how can they inform ecological studies?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

- **Overview of Foundational Theories in Chemical Reactions**: The study of chemical reactions has evolved significantly since the formulation of the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics. Foundational theories such as collision theory and transition state theory elucidate how reactants interact and transform into products. These theories emphasize the role of energy barriers and molecular interactions in dictating reaction rates and pathways.

- **Examination of the Free Energy Principle**: The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Friston (2010), suggests that living organisms minimize free energy through active inference mechanisms. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognition, perception, and action, positing that organisms continuously update their beliefs about the world to minimize surprise and uncertainty.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

- **Summary of Recent Advancements in Chemical Reaction Studies**: Recent advancements in chemical kinetics, particularly in the realm of complex systems and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have revealed deeper insights into how reactions proceed under varying conditions. The development of computational models and simulations has enhanced our understanding of reaction dynamics.

- **Analysis of the Current Understanding of the Free Energy Principle in Adaptive Systems**: The application of the FEP has expanded beyond neuroscience into areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, where predictive coding and active inference are utilized to create adaptive systems that learn from their environments. However, the integration of chemical principles into this framework remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- **Identification of Underexplored Intersections**: Despite the rich theoretical frameworks in both fields, there exists a notable gap in the literature regarding the integration of chemical reaction principles with cognitive science. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by proposing a novel interdisciplinary framework.

- **Discussion of How the Shifted Domain Can Address Existing Gaps**: By applying concepts such as catalysis and equilibrium to cognitive processes, this research aims to uncover new mechanisms of learning and adaptation, thereby enriching both chemical and cognitive sciences.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Key Theories in Chemistry**: Fundamental theories such as collision theory, which posits that chemical reactions occur when reactant molecules collide with sufficient energy and proper orientation, serve as a basis for understanding adaptive behaviors. Additionally, reaction mechanisms elucidate the stepwise transformations that occur during chemical processes.

- **Core Concepts of the Free Energy Principle**: The FEP encompasses concepts such as active inference, which describes how organisms predict sensory input and act to minimize prediction error. Predictive coding further elaborates on this by suggesting that the brain encodes information based on expectations rather than direct sensory input.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Development of Concepts**: This dissertation introduces new constructs such as "Catalytic Cognition," positing that certain cognitive processes function analogously to catalysts, facilitating learning and adaptation without being consumed in the process. "Energetic Learning" is another proposed concept, which emphasizes the role of energy dynamics in shaping cognitive and adaptive behaviors.

- **Exploration of Isomorphisms**: The exploration of isomorphisms between chemical and adaptive processes will illuminate the parallels between reaction dynamics and cognitive learning, providing a robust framework for understanding both domains.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

- **Presentation of an Integrated Model**: The integrated model will synthesize chemical reaction principles with the Free Energy Principle, illustrating how concepts such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics can inform our understanding of cognitive processes. This model will serve as a foundational framework for the subsequent empirical investigations.
