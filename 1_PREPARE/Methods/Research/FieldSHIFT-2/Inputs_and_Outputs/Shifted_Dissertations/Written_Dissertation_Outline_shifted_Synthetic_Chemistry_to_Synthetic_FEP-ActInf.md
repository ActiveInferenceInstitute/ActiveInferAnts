# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Chemistry into the Context of the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the fields of Chemistry and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Active Inference. By establishing a framework that integrates chemical processes with predictive modeling, this research seeks to redefine our understanding of chemical interactions as dynamic, adaptive systems. The transformative potential of this Shifted Domain lies in its ability to provide novel insights into chemical behavior, catalysis, and equilibrium, ultimately leading to advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications in various fields, including materials science, pharmacology, and environmental science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Chemistry, traditionally viewed through a reductionist lens, and the FEP, which emphasizes the adaptive nature of living systems. This integration offers a fresh perspective on chemical reactions, catalysis, and equilibrium, framed as processes that strive to minimize free energy and maximize predictive accuracy. The FEP posits that biological systems function to reduce the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input, a principle that can be transposed onto chemical systems to elucidate how they adapt to environmental changes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it challenges the conventional paradigms of both Chemistry and cognitive science. By viewing chemical reactions as predictive processes, we can develop a deeper understanding of how systems adapt and evolve. This perspective not only enriches our theoretical frameworks but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation, particularly in the realms of catalysis and materials design. The novelty lies in the application of cognitive principles to chemical phenomena, potentially revealing underlying mechanisms that have previously remained obscure.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can chemical reactions be conceptualized as predictive models within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
- In what ways do catalysts enhance predictive capabilities in chemical systems?
- What implications does the integration of these fields have for our understanding of homeostasis and equilibrium in both chemical and biological systems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of Chemistry from alchemy to a rigorous scientific discipline has been marked by significant milestones, including the development of atomic theory and thermodynamics. The transition from qualitative to quantitative analysis in Chemistry laid the groundwork for modern chemical engineering and materials science. Similarly, the FEP has emerged as a pivotal concept in understanding biological systems, drawing from a rich history of cognitive science and neuroscience. Theoretical advancements in these fields have often occurred in isolation, leading to a fragmented understanding of complex systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Chemistry currently emphasizes sustainability and interdisciplinary approaches, with a growing focus on green chemistry and the development of eco-friendly materials. The FEP has gained traction in understanding cognition and behavior, particularly in the context of perception and action. However, there remains a lack of integration between these domains, highlighting the need for a comprehensive exploration of their interconnections. Existing literature primarily addresses either chemical kinetics or cognitive modeling, but rarely do they converge to illuminate the adaptive nature of chemical systems.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The existing literature reveals a gap in understanding how chemical processes can be framed within the context of predictive modeling. This presents an opportunity to explore novel hypotheses and develop new theoretical constructs that bridge these disciplines. By investigating the predictive dynamics of chemical reactions, we can uncover insights that may lead to more efficient catalytic processes and a deeper understanding of chemical equilibrium.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Thermodynamics**: Understanding energy changes in chemical processes is fundamental to both Chemistry and the FEP. The laws of thermodynamics govern the direction and extent of chemical reactions, providing a framework for analyzing energy transfer and transformation.
  
- **Predictive Coding**: This framework posits that organisms minimize surprise through internal models that predict sensory inputs. In the context of chemical reactions, this can be reinterpreted to suggest that chemical systems operate under similar principles, seeking to minimize deviations from expected outcomes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Predictive Catalysis**: This concept involves conceptualizing catalysts not merely as facilitators of reactions but as active participants in the predictive modeling of reaction dynamics. Catalysts may enhance the system's ability to anticipate and respond to changes in reaction conditions.

- **Chemical Homeostasis**: Viewing chemical systems as striving for equilibrium akin to biological homeostasis allows for a broader understanding of how chemical reactions adapt to maintain stability in response to environmental fluctuations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines principles of thermodynamics with predictive coding will be proposed. This model will articulate how chemical processes can be understood as adaptive systems that engage in predictive coding to minimize free energy while navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining experimental research with theoretical modeling to explore the integration of Chemistry and the FEP. This approach will allow for a comprehensive investigation of both the empirical and theoretical dimensions of the research questions.

### Data Collection Methods

- **Experimental Studies**: Laboratory experiments will be conducted to observe the effects of catalysts on reaction dynamics, focusing on how these catalysts influence the predictive modeling of the chemical systems.

- **Computational Modeling**: Simulations will be utilized to model predictive processes in chemical systems, allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and the identification of patterns in reaction behavior.

### Analytical Approaches

- **Statistical Analysis**: Experimental data will be subjected to statistical analysis to identify patterns and correlations, providing insights into the predictive capabilities of different catalysts.

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Theoretical implications derived from computational models will be explored, contributing to the development of the integrated theoretical framework.

### Ethical Considerations

The research will ensure compliance with ethical standards in laboratory research, particularly concerning the use of chemicals and environmental impact. All experiments will adhere to safety protocols and regulations to minimize risks to researchers and the environment.
