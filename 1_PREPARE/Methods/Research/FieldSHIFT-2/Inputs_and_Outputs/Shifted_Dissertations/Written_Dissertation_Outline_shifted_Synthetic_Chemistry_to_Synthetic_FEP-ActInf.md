# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Chemical Reaction Concepts into the Free Energy Principle Context

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), creating a novel framework for understanding adaptive behaviors in biological systems. By systematically transposing concepts from chemistry into the context of cognitive science, this research seeks to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of adaptation and learning. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize educational approaches, inform artificial intelligence design, and inspire new materials that mimic adaptive behaviors. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical underpinnings, empirical investigations, and practical applications of this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of chemical reaction principles, such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics, with the Free Energy Principle, which posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the transformative processes shared between chemical systems and adaptive behaviors in organisms. 

The Free Energy Principle, articulated by Friston (2010), posits that biological systems are fundamentally driven by the imperative to minimize free energy, thereby maintaining homeostasis and adapting to environmental changes. This principle can be likened to the thermodynamic drive of chemical reactions, where systems evolve towards equilibrium. By examining these parallels, this dissertation seeks to elucidate how chemical reaction dynamics can inform our understanding of cognitive processes, thereby enriching both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on how adaptive systems function. The novelty lies in the systematic application of chemical concepts to cognitive and behavioral sciences, providing new insights into learning, adaptation, and stability in complex systems. By framing cognitive processes within the context of chemical reactions, this work challenges traditional views of cognition and adaptation, proposing a more integrated understanding of these phenomena.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles from chemical kinetics inform our understanding of learning rates in cognitive systems?
2. In what ways can catalytic processes enhance adaptive behaviors in organisms?
3. What parallels exist between chemical equilibrium and biological homeostasis, and how can they inform ecological studies?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Foundational Theories in Chemical Reactions

The field of chemistry has evolved significantly since its inception, with foundational theories such as thermodynamics and kinetics laying the groundwork for understanding chemical reactions. Thermodynamics provides a framework for analyzing energy exchanges and spontaneity, while kinetics focuses on the rates of reactions and the factors influencing them, such as temperature, concentration, and catalysts (Atkins & de Paula, 2014). Collision theory and transition state theory further elucidate the mechanisms of reactions, emphasizing the importance of molecular interactions and energy barriers.

#### Examination of the Free Energy Principle and Its Implications for Cognitive Science

The Free Energy Principle, primarily developed in the context of neuroscience and cognitive science, asserts that biological systems function as inference machines, continuously updating their beliefs about the world to minimize prediction errors (Friston, 2010). This principle has profound implications for understanding adaptive behaviors, learning, and decision-making processes in organisms. It posits that organisms actively engage with their environment to reduce uncertainty, akin to how chemical systems evolve towards equilibrium.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Summary of Recent Advancements in Chemical Reaction Studies

Recent advancements in chemical reaction studies have focused on understanding complex reaction networks, the role of catalysts in driving reactions, and the application of computational methods to model chemical dynamics. Research has increasingly emphasized the importance of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the role of information theory in chemical processes (Gaspard, 2004). These developments provide a rich context for exploring parallels with cognitive processes.

#### Analysis of the Current Understanding of the Free Energy Principle in Adaptive Systems

The Free Energy Principle has garnered significant attention in cognitive science, with researchers investigating its applications in understanding perception, action, and learning. Studies have demonstrated how predictive coding models can explain various cognitive phenomena, including attention and memory (Clark, 2013). However, the integration of chemical principles into this framework remains underexplored, presenting an opportunity for novel insights.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of chemical reactions and adaptive behaviors represents a largely uncharted territory in both fields. Despite the established frameworks in chemistry and cognitive science, the potential for cross-disciplinary insights remains largely untapped. This Shifted Domain can address existing gaps by providing a cohesive framework that integrates chemical principles into the study of cognition and adaptation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in Chemistry

Key theories in chemistry, such as collision theory and reaction mechanisms, provide essential insights into the dynamics of chemical reactions. Collision theory posits that for a reaction to occur, reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy and proper orientation. Reaction mechanisms, on the other hand, describe the stepwise sequence of elementary reactions that lead to the overall transformation of reactants into products (Laidler, 1987). These theories underscore the importance of interactions and energy exchanges in chemical processes.

#### Core Concepts of the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle encompasses several core concepts, including active inference and predictive coding. Active inference posits that organisms engage in a continuous process of updating their beliefs and actions to minimize prediction errors. Predictive coding, a related concept, suggests that the brain encodes information by predicting sensory inputs and adjusting its beliefs based on discrepancies between predictions and actual inputs (Friston et al., 2017). These concepts highlight the dynamic nature of cognitive processes and their parallels with chemical reactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of Concepts such as "Catalytic Cognition" and "Energetic Learning"

The integration of chemical principles into cognitive science gives rise to new theoretical constructs, such as "Catalytic Cognition," which posits that certain cognitive processes act as catalysts for learning and adaptation. This concept draws parallels between the role of catalysts in chemical reactions and the mechanisms that facilitate cognitive processes. "Energetic Learning" emerges as another construct, emphasizing the role of energy dynamics in shaping learning experiences and adaptive behaviors.

#### Exploration of Isomorphisms Between Chemical and Adaptive Processes

Isomorphisms between chemical and adaptive processes provide a framework for understanding the similarities in dynamics across these domains. For instance, the concept of equilibrium in chemical systems can be paralleled with homeostasis in biological systems, where both seek to maintain stability in the face of external perturbations. By exploring these isomorphisms, this dissertation seeks to establish a cohesive theoretical framework that bridges the disciplines.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated model synthesizes chemical reaction principles with the Free Energy Principle, illustrating their interconnections. This model posits that adaptive behaviors in organisms can be understood through the lens of chemical dynamics, where learning and adaptation mirror the processes of chemical transformations. By framing cognitive processes within this model, the dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of adaptation.
