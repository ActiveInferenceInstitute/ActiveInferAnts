# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Chemistry into the Context of the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the fields of Chemistry and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Active Inference. By establishing a framework that integrates chemical processes with predictive modeling, this research seeks to redefine our understanding of chemical interactions as dynamic, adaptive systems. The transformative potential of this Shifted Domain lies in its ability to provide novel insights into chemical behavior, catalysis, and equilibrium, ultimately leading to advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications in various fields, including materials science, pharmacology, and environmental science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Chemistry, traditionally viewed through a reductionist lens, and the FEP, which emphasizes the adaptive nature of living systems. The FEP posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding, where organisms continuously update their internal models of the world to reduce the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory inputs. This dissertation proposes that chemical reactions, similarly, can be conceptualized as processes that minimize free energy and maximize predictive accuracy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it challenges the conventional paradigms of both Chemistry and cognitive science. By viewing chemical reactions as predictive processes, we can develop a deeper understanding of how systems adapt and evolve. This perspective not only enhances our theoretical understanding but also opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation. The novelty of this research lies in its potential to redefine chemical interactions, thereby influencing fields such as materials science, pharmacology, and environmental science.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can chemical reactions be conceptualized as predictive models within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
2. In what ways do catalysts enhance predictive capabilities in chemical systems?
3. What implications does the integration of these fields have for our understanding of homeostasis and equilibrium in both chemical and biological systems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of Chemistry from alchemy to a rigorous scientific discipline has been marked by significant milestones, including the development of atomic theory and thermodynamics. The birth of modern Chemistry in the 18th century, spearheaded by figures such as Antoine Lavoisier and John Dalton, established foundational principles that govern chemical reactions. Similarly, the FEP has emerged as a pivotal concept in understanding biological systems, drawing from a rich history of cognitive science and neuroscience. The FEP, articulated by Karl Friston, integrates insights from thermodynamics, information theory, and Bayesian inference to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how living systems maintain their organization in the face of environmental perturbations.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Chemistry currently emphasizes sustainability and interdisciplinary approaches, with a growing focus on green chemistry and the development of sustainable materials. The FEP has gained traction in understanding cognition and behavior, particularly in the context of perception, action, and learning. However, there remains a lack of integration between these domains, highlighting the need for a comprehensive exploration of their interconnections. The existing literature primarily treats chemical processes and cognitive processes as disparate entities, failing to recognize the potential synergies that may arise from their integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The existing literature reveals a gap in understanding how chemical processes can be framed within the context of predictive modeling. This presents an opportunity to explore novel hypotheses and develop new theoretical constructs that bridge these disciplines. By investigating the predictive nature of chemical reactions and the role of catalysts in enhancing predictive accuracy, this research aims to fill this gap and contribute to a more cohesive understanding of adaptive systems.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Thermodynamics**: The principles of thermodynamics provide a foundational understanding of energy changes in chemical processes. The first and second laws of thermodynamics elucidate the conservation of energy and the tendency of systems to move towards increased entropy, respectively. These principles are crucial for understanding chemical equilibrium and reaction spontaneity.

- **Predictive Coding**: This framework posits that organisms minimize surprise through internal models. In the context of chemical systems, predictive coding can be applied to understand how chemical reactions anticipate changes in their environment and adjust accordingly to maintain stability or achieve desired outcomes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Predictive Catalysis**: This construct conceptualizes catalysts as facilitators of predictive modeling in chemical reactions. Catalysts, by lowering activation energy and providing alternative reaction pathways, can be viewed as agents that enhance the predictive capabilities of chemical systems, allowing them to adapt more effectively to environmental changes.

- **Chemical Homeostasis**: This concept draws parallels between the equilibrium states of chemical systems and biological homeostasis. Just as living organisms strive to maintain internal stability amidst external fluctuations, chemical systems can be understood as seeking equilibrium through dynamic adjustments in response to changes in their environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines principles of thermodynamics with predictive coding will be proposed. This model will provide a cohesive understanding of chemical processes as adaptive systems that continuously update their internal representations to minimize free energy and maximize predictive accuracy. The model will serve as a foundation for exploring the implications of this integration for both Chemistry and cognitive science.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining experimental research with theoretical modeling to explore the integration of Chemistry and the FEP. This approach allows for a comprehensive investigation of the proposed hypotheses, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative data.

### Data Collection Methods

- **Experimental Studies**: Laboratory experiments will be conducted to observe the effects of catalysts on reaction dynamics. These experiments will involve varying reaction conditions and measuring reaction rates, product yields, and the influence of catalysts on the predictability of outcomes.

- **Computational Modeling**: Simulations will be utilized to model predictive processes in chemical systems. These models will incorporate principles of thermodynamics and predictive coding to simulate how chemical reactions adapt to changing conditions and optimize their predictive accuracy.

### Analytical Approaches

- Statistical analysis of experimental data will be employed to identify patterns and correlations between catalyst presence, reaction dynamics, and predictive accuracy. Techniques such as regression analysis and ANOVA will be utilized to assess the significance of findings.

- Theoretical analysis will be conducted to derive implications from computational models, exploring how the integration of predictive coding and thermodynamics can enhance our understanding of chemical behavior.

### Ethical Considerations

Compliance with ethical standards in laboratory research will be ensured, particularly concerning the use of chemicals and environmental impact. All experiments will be conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines, and appropriate measures will be taken to minimize any potential harm to the environment.
