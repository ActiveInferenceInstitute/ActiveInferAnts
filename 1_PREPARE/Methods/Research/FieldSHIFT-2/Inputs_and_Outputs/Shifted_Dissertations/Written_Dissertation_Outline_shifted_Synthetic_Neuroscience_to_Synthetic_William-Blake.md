## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The development of neuroscience has evolved significantly, from early neuroanatomy, where the focus was primarily on the structure of the brain, to contemporary cognitive neuroscience, which emphasizes the functional aspects of brain activity. Key milestones include the discovery of neurons, the development of neuroimaging technologies, and the growing understanding of brain plasticity.

In parallel, William Blake’s life and work were deeply embedded in the Romantic movement, a period characterized by an emphasis on emotion, individualism, and a connection to nature. Blake's philosophy was influenced by the Enlightenment and the socio-political upheavals of his time, which shaped his artistic vision and thematic explorations.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent findings in neuroscience have illuminated various aspects of creativity, cognition, and emotional processing. Studies on neural correlates of creativity have identified specific brain networks associated with divergent thinking and artistic expression. Furthermore, research on emotional processing has underscored the role of neurotransmitters in shaping our emotional responses to art.

In Blake studies, scholarship has traditionally focused on thematic interpretations, symbolism, and artistic techniques. However, there is a growing interest in understanding the psychological and emotional dimensions of his work, which can be enriched by neuroscientific insights.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the rich potential for interdisciplinary research, there exists a notable gap in scholarship connecting neuroscience and art. This dissertation aims to fill this void by exploring how neuroscientific concepts can provide new interpretations of Blake's work, particularly in understanding creativity and emotional engagement. The integration of these fields opens up opportunities for novel insights into the cognitive processes involved in artistic expression.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Key theories in neuroscience, such as neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmission, provide a foundation for understanding the cognitive processes involved in creativity. Neural networks, comprising interconnected neurons, facilitate information processing and are essential for creative thought. Synaptic plasticity, the brain's ability to strengthen or weaken synapses based on activity, underlies learning and adaptation, crucial for artistic evolution.

In contrast, Blake's philosophical beliefs, rooted in his mystical worldview, emphasize the interconnectedness of imagination, perception, and reality. His artistic principles, characterized by a synthesis of text and image, reflect a profound engagement with the human experience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This dissertation proposes integrated constructs such as "Neural Imagery" and "Creative Neurotransmission." Neural Imagery refers to the cognitive visualization processes that occur when engaging with art, while Creative Neurotransmission pertains to the biochemical processes that facilitate emotional and cognitive responses to artistic stimuli. These constructs will facilitate a deeper understanding of Blake's work by linking cognitive neuroscience with artistic expression.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated theoretical model will be presented to illustrate the interactions between cognitive processes, emotional engagement, and artistic expression. This model will serve as a framework for analyzing Blake's poetry and visual art, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between neuroscience and creativity.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative analysis of Blake’s works with quantitative neuroscientific research. This approach allows for a comprehensive exploration of the cognitive and emotional dimensions of Blake’s artistic expression.

### Data Collection Methods
Data collection will involve textual analysis of Blake’s poetry and visual art, focusing on thematic elements, imagery, and emotional resonance. Additionally, neuroimaging studies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), will be conducted to assess brain activity in response to Blake’s works, providing empirical evidence of cognitive engagement.

### Analytical Approaches
Thematic analysis will be employed to identify key motifs and emotional themes in Blake's texts and images. Statistical analysis of neuroimaging data will be conducted to identify correlations between cognitive engagement and emotional responses, providing insights into the neural underpinnings of artistic appreciation.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will be paramount in conducting human subject research in neuroimaging. Informed consent will be obtained from participants, and measures will be taken to ensure the respectful interpretation of Blake's work in the context of neuroscience. The research will adhere to ethical guidelines established by relevant institutional review boards.
