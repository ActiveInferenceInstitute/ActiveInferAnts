## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges the empirical rigor of neuroscience with the rich, imaginative world of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art. This fusion allows for a nuanced exploration of how cognitive processes influence creative expression and vice versa. Neuroscience, as a discipline, has evolved significantly over the past few decades, moving from a focus on neuroanatomy to a more dynamic understanding of cognitive functions and emotional processing. In parallel, William Blake's work, characterized by its visionary quality and profound philosophical underpinnings, offers fertile ground for examining the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic creation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries, proposing a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that bridge neuroscience and art. The novelty lies in applying neuroscientific principles to interpret Blake’s work, revealing deeper connections between human cognition and artistic creation. By situating Blake within the context of contemporary neuroscience, we can uncover how his creative processes resonate with current understandings of the brain's functioning, thereby enriching both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of neuroscience enhance our understanding of Blake's artistic philosophy?
2. In what ways do cognitive processes manifest in Blake's poetry and visual art?
3. What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for education and artistic appreciation?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Development of Neuroscience

Neuroscience has undergone a remarkable transformation from its early roots in neuroanatomy, where the structures of the brain were mapped, to contemporary cognitive neuroscience, which emphasizes the interplay between neural mechanisms and cognitive functions. Key milestones in this evolution include the discovery of neurotransmitters, the development of neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, and the establishment of the field of neuropsychology, which examines the relationship between brain function and behavior.

#### Cultural Context of William Blake

William Blake (1757-1827) lived during a time of significant cultural upheaval, marked by the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism, emotion, and the sublime. Blake's work, both literary and visual, reflects the philosophical underpinnings of this era, characterized by a deep engagement with themes of spirituality, nature, and the human condition. His unique blend of poetry and visual art serves as a testament to the interconnectedness of these domains, making him a compelling subject for interdisciplinary exploration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience and Creativity

Recent research in neuroscience has illuminated various aspects of creativity, including the cognitive processes involved in ideation, the role of emotional engagement in artistic expression, and the neural correlates of creative thinking. Studies have shown that creativity is not confined to a single brain region but involves a network of areas, including the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for higher-order thinking, and the limbic system, which governs emotional responses.

#### Scholarship on Blake's Work

Existing scholarship on Blake has primarily focused on thematic interpretations, stylistic analysis, and the historical context of his work. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects Blake’s artistic output with cognitive neuroscience. This gap presents an opportunity for new insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of his work.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of neuroscience and art remains underexplored, particularly in relation to how cognitive processes inform artistic creation. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by applying neuroscientific principles to the analysis of Blake's work, thereby offering novel insights into creativity and emotional engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscientific Theories

Key theories in neuroscience that will inform this research include:

- **Neural Networks**: These are interconnected groups of neurons that process information in the brain. Understanding how neural networks operate can shed light on the cognitive processes involved in artistic perception and creativity.
  
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: This refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience, a concept that parallels the evolution of Blake's artistic style throughout his life.

- **Neurotransmission**: The process by which signaling molecules are released by neurons and bind to receptors on other neurons, influencing mood, cognition, and emotional responses.

#### Blake’s Philosophical Beliefs

Blake’s work is deeply rooted in his philosophical beliefs, which emphasize the importance of imagination, the interconnectedness of all life, and the duality of human experience. His views on creativity as a divine force align with contemporary understandings of the cognitive processes that underpin artistic expression.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes the development of integrated constructs, such as:

- **Neural Imagery**: A concept that explores the relationship between cognitive imagery and artistic representation, examining how neural mechanisms influence the creation and interpretation of visual art.

- **Creative Neurotransmission**: This construct focuses on the emotional and cognitive processes involved in artistic creation, drawing parallels between neurotransmitter activity and the emotional resonance of Blake's work.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be presented, illustrating the interactions between cognitive processes, emotional engagement, and artistic expression. This model will serve as a framework for analyzing Blake’s work through the lens of neuroscience, facilitating a deeper understanding of the cognitive and emotional dimensions of his artistry.

## Methodology

This dissertation will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of Blake’s works with quantitative neuroscientific research. This integrative design will allow for a comprehensive exploration of the cognitive and emotional processes underlying Blake's artistic expression.

### Data Collection Methods

#### Textual Analysis

A thorough textual analysis of Blake’s poetry and visual art will be conducted, focusing on themes, imagery, and stylistic elements that exemplify his artistic philosophy.

#### Neuroimaging Studies

Neuroimaging studies, including fMRI, will be utilized to assess brain activity in response to Blake’s works. Participants will engage with selected poems and artworks, providing insights into the neural correlates of cognitive engagement and emotional response.

### Analytical Approaches

#### Thematic Analysis

A thematic analysis will be employed to identify key motifs and patterns within Blake's texts and images, allowing for a deeper understanding of his artistic intentions.

#### Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis of neuroimaging data will be conducted to identify correlations between cognitive engagement and emotional responses, providing empirical support for the proposed theoretical constructs.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount in this research, particularly concerning human subject research in neuroimaging. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring that their rights and well-being are prioritized. Additionally, the interpretation of Blake's work will be approached with respect and sensitivity, acknowledging the historical and cultural contexts in which it was created.
