## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The development of neural networks in cognitive science has its roots in early attempts to model human cognition through artificial intelligence. Pioneering work by researchers such as McCulloch and Pitts (1943) laid the groundwork for understanding how simple neural units could simulate complex cognitive processes. Over the decades, advancements in computational power and algorithmic sophistication have led to the creation of deep learning models that can recognize patterns, make predictions, and even generate creative content.

In parallel, William Blake's life and artistic philosophy emerged during a tumultuous period in British history, marked by the Industrial Revolution and the Enlightenment. Blake's work reflects a profound engagement with the socio-political issues of his time, as well as a deep exploration of spiritual and metaphysical themes. His poetry and visual art grapple with the dualities of existence—such as innocence and experience, good and evil, and the material and spiritual. Understanding these dualities is crucial for appreciating the complexity of Blake's artistic vision.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Existing research in neural networks has primarily focused on their applications in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and cognitive modeling. Theoretical advancements have also been made in understanding synaptic plasticity—the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time, which is fundamental to learning and memory. These concepts can be applied to literary analysis by considering how themes evolve and interact within a text.

In literary criticism, Blake's themes have been analyzed through various lenses, including Romanticism, psychoanalysis, and post-colonial studies. Scholars have explored the interplay of innocence and experience in his work, as well as his critique of societal norms. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines insights from neuroscience with literary analysis, particularly in the context of Blake's complex thematic structures.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of neuroscience and literature presents significant opportunities for new insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic engagement. The existing gap in interdisciplinary research highlights the potential for developing innovative frameworks that can deepen our understanding of both fields. By examining Blake's work through the lens of neural networks, this dissertation aims to uncover the underlying cognitive processes that inform artistic creation and appreciation.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key concepts in neural networks, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations, serve as foundational theories for this research. Synaptic plasticity refers to the ability of synapses to change their strength based on activity, which is crucial for learning and memory. This concept can be applied to Blake's themes, suggesting that they are not static but evolve over time in response to various influences.

Neural oscillations, or rhythmic patterns of neural activity, are also relevant to understanding Blake's poetic structure. These oscillations can influence cognitive processes such as attention, perception, and emotional engagement. By examining how these concepts relate to Blake's work, this dissertation seeks to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates neuroscience with literary analysis.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research introduces the concept of thematic neurons—representing central themes in Blake's work—and synapses—illustrating the connections between these themes. This framework allows for a dynamic understanding of Blake's themes as interconnected elements within a neural network. Additionally, the concept of cognitive resonance is proposed as a measure of emotional and intellectual engagement, reflecting how readers interact with Blake's work on both cognitive and affective levels.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model depicts Blake's themes as a dynamic neural network, illustrating their interconnections and influences. This model serves as a visual representation of how themes interact, evolve, and resonate with readers, providing a foundation for the subsequent analysis of Blake's work.
