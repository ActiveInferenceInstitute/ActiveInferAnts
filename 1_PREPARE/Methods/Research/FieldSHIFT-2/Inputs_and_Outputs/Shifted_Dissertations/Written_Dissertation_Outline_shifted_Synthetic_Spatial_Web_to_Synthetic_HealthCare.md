## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Spatial Web

The evolution of the Spatial Web can be traced from early digital interfaces to the current immersive environments that characterize modern technology. Initially, the digital landscape was primarily two-dimensional, limited to static websites and basic user interactions. With advancements in computing power and internet connectivity, the emergence of 3D graphics and interactive simulations paved the way for more immersive experiences. The introduction of AR and VR technologies has further propelled this evolution, allowing users to interact with digital content in a spatial context.

#### Health Care

The historical progression of health care practices has shifted from a paternalistic model to a more patient-centered approach. The traditional model emphasized physician authority and patient compliance, often neglecting the individual needs and preferences of patients. However, the rise of patient-centered care models has highlighted the importance of patient engagement and shared decision-making. This shift has been influenced by advancements in technology, which have enabled more personalized and interactive health care experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The current landscape of the Spatial Web is characterized by rapid technological advancements, with AR and VR being utilized in various domains, including gaming, education, and training. In health care, these technologies have begun to find applications in medical training, patient education, and therapeutic interventions. However, the integration of these technologies into routine health care practices remains limited.

In health care, existing technologies such as telemedicine, electronic health records (EHRs), and mobile health applications have improved access to care and patient engagement. Yet, challenges such as fragmented care delivery and inadequate patient education persist. The convergence of Spatial Web technologies with health care practices presents an opportunity to address these challenges and enhance patient experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the potential of Spatial Web technologies, there is a notable lack of integration between these innovations and existing health care practices. This gap presents a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing for the development of new methodologies that enhance patient experiences and outcomes. By leveraging the immersive capabilities of AR and VR, health care providers can create more engaging educational materials, while IoT devices can facilitate real-time monitoring of patient health.
