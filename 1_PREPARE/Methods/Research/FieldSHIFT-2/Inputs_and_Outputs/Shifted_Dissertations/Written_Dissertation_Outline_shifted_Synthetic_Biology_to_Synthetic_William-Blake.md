## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Ecological Principles and Their Historical Development

Ecology, as a scientific discipline, has evolved significantly since its inception in the late 19th century. Early ecological studies focused primarily on the relationships between organisms and their environments, with pioneers like Ernst Haeckel coining the term "ecology" in 1866. Over the decades, ecological research has expanded to encompass complex systems theory, resilience theory, and the study of biodiversity. The recognition of ecosystems as dynamic, interconnected networks has profound implications for understanding both natural environments and human societies.

#### Examination of Key Themes in Blake’s Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) occupies a unique position in the literary canon, renowned for his visionary poetry and striking visual art. His work often grapples with themes of innocence versus experience, spirituality, and societal critique. Blake's poetry reflects a deep engagement with the natural world, as seen in his depictions of pastoral landscapes and the personification of nature. His exploration of dualities—such as the tension between the material and spiritual realms—resonates with contemporary ecological discussions about the relationship between humanity and the environment.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Review of Contemporary Ecological Literature and Its Relevance to the Humanities

Recent scholarship in ecology emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, particularly in addressing contemporary environmental challenges. Works by authors such as Timothy Morton and Donna Haraway advocate for a more integrated understanding of ecology that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Their emphasis on the interconnectedness of all life forms aligns with Blake's own thematic preoccupations, suggesting fruitful avenues for exploration within literary studies.

#### Analysis of Existing Blake Scholarship and the Limitations of Traditional Literary Frameworks

Traditional Blake scholarship has often focused on his religious and philosophical ideas, with less attention paid to the ecological dimensions of his work. While critics have explored Blake's critique of industrialization and his visionary aesthetics, there remains a paucity of research that systematically applies ecological frameworks to his poetry and art. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by introducing ecological principles as essential tools for understanding Blake's complex thematic interrelations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

#### Identification of Gaps in the Intersection of Ecology and Literature

Despite the growing interest in ecocriticism and the environmental humanities, there remains a limited exploration of how specific literary figures, such as Blake, can be analyzed through ecological lenses. The existing scholarship often treats ecology as a backdrop rather than a central analytical framework. This oversight presents a significant opportunity for interdisciplinary research that combines ecological dynamics with literary analysis.

#### Exploration of Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Research

This research aims to open new avenues for interdisciplinary scholarship, encouraging collaboration between literary scholars, ecologists, and artists. By situating Blake's work within the context of ecosystem dynamics, this dissertation aspires to foster innovative research methodologies that can be applied to other literary figures and movements, thereby enriching both ecological and literary studies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Overview of Key Ecological Theories

Key ecological theories relevant to this research include systems theory and resilience theory. Systems theory posits that ecosystems function as interconnected wholes, where the relationships between components are as important as the components themselves. Resilience theory focuses on the capacity of ecosystems to absorb disturbances and reorganize while undergoing change. These theories provide a robust framework for analyzing the interconnected themes and characters in Blake's work.

#### Discussion of Literary Theories Relevant to Blake

Blake's work can be situated within the context of Romanticism, characterized by its emphasis on nature, emotion, and individualism. Additionally, post-structuralist theories, which challenge fixed meanings and emphasize the fluidity of interpretation, resonate with Blake's own subversion of traditional narratives. These literary theories will serve as a foundation for the interdisciplinary analysis proposed in this dissertation.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Introduction of the Concept of "Ecosystem of Ideas"

The concept of "ecosystem of ideas" will be introduced as a framework for analyzing Blake's work. This construct posits that Blake's themes, motifs, and stylistic choices function as interconnected components within a broader literary ecosystem. By examining the interplay between these elements, this research aims to illuminate the complexity and richness of Blake's oeuvre.

#### Development of "Trophic Cascades of Influence"

The notion of "trophic cascades of influence" will be developed to describe the impact of key texts on subsequent literary movements. Just as trophic cascades in ecology illustrate how changes at one level of a food web can affect multiple levels, this concept will explore how Blake's work has influenced later writers and artistic movements, creating a ripple effect throughout literary history.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines ecological dynamics with literary analysis. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of themes, the resilience of characters, and the biodiversity of ideas within Blake's work.
