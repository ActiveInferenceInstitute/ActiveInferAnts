# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Biological Ecosystems onto William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of biological ecosystems and the life and work of William Blake, creating a novel framework for understanding the interconnectedness of art, nature, and society. By analyzing Blake's contributions through the lens of ecological principles, this research aims to illuminate the dynamics of artistic communities as ecosystems, emphasizing themes of interdependence, energy flow, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and resilience. The study will not only expand the discourse surrounding Blake's work but will also offer practical applications for art education, interdisciplinary collaborations, and societal transformation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of biology and ecosystems with the study of William Blake's art and poetry presents a unique opportunity to re-evaluate both fields. Ecosystems, defined by complex interactions among organisms and their environments, serve as a metaphor for understanding the dynamics of artistic communities. Blakeâ€™s work reflects a deep interconnectedness and social critique, which can be understood through the principles of ecology. This dissertation will explore how ecological principles can provide insights into Blake's artistic community and his creative processes, ultimately revealing the intricate relationships between art, nature, and society.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally separate domains, offering a fresh perspective on Blake's contributions and the role of art in society. By applying ecological principles to Blake's work, the dissertation aims to uncover new meanings and implications, contributing to the fields of art history, ecology, and cultural studies. The novelty lies in the development of an "Artistic Ecosystem Theory" that redefines artistic communities as dynamic, interdependent systems, thereby enriching our understanding of both Blake's oeuvre and contemporary artistic practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation will address the following questions:

- How can ecological principles be applied to understand the dynamics of artistic communities?
- In what ways do Blake's works reflect the characteristics of biological ecosystems?
- What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for contemporary art practice and education?

The objectives of the research include:

1. To analyze the interdependence within Blake's artistic community.
2. To investigate the flow of creative energy and ideas in Blake's work.
3. To examine the nutrient cycling of themes and motifs in Blake's art and their reinterpretation in contemporary practices.
4. To explore the biodiversity of expression in Blake's oeuvre and its significance for cultural richness.
5. To assess the resilience of artistic communities through innovation and adaptation.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Biology and Ecosystems

Ecological theories have evolved significantly since the time of Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection laid the groundwork for understanding interdependence among species. Key figures such as Eugene Odum and Aldo Leopold further developed concepts of energy flow and nutrient cycling, emphasizing the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem health. Odum's holistic approach to ecology illustrated how systems function as interconnected networks, while Leopold's land ethic underscored the moral responsibility of humans to care for the environment.

#### William Blake's Life and Work

William Blake (1757-1827) was a visionary poet and artist whose work is characterized by a profound exploration of interconnectedness and social critique. His unique artistic philosophy, which combined poetry, painting, and printmaking, reflects a deep engagement with the spiritual and material worlds. Major works such as "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," and his prophetic books reveal Blake's concern for the human condition, the environment, and the transformative power of imagination. This section will delve into Blake's biography, examining the influences that shaped his artistic vision and the recurring themes of interconnectedness and social justice in his work.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Biological Ecosystems

Recent advancements in ecology have highlighted the impacts of climate change, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss on ecosystems. Research into ecosystem services has underscored the importance of maintaining healthy ecosystems for human well-being. Scholars have focused on the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address environmental challenges, emphasizing the value of collaboration between scientists, policymakers, and communities.

#### Blake Studies

Current interpretations of Blake's work have expanded to include feminist, post-colonial, and psychoanalytic approaches. Scholars have examined the ways in which Blake's art engages with issues of power, identity, and the human psyche. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that integrates ecological principles with literary and artistic analysis, presenting an opportunity for innovative scholarship.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The identified gaps in interdisciplinary research highlight the need for a comprehensive framework that integrates ecological principles with artistic analysis. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring the connections between Blake's work and ecological concepts, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Ecological Theories

Key ecological concepts such as resilience, biodiversity, and energy flow provide a foundational framework for understanding the dynamics of artistic communities. Resilience refers to the ability of an ecosystem to adapt and recover from disturbances, while biodiversity encompasses the variety of life forms within a given environment. Energy flow describes the transfer of energy through food webs, analogous to the circulation of ideas and influences within artistic communities.

#### Artistic Theories

Artistic theories related to interconnectedness emphasize the role of the artist as a mediator between society and nature. Theories of relational aesthetics and participatory art underscore the importance of collaboration and community engagement in the creative process. These theories align with ecological principles, suggesting that artistic communities function similarly to biological ecosystems.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The development of an "Artistic Ecosystem Theory" posits that artistic communities are living systems characterized by unique dynamics influenced by ecological principles. This theory emphasizes the interdependence of artists, the flow of creative energy, the cycling of ideas, and the diversity of expression within artistic environments.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual model illustrating the interplay between ecological principles and artistic expression will be developed. This model will highlight key components such as collaboration, competition, and innovation, demonstrating how these elements contribute to the overall health and vitality of artistic communities.
