## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Logistics

The evolution of logistics can be traced from traditional supply chain management practices to modern methodologies that emphasize real-time tracking, sustainability initiatives, and customer-centric approaches. Early logistics focused primarily on the physical movement of goods, but with advancements in technology, it has transformed into a complex network of processes that prioritize efficiency and responsiveness. Key developments such as the introduction of just-in-time inventory systems, automated warehousing, and sophisticated data analytics have significantly enhanced logistical operations.

#### ATM Transactions

The history of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) dates back to the late 1960s, with the first machine introduced in London. Initially designed to dispense cash, ATMs have evolved to offer a wide range of banking services, including deposits, transfers, and account management. The development of user-friendly interfaces, enhanced security measures, and mobile integration has further transformed the ATM landscape, making it a critical component of modern banking.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent studies in logistics have focused on various aspects, including efficiency optimization, risk management, and customer-centric approaches. Researchers have explored the impact of technology on logistics operations, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making and real-time visibility. In the realm of ATM transactions, contemporary research has examined security protocols, transaction flows, and accessibility issues, highlighting the need for continuous innovation to meet evolving consumer demands.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that bridges logistics and ATM transactions. The lack of studies exploring how logistics principles can enhance ATM operations presents a significant opportunity for innovation. By addressing this gap, this dissertation aims to contribute to the academic literature and provide actionable insights for practitioners in the banking and logistics sectors.
