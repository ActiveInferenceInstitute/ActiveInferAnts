## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Biology

An overview of key principles and theories in biology reveals foundational concepts such as ecosystem dynamics, population dynamics, and organismal adaptation. Ecosystem dynamics emphasize the interdependence of species and their environments, while population dynamics focus on the changes in species populations over time. Organismal adaptation highlights the capacity of living beings to adjust to environmental changes, a principle that can be paralleled in cultural practices as societies evolve.

#### Non-Science Ways of Knowing

Exploration of traditional knowledge systems, narrative practices, and holistic approaches to understanding human experience illustrates the richness of non-scientific epistemologies. Indigenous knowledge systems, for example, emphasize a deep connection to the land and community, often integrating spiritual beliefs with ecological understanding. Narrative practices, such as storytelling, serve as a means of transmitting cultural values and collective memory, thereby fostering community cohesion and identity.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

A summary of existing research on biological principles and their applications in social sciences and humanities reveals a growing interest in interdisciplinary studies. Scholars have begun to explore how ecological concepts can inform social theory, particularly in areas such as environmental sociology and cultural anthropology. Conversely, current paradigms in non-science ways of knowing highlight the challenges of integrating subjective knowledge with empirical data, often leading to a dichotomy between the two domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identification of gaps in literature regarding the intersection of biology and cultural studies underscores the need for further exploration. While there are isolated studies that touch upon these themes, a comprehensive framework for understanding their interplay remains largely underdeveloped. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by presenting emerging opportunities for research that can bridge these domains, fostering a more integrated approach to understanding human dynamics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Biological Theories

Key biological theories such as ecosystem theory, resilience theory, and biodiversity theory provide a foundation for transposing concepts into cultural contexts. Ecosystem theory emphasizes the relationships and interactions between organisms and their environments, while resilience theory focuses on the capacity of systems to absorb disturbances and maintain functionality. Biodiversity theory highlights the importance of diversity within ecosystems, which can be paralleled in cultural contexts where diversity enhances community strength and adaptability.

#### Cultural Theories

Cultural theories such as social constructivism, narrative theory, and holistic epistemologies offer insights into how knowledge is constructed and understood. Social constructivism posits that knowledge is created through social interactions, while narrative theory emphasizes the role of storytelling in shaping cultural identity. Holistic epistemologies advocate for an integrated understanding of knowledge that encompasses both scientific and non-scientific perspectives.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The development of concepts such as "Cultural Ecosystem" and "Narrative Ecology" facilitates the transposition of biological principles into cultural contexts. A "Cultural Ecosystem" embodies the idea that cultures, much like biological ecosystems, are composed of interconnected practices, beliefs, and values that evolve over time. "Narrative Ecology" explores how stories and narratives function as ecological systems, influencing individual and collective identities within cultural landscapes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual and conceptual model illustrating the interconnectedness of biological and cultural dynamics will be presented. This model emphasizes adaptability, diversity, and resilience as key components that can enhance our understanding of both biological and cultural systems. The integration of these concepts aims to foster a more holistic approach to analyzing human behavior and societal trends.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research designs. The integration of empirical observation, case studies, and narrative analysis allows for a comprehensive exploration of the transposition of biological concepts into cultural contexts.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection will involve surveys and interviews with cultural practitioners and community members, providing insights into their experiences and perspectives. Additionally, field studies will observe cultural practices and their ecological contexts, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interplay between biology and culture.

### Analytical Approaches

Thematic analysis will be employed to analyze qualitative data, identifying key themes and patterns that emerge from the narratives of participants. Statistical modeling will be used to explore relationships between cultural diversity and community resilience, providing empirical support for the theoretical constructs developed in this dissertation.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the research process. Ensuring informed consent and respect for cultural practices is essential, particularly when engaging with marginalized communities. Addressing potential biases in interpreting non-scientific knowledge systems will also be a critical focus, promoting a respectful and equitable research process.

## Core Chapters

### Key Aspect 1: Ecosystem Dynamics to Cultural Dynamics

#### Sub-section 1: Conceptualizing Cultures as Ecosystems

This section will explore cultural interactions and their implications for community health. By conceptualizing cultures as ecosystems, we can analyze how cultural practices, beliefs, and values interact and influence one another. The health of a cultural ecosystem can be assessed through the diversity of practices, the adaptability of cultural narratives, and the resilience of communities in the face of change.

#### Sub-section 2: Keystone Cultural Practices

Identification and analysis of cultural practices that significantly influence community resilience will be conducted. Keystone cultural practices, much like keystone species in ecology, play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of cultural ecosystems. Understanding these practices can inform strategies for enhancing community resilience and sustainability.

### Key Aspect 2: Population Dynamics to Social Dynamics

#### Sub-section 1: Growth and Decline of Ideas

This section will examine how cultural movements evolve and the factors that contribute to their success or failure. Drawing parallels to population dynamics in biology, we will explore concepts such as cultural proliferation, adaptation, and extinction, providing insights into the life cycles of cultural ideas.
