## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

The concept of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially, it emerged from the fields of decision science and behavioral economics, with key thinkers such as Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky laying the groundwork for understanding human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty. Methodologies within PME include scenario planning, probabilistic forecasting, and the utilization of big data analytics to derive actionable insights. These methodologies emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge and the synthesis of diverse data sources to make informed predictions.

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive Security has its roots in the study of information warfare and psychological operations. It encompasses a wide range of concepts aimed at protecting cognitive processes from external manipulations, particularly misinformation and cognitive biases. Major contributions to this field have come from scholars such as Bruce Schneier, who highlighted the vulnerabilities of human cognition in the face of digital threats. Current paradigms in Cognitive Security focus on the interplay between technology and human cognition, exploring both technological solutions (such as AI algorithms) and human-centered approaches (such as education and awareness campaigns).

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary research in PME has expanded to include advanced data analytics, machine learning techniques, and cognitive flexibility assessments. These studies underscore the importance of understanding social dynamics and the behavioral underpinnings of decision-making processes in predicting outcomes.

In the realm of Cognitive Security, the focus has shifted towards understanding the mechanisms of misinformation dissemination, cognitive biases, and the effectiveness of various interventions. Researchers are increasingly examining both technological and human-centered solutions, including the role of social media platforms in perpetuating misinformation and strategies for enhancing public awareness and critical thinking skills.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both PME and Cognitive Security, a notable gap exists in the literature concerning interdisciplinary approaches. Current cognitive security literature often fails to incorporate predictive models that account for cognitive biases and social dynamics. This presents an opportunity for researchers to explore how the integration of PME principles can lead to the development of more effective cognitive security frameworks, ultimately enhancing cognitive resilience in the face of misinformation and cognitive threats.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The intersection of PME and Cognitive Security necessitates a comprehensive theoretical framework that draws from foundational theories in both fields. Key theories of prediction and decision-making from PME, such as the Bayesian approach to probability and the heuristics and biases framework, provide essential insights into how individuals process information and make predictions.

In Cognitive Security, cognitive theories related to misinformation, such as the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Inoculation Theory, highlight the mechanisms through which individuals are influenced by persuasive messages and how they can be "inoculated" against misinformation through preemptive strategies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

In light of the integration of PME and Cognitive Security, new theoretical constructs are emerging. This dissertation proposes the development of an integrated theoretical model that combines predictive analytics with cognitive resilience strategies. This model posits that effective cognitive security measures must not only address the immediate cognitive threats posed by misinformation but also incorporate predictive capabilities that anticipate the spread and impact of such threats.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interaction between PME principles and cognitive security strategies. It emphasizes a cyclical relationship where predictive analytics inform cognitive security measures, which in turn enhance the predictive capabilities of PME. This model serves as a foundation for developing practical applications and strategies within the Shifted Domain.
