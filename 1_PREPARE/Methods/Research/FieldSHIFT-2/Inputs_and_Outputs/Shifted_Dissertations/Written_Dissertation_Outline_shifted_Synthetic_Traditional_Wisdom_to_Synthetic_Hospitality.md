By systematically transposing the principles of TK into GE, this research will uncover innovative frameworks that enhance guest satisfaction, promote sustainability, and preserve cultural heritage. The significance of this study lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging indigenous wisdom with contemporary hospitality practices, thereby creating a new paradigm that resonates with modern travelers' expectations. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and community engagement.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Guest Experience represents a significant shift in the hospitality landscape. Traditional Knowledge embodies the wisdom, practices, and cultural heritage of indigenous and local communities, while Guest Experience focuses on the holistic interactions guests have with hospitality establishments. This dissertation will examine how these two domains can inform and enhance each other. The integration of TK into GE not only enriches the guest experience but also provides a framework for sustainable practices that respect and preserve cultural identities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its approach to integrating TK into GE, addressing the growing demand for authentic and meaningful travel experiences. In an era where travelers seek deeper connections with the places they visit, leveraging traditional practices enables hospitality businesses to differentiate themselves in a competitive market. Furthermore, this integration contributes to sustainability and cultural preservation, allowing communities to retain ownership of their heritage while benefiting economically from tourism.

2. **What are the impacts of this integration on guest satisfaction and sustainability?**
3. **What frameworks can be developed to guide hospitality practitioners in implementing these practices?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Traditional Knowledge

Traditional Knowledge refers to the cumulative body of knowledge, practices, and beliefs held by indigenous and local communities. It encompasses a variety of domains, including agriculture, medicine, and environmental stewardship. Historically, TK has been passed down through generations, forming the backbone of cultural identity and community resilience. Its significance has been recognized in various international frameworks, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

#### Evolution of Guest Experience

The concept of Guest Experience has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially focused on service quality and customer satisfaction, the paradigm has shifted towards a holistic understanding of the guest's journey. Emerging trends emphasize personalization, emotional engagement, and sustainability. The rise of experiential travel has further transformed how hospitality businesses approach guest interactions, necessitating a deeper understanding of cultural contexts.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Traditional Knowledge Applications

Existing research on TK highlights its applications in various sectors, including agriculture, health, and environmental management. However, its integration into the hospitality industry remains underexplored. Studies indicate that TK can enhance sustainability practices, offering insights into local ecosystems and resource management.

#### Guest Experience Literature

The literature on Guest Experience emphasizes the importance of personalization, cultural engagement, and sustainability. Recent studies demonstrate that guests increasingly value authentic experiences that reflect local culture and heritage. However, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks that guide the integration of TK into GE.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identifying gaps in current research reveals significant opportunities for innovation within the hospitality industry. The intersection of TK and GE presents a unique opportunity to develop frameworks that enhance guest satisfaction while promoting sustainability and cultural preservation. This research aims to fill these gaps by providing a structured approach to integrating TK into GE.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Traditional Knowledge Theories

Key theories from TK include ecological sustainability, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of cultural practices and environmental health, and cultural identity, which highlights the role of traditional practices in shaping community identity. These theories provide a foundation for understanding how TK can inform sustainable practices in hospitality.

#### Guest Experience Theories

Theories from GE include service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL model, which assesses guest expectations and perceptions, and experiential marketing, which focuses on creating memorable experiences. These theories underscore the importance of emotional engagement and personalization in enhancing guest satisfaction.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Cultural Co-Creation Model

The Cultural Co-Creation Model posits that guests and hosts can collaboratively create meaningful experiences that reflect local culture. This model emphasizes the role of storytelling, cultural immersion, and shared experiences in enhancing guest engagement.

#### Sustainable Experience Framework

The Sustainable Experience Framework guides hospitality businesses in implementing eco-friendly practices that respect local cultures and environments. This framework encourages the incorporation of TK into sustainability initiatives, promoting a holistic approach to guest experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model combining elements from both domains will be presented, highlighting the interactions between TK and GE. This model will serve as a guide for hospitality practitioners seeking to enhance guest experiences through the integration of traditional practices.
