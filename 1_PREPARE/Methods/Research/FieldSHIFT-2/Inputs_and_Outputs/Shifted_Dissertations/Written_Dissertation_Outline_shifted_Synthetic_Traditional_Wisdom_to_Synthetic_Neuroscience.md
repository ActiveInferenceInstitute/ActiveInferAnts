## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Neuroscience represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding cognitive processes. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainability, holistic understanding, and cultural identity. For centuries, these communities have developed intricate systems of knowledge that address health, well-being, and environmental stewardship, often rooted in a deep understanding of the interconnections between nature, culture, and human cognition.

Neuroscience, on the other hand, focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the brain and its functions, employing reductionist methodologies to dissect the complexities of neural processes. While traditional neuroscience has yielded significant insights into brain function, it often overlooks the cultural and ecological contexts that shape cognitive processes. By transposing principles of TK into the neuroscience framework, we can explore the interconnectedness of ecological health, cultural practices, and cognitive function, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and mental health.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges the reductionist paradigms prevalent in neuroscience by introducing holistic perspectives derived from TK. The novelty lies in the development of integrated theoretical models that bridge these two domains, offering fresh insights into neuroplasticity, memory encoding, and community health. This dissertation will contribute to both academic knowledge and practical applications in mental health and education, positioning itself at the forefront of interdisciplinary research.

The integration of TK into neuroscience not only enriches our understanding of cognitive processes but also highlights the importance of cultural diversity in scientific inquiry. By acknowledging the value of indigenous wisdom and practices, this research advocates for a more inclusive approach to neuroscience that respects and incorporates diverse cultural perspectives.
