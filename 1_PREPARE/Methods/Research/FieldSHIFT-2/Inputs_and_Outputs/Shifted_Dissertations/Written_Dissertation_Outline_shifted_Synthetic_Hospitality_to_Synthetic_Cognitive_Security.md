## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Guest Experience

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the decades, with early hospitality models focusing primarily on service efficiency and product quality. However, the emergence of experiential marketing in the late 20th century shifted this focus toward creating memorable experiences that engage guests on emotional and psychological levels. Key principles such as personalization, anticipation of needs, and emotional connection have become central to guest experience strategies. Scholars like Pine and Gilmore (1999) have emphasized the importance of the "experience economy," where businesses must engage customers through memorable experiences rather than merely providing services.

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security, while a more recent field, has gained traction in response to the rapid proliferation of misinformation and the manipulation of cognitive processes. Originating from the domains of cybersecurity and psychology, cognitive security addresses the vulnerabilities of individuals and organizations to cognitive threats such as disinformation, propaganda, and social engineering. Historical challenges include the difficulty of quantifying cognitive threats and the need for interdisciplinary approaches to effectively combat them. As noted by scholars like Kahn et al. (2017), the cognitive security landscape is continually evolving, necessitating adaptive strategies that prioritize user engagement and education.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Guest Experience

Current trends in guest experience emphasize the integration of technology, such as AI and data analytics, to enhance personalization and customer satisfaction. Hospitality organizations are leveraging customer data to anticipate needs and tailor services, creating a more immersive experience. Additionally, the rise of social media has transformed how guests share their experiences, placing greater importance on online reputation management and real-time feedback mechanisms.

#### Cognitive Security

In the realm of cognitive security, existing frameworks focus on identifying and mitigating cognitive threats through education and awareness programs. However, there is a notable lack of emphasis on user experience and engagement, which are critical for fostering resilience. Current responses to misinformation often involve top-down approaches that may not resonate with users, leading to disengagement and skepticism. As a result, there is an urgent need to explore how guest experience principles can enhance cognitive security practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals significant gaps in cognitive security related to user engagement and personalization. Traditional approaches often overlook the importance of emotional and experiential dimensions in fostering resilience against cognitive threats. This dissertation identifies opportunities for integrating holistic approaches from hospitality to enhance cognitive security measures, suggesting that a focus on user experience can lead to more effective strategies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Service Quality Theory

Service quality theory, particularly the SERVQUAL model, provides a valuable lens for assessing cognitive security interactions. This model emphasizes the importance of perceived service quality, which can be translated into the realm of cognitive security by evaluating how users perceive the quality of information and security measures. By applying SERVQUAL dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—to cognitive security, this research aims to create a framework for assessing user experiences.

#### Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive load theory offers insights into the cognitive processes involved in user interactions with information systems. This theory posits that individuals have a limited capacity for processing information, and excessive cognitive load can lead to errors and disengagement. Understanding cognitive load is crucial for designing cognitive security measures that are user-friendly and effective, ensuring that users can navigate information systems without becoming overwhelmed.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Cognitive Experience (CEx)

Cognitive Experience (CEx) is a new construct that encapsulates the user's journey through information systems, emphasizing emotional and psychological dimensions. CEx recognizes that users are not merely passive recipients of information; rather, they actively engage with and interpret information based on their experiences, emotions, and cognitive biases. This construct serves as the foundation for the proposed framework, guiding the development of personalized cognitive security solutions.

#### Personalization vs. Privacy Paradox

The personalization vs. privacy paradox explores the tension between the desire for tailored security measures and the need to protect user privacy. As organizations seek to enhance user experiences through personalization, they must navigate ethical considerations and privacy concerns. This theoretical exploration is vital for developing personalized cognitive security solutions that respect user autonomy while providing meaningful protection against cognitive threats.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interplay between guest experience principles and cognitive security frameworks. This model highlights key touchpoints and interactions, emphasizing the importance of user engagement, personalization, and information quality in enhancing cognitive security. By mapping these interactions, this research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how guest experience can inform cognitive security practices.
