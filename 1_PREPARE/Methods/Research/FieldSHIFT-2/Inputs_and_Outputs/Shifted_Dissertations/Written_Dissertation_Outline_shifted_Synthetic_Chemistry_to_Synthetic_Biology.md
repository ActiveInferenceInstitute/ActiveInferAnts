# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Chemistry

#### Development from Alchemy to Modern Chemistry

The evolution of chemistry as a scientific discipline can be traced back to the ancient practice of alchemy, which sought to transform base metals into gold and discover the elixir of life. This mystical approach laid the groundwork for modern chemistry, which emerged during the 17th century with the advent of the scientific method. Pioneering figures such as Robert Boyle and Antoine Lavoisier contributed significantly to the establishment of chemistry as a rigorous scientific field. Boyle's publication, "The Sceptical Chymist," challenged traditional alchemical beliefs and emphasized the importance of experimentation. Lavoisier's formulation of the law of conservation of mass and the identification of elements as fundamental building blocks of matter further solidified the foundations of modern chemistry.

#### Key Milestones

Significant discoveries and advancements in various fields of chemistry include the development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev, the formulation of atomic theory by John Dalton, and the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick. Each of these milestones has profoundly impacted our understanding of chemical interactions and has paved the way for subsequent discoveries in both chemistry and biology.
