## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Culinary Arts

The culinary arts have evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural exchanges, technological advancements, and changing societal preferences. From the development of basic cooking techniques to the rise of haute cuisine and molecular gastronomy, the evolution of cooking reflects a complex interplay of tradition, innovation, and sensory experience. Flavor profiles have been shaped by regional ingredients, cultural practices, and the creative expressions of chefs, making cuisine a rich field of study.

#### Introduction to the Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems, including the human brain, strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes and adaptive behaviors. By applying the FEP to culinary practices, we can explore how chefs predict sensory outcomes and adapt their techniques to optimize flavor experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Contemporary Culinary Trends

Contemporary culinary trends, including molecular gastronomy and fusion cuisine, illustrate the dynamic nature of cooking as an adaptive practice. Chefs increasingly experiment with unconventional ingredients and techniques, pushing the boundaries of traditional cooking. This evolution aligns with the principles of the Free Energy Principle, where innovation arises from the need to minimize discrepancies between expected and actual sensory experiences.

#### Review of Research on the Free Energy Principle

Research on the Free Energy Principle has expanded across various disciplines, including cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology. Studies have demonstrated how predictive coding influences perception and decision-making. However, there remains a gap in applying these concepts specifically to culinary practices, presenting an opportunity for innovative research that merges these fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of cognitive science principles into culinary practices presents significant gaps in the literature. While there is a growing body of work exploring culinary innovation, few studies have explicitly linked these practices to the theoretical constructs of the Free Energy Principle. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive framework that connects culinary arts with cognitive theories, leading to new insights and applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theories

Culinary theories encompass a range of concepts related to flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and the significance of seasonal ingredients. Understanding these theories is essential for analyzing how chefs create and refine culinary experiences. Flavor profiles are influenced by various factors, including ingredient combinations, cooking methods, and cultural contexts.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle is grounded in the idea that biological systems minimize free energy by constantly updating their internal models of the world. This involves making predictions about sensory input and adjusting behaviors to align with those predictions. Key concepts include free energy minimization, active inference, and predictive coding, all of which are relevant to understanding culinary practices.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Systems as Adaptive Systems

Culinary practices can be modeled as adaptive systems that respond to environmental changes and sensory feedback. This perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of cooking, where chefs continuously adjust their techniques and flavor profiles based on experiences and external influences. Understanding cooking as an adaptive process allows for a deeper exploration of how chefs innovate and refine their practices.

#### The Role of Sensory Feedback

Sensory feedback plays a crucial role in refining culinary practices and flavor experiences. Chefs rely on their sensory perceptions to evaluate the outcomes of their cooking, leading to iterative processes of experimentation and adaptation. This feedback loop aligns with the principles of predictive coding, where sensory predictions inform decision-making and technique development.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines culinary theories with the Free Energy Principle will be developed to illustrate the dynamic interplay between cooking techniques, flavor optimization, and cognitive processes. This model will serve as a foundation for exploring the research questions and objectives outlined in this dissertation, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding culinary practices as adaptive systems.
