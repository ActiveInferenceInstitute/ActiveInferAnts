## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Culinary Arts

The evolution of culinary practices is deeply intertwined with cultural significance and technological advancements. From ancient cooking methods to modern gastronomy, culinary arts have reflected societal changes, geographical influences, and technological innovations. The advent of the Industrial Revolution introduced mechanization into cooking, while the 20th century saw the rise of molecular gastronomy, emphasizing scientific principles in culinary practices. This historical context is crucial for understanding how chefs have navigated the complexities of flavor, texture, and presentation, often relying on intuition and experience rather than formalized cognitive frameworks.

#### Cognitive Science

Cognitive science has undergone significant evolution, particularly with the introduction of the Free Energy Principle, which posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding. This principle has been instrumental in understanding adaptive systems, emphasizing the role of predictions in shaping behavior. Active Inference extends this framework, suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environment to minimize prediction errors. These theories provide a robust foundation for exploring cognitive processes in culinary practices, where chefs continuously adapt their techniques based on sensory feedback.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in culinary technology, such as sous-vide cooking and flavor pairing algorithms, have transformed the culinary landscape, allowing for unprecedented creativity and precision. Concurrently, cognitive theories have advanced our understanding of how humans process information, make decisions, and adapt to new environments. Predictive coding has emerged as a critical framework for understanding behavior, yet its application in culinary contexts remains largely unexplored. This intersection presents a fertile ground for research, promising innovative insights into both culinary arts and cognitive science.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich histories of culinary arts and cognitive science, there exists a significant gap in interdisciplinary research connecting these fields. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring how culinary practices can inform cognitive theories and vice versa. The lack of existing literature on the application of cognitive principles in culinary contexts highlights an opportunity for innovation and exploration, paving the way for new theoretical constructs and practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theory

Culinary theory encompasses a range of concepts, including flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and the significance of mise en place. Flavor development is often guided by a chef's intuition and experience, but it can also be understood through cognitive frameworks. The concept of mise en place, which emphasizes the importance of preparation and organization, parallels cognitive principles of predictive processing, where effective planning leads to more efficient outcomes.

#### Cognitive Theory

The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference are foundational theories in cognitive science. The Free Energy Principle posits that organisms minimize surprise by maintaining a model of the world that predicts sensory input. Active Inference extends this idea, suggesting that organisms not only update their beliefs based on incoming data but also actively seek information to reduce uncertainty. These theories provide a robust framework for understanding how chefs navigate the complexities of cooking, making decisions based on predictions and feedback.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

From the intersection of culinary arts and cognitive science, new theoretical constructs such as Culinary Predictive Models and Active Culinary Inference emerge. Culinary Predictive Models encompass the mental frameworks chefs use to anticipate flavors and textures, while Active Culinary Inference refers to the dynamic process of adjusting cooking techniques based on sensory feedback. These constructs offer a novel perspective on culinary practices, emphasizing the cognitive processes that underpin creativity and adaptation in cooking.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that illustrates the relationships between culinary practices, cognitive processes, and predictive coding. This model will serve as a conceptual framework for understanding how chefs employ cognitive principles in their cooking, highlighting the interplay between prediction, feedback, and adaptation.
