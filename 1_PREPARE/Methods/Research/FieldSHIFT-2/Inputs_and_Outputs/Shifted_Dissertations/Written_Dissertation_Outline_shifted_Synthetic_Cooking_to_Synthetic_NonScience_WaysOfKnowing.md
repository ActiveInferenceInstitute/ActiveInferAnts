## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The literature on cuisine highlights its evolution through cultural exchange, migration, and technological advancements. Culinary practices have historically been shaped by geographical, social, and economic factors, leading to a rich tapestry of food traditions worldwide. For instance, the introduction of new ingredients through trade routes has resulted in the fusion of culinary styles, enriching local cuisines and reflecting broader cultural interactions.

Non-science ways of knowing have roots in indigenous practices and philosophical traditions, often marginalized in mainstream discourse. These methodologies emphasize holistic understanding, experiential learning, and the significance of personal narratives. The works of scholars such as Gregory Cajete and Linda Tuhiwai Smith underscore the importance of indigenous knowledge systems, which prioritize the interconnectedness of people, culture, and the environment. 

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in culinary studies emphasizes the cultural and social dimensions of food, examining how cuisine serves as a medium for identity construction and community cohesion. Scholars such as Sidney Mintz and Carole Counihan have explored the sociopolitical implications of food practices, revealing how culinary traditions are intertwined with issues of power, resistance, and cultural preservation.

Conversely, non-science ways of knowing are increasingly recognized for their holistic perspectives, challenging the dominance of scientific rationality. The works of educational theorists like David Kolb and John Dewey highlight the significance of experiential learning, advocating for an educational paradigm that values personal experience and reflection. However, there remains a gap in literature that directly connects these two domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of culinary arts with non-science knowledge systems presents opportunities to address complex global challenges, such as food security and cultural preservation. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that bridges these fields.
