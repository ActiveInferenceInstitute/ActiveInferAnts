## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Neural Networks

The historical development of neural networks can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the introduction of the perceptron by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. This early model laid the groundwork for future advancements in artificial intelligence by mimicking the way biological neurons communicate. Subsequent developments included the backpropagation algorithm, which allowed for the training of multi-layer networks, and the rise of deep learning in the 21st century, characterized by the use of complex architectures such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks. These advancements have led to significant applications in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

#### Evolution of Cognitive Security

Cognitive security, as a discipline, has evolved in response to the increasing prevalence of misinformation and cognitive biases that threaten decision-making processes. Historical milestones include the recognition of cognitive biases by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s, which highlighted the systematic errors in human judgment. In recent years, the rise of social media and digital communication has exacerbated these vulnerabilities, prompting the development of methodologies aimed at mitigating the effects of misinformation. Current cognitive security practices involve threat modeling, risk assessment, and the implementation of countermeasures to protect cognitive processes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Summary of Recent Advancements in Neural Networks

Recent advancements in neural networks have been marked by the proliferation of deep learning techniques, which utilize large datasets and powerful computational resources to train models that outperform traditional algorithms in various tasks. Insights from biological neural networks have informed the design of novel architectures, such as attention mechanisms and transformers, which have revolutionized natural language processing. Additionally, research into explainable AI has gained traction, addressing the need for transparency in neural network decision-making processes.

#### Analysis of Contemporary Cognitive Security Issues

Contemporary cognitive security issues are multifaceted, encompassing challenges related to misinformation dissemination, cognitive biases, and technological vulnerabilities. The rapid spread of false information on social media platforms has raised concerns about its impact on public opinion and democratic processes. Furthermore, cognitive biases such as confirmation bias and the Dunning-Kruger effect hinder individuals' ability to critically evaluate information, leading to poor decision-making. Current methodologies focus on enhancing media literacy, promoting critical thinking, and developing technological solutions to detect and counter misinformation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both neural networks and cognitive security, significant gaps remain in the application of neural network principles to cognitive security frameworks. There is a lack of interdisciplinary research that explores how adaptive mechanisms from neural networks can enhance cognitive resilience. This dissertation seeks to identify these gaps and explore the opportunities for innovative research that can bridge the divide between computational models and cognitive processes.
