## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, driven by increasing consumer demands for personalized service, operational efficiency, and enhanced security. Concurrently, the banking sector has successfully implemented self-service technologies through ATMs, which empower users to conduct transactions independently and with ease. The integration of these two domains presents an opportunity to leverage the successful principles of ATM transactions to enhance the guest experience in hospitality settings.

ATMs have revolutionized banking by providing customers with the ability to perform a variety of financial transactions without the need for direct interaction with bank personnel. This self-service model has not only improved efficiency but has also allowed banks to allocate human resources to more complex customer service needs. Similarly, the hospitality sector can benefit from adopting self-service technologies that allow guests to manage their experiences independently, thereby enhancing satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between two traditionally distinct fields: banking and hospitality. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ATM principles to hospitality, offering a fresh perspective on service delivery that prioritizes guest autonomy, efficiency, and security. By addressing the challenges faced by both sectors, this study aims to create a new paradigm for guest interaction and operational excellence.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they offer practical applications that can significantly enhance the guest experience. The findings will provide industry practitioners with actionable insights into how to implement self-service technologies effectively, ensuring that they align with guest expectations and operational goals.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can self-service technologies from the ATM domain be effectively integrated into the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What structured interaction flows can enhance operational efficiency and guest satisfaction?
3. How do enhanced security protocols influence guest trust and loyalty in hospitality settings?
4. What are the implications of this integration for training, technology adoption, and service design in the hospitality industry?

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Self-Service Technology (SST) Theory

Self-Service Technology (SST) Theory posits that users derive satisfaction from self-service options when they are designed effectively. This theory emphasizes the importance of user behavior, perceived ease of use, and the overall satisfaction derived from self-service interactions. In the context of hospitality, understanding these dynamics is crucial for implementing self-service technologies that enhance the guest experience.

#### Service Quality Models

Service quality models, such as the SERVQUAL model, examine the dimensions of service quality that influence customer satisfaction. These dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—are essential for evaluating the guest experience in hospitality and can be informed by the principles of self-service technologies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### ATM Model of Guest Experience

The ATM Model of Guest Experience is a proposed framework that seeks to understand how ATM principles can enhance hospitality services. This model focuses on the integration of self-service technologies, structured interaction flows, and enhanced security measures to create a seamless, efficient, and satisfying guest experience.

#### Self-Service Satisfaction Theory

Self-Service Satisfaction Theory posits that self-service options improve guest satisfaction when designed effectively. This theory highlights the importance of user-centric design, providing guests with the autonomy to manage their experiences while ensuring that the technology is intuitive and accessible.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines ATM transaction principles with hospitality service design, focusing on user experience, security, and feedback. This model serves as a foundation for understanding how the integration of self-service technologies can enhance operational efficiency and guest satisfaction while addressing contemporary challenges in the hospitality industry.
