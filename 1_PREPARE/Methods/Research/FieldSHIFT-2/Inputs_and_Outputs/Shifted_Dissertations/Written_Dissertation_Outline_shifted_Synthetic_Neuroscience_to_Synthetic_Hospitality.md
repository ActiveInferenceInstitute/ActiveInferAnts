## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has historically prioritized service quality and operational efficiency, focusing on tangible metrics such as speed of service, cleanliness, and staff professionalism. However, the emergence of neuroscience as a field offers a fresh perspective on understanding guest behavior, preferences, and emotional responses. Neuroscience, the study of the nervous system and brain function, provides insights into the neural mechanisms that drive human interactions and decision-making processes. This dissertation will explore how these neural mechanisms can be harnessed to enhance guest experiences, thereby creating a more profound connection between service providers and customers.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it represents a pioneering approach to enhancing guest experiences through the application of neuroscience principles. By bridging the gap between two distinct fields—neuroscience and hospitality management—this study will fill existing voids in hospitality research while providing actionable insights for industry practitioners. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary nature, offering a unique perspective that has the potential to reshape traditional hospitality paradigms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

This dissertation is guided by three primary research questions:

1. How can principles from neuroscience be applied to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of emotional engagement on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can hospitality businesses adapt their service recovery strategies based on neuroscience insights?

The objectives of this research include:

- To identify and analyze the neural mechanisms that influence guest behavior.
- To develop metrics for measuring emotional engagement in hospitality settings.
- To propose a framework that integrates neuroscience principles into service design and delivery.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved significantly since its inception, moving from basic anatomical studies of the brain to sophisticated imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). These advancements have allowed researchers to explore the complexities of brain function, revealing how various neural pathways and neurotransmitters influence behavior, emotion, and decision-making. Key milestones in neuroscience's evolution include the discovery of the synaptic plasticity phenomenon, which underpins learning and memory, and the development of neuroeconomics, which examines how brain activity influences economic decision-making.

#### Guest Experience

The historical development of hospitality management has focused on customer service, emphasizing the importance of guest satisfaction and loyalty. Early hospitality practices were rooted in basic service delivery, but as the industry evolved, the concept of guest experience emerged as a critical area of focus. The rise of personalization, technology integration, and experiential marketing has transformed how hospitality businesses engage with their customers. This evolution has underscored the need for a deeper understanding of the psychological and emotional factors that drive guest preferences and behaviors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent trends in emotional neuroscience and neuroeconomics have provided valuable insights into how emotions shape human behavior. Research has shown that emotions play a pivotal role in decision-making processes, influencing choices that range from mundane daily activities to significant life decisions. Understanding the brain's reward systems, such as the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and oxytocin, can offer hospitality professionals a framework for enhancing guest interactions and fostering loyalty.

#### Guest Experience

In the realm of hospitality, current paradigms emphasize personalization, service quality, and the integration of technology to enhance guest experiences. Studies have highlighted the importance of emotional engagement in driving customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the application of neuroscience principles to these paradigms, indicating an opportunity for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from both fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience with hospitality presents a significant gap in existing literature. This dissertation seeks to address this gap by exploring how insights from neuroscience can enhance personalization and emotional connection in guest experiences. The integration of neuroscience principles into hospitality practices has the potential to revolutionize the industry, offering new strategies for guest engagement and service recovery.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theories in neuroscience that will inform this research include:

- **Neural Networks:** The interconnected pathways in the brain that facilitate communication between neurons, influencing behavior and emotional responses.
- **Synaptic Plasticity:** The brain's ability to adapt and reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, which is crucial for learning and memory.
- **Neurotransmitter Functions:** The roles of various neurotransmitters, including dopamine (associated with reward and pleasure) and serotonin (linked to mood regulation), in influencing emotional states and decision-making.

#### Guest Experience Theories

Theoretical frameworks relevant to guest experience include:

- **Service Quality Models:** These models, such as the SERVQUAL framework, assess service quality based on dimensions like reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and responsiveness.
- **Customer Satisfaction Theories:** These theories explore the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction, emphasizing the importance of meeting or exceeding guest expectations.
- **Emotional Engagement Frameworks:** These frameworks focus on the role of emotions in shaping customer experiences, highlighting the significance of emotional connections in driving loyalty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes two new theoretical constructs that emerge from the intersection of neuroscience and guest experience:

- **Emotional Resonance Theory:** This theory posits that emotional engagement significantly impacts guest satisfaction and loyalty. By understanding the emotional triggers that resonate with guests, hospitality businesses can tailor their service delivery to create more meaningful interactions.
- **Service Plasticity Model:** This model suggests that hospitality businesses can adapt their service recovery strategies based on insights from synaptic plasticity. By recognizing that guest perceptions can be reshaped through effective recovery efforts, businesses can foster resilience and loyalty among their clientele.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be proposed, combining neuroscience principles with guest experience frameworks to enhance service delivery and guest interactions. This model will emphasize the importance of emotional engagement, personalization, and adaptive service recovery strategies in creating exceptional guest experiences.
