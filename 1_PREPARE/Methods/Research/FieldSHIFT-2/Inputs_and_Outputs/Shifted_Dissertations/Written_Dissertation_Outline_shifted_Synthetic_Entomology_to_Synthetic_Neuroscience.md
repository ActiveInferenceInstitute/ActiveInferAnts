## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of entomology and neuroscience represents a novel academic endeavor that seeks to leverage the adaptive strategies of insects to inform our understanding of neural mechanisms. Insects, with their complex social structures and remarkable adaptability, provide a unique lens through which to examine cognitive processes. The study of insects has long been confined to ecological and biological perspectives, often neglecting the cognitive and neural underpinnings that drive their behaviors. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap, offering insights that may enhance our understanding of not only insect behavior but also the fundamental principles of cognition in higher organisms.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, offering fresh perspectives on neural networks and social behavior. By integrating insights from entomology into neuroscience, the study aims to bridge gaps in understanding how complex systems adapt and function. The novelty of this research lies in its potential to create a new framework for studying neural processes by utilizing insect models, which are often simpler and more manipulable than mammalian systems. This could lead to breakthroughs in understanding neural plasticity, communication, and collective behavior, thereby enriching both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of metamorphosis in insects inform our understanding of neural plasticity in the brain?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Entomology

Entomology has evolved significantly from its early classification systems to modern applications in ecology and agriculture. Initially focused on taxonomy and species identification, the field has expanded to include the study of insect behavior, physiology, and ecology. The advent of molecular techniques has further enriched our understanding of genetic and evolutionary processes in insects, allowing for a more nuanced view of their roles in ecosystems.

#### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has similarly undergone a transformative journey, evolving from basic anatomical studies to sophisticated neuroimaging and neurotechnology. The development of techniques such as functional MRI and optogenetics has enabled researchers to explore the complexities of neural circuits and their implications for behavior and cognition. This evolution has paved the way for an integrated understanding of how neural processes govern behavior across species.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Entomology

Current research in entomology focuses on biodiversity, ecological roles, and sustainable practices. Studies have highlighted the critical roles insects play in pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies that connect insect behavior with underlying neural mechanisms, particularly in the context of social behavior and communication.

#### Neuroscience

In neuroscience, significant advances have been made in understanding neural circuits, plasticity, and the implications for mental health. However, there is a growing recognition of the need for interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate insights from other fields, such as biology and ecology, to develop a more holistic understanding of cognitive processes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary studies that connect insect behavior with neural processes. This dissertation aims to address this gap by exploring how principles from entomology can inform our understanding of neural mechanisms, thereby opening new avenues for research and application. By understanding the shared mechanisms of adaptation and communication, we may innovate therapeutic strategies and enhance our understanding of collective behavior.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Entomology

Key theories in entomology include those related to adaptation, social behavior, and ecological interactions. The study of social insects, such as ants and bees, has revealed complex social structures and communication strategies that are critical for colony survival. Theories of kin selection and altruism have been foundational in understanding the evolution of social behaviors in these species.

#### Neuroscience

In neuroscience, foundational theories include synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. The Hebbian theory, which posits that "cells that fire together wire together," has been instrumental in understanding how experiences shape neural connections. Additionally, the concept of neural plasticity emphasizes the brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to learning and environmental changes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Neuro-metamorphosis

This construct posits that neural circuits exhibit metamorphic properties similar to insect metamorphosis. Just as insects undergo profound transformations during their life cycle, the brain may also exhibit dynamic reconfigurations in response to experiences and environmental stimuli.

#### Collective Cognition

This theory draws parallels between the organization of insect societies and human neural networks. By studying how insects make collective decisions, we can gain insights into the dynamics of human cognition and social interactions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will be proposed that synthesizes principles from entomology and neuroscience, illustrating how insect behaviors can inform neural processes and vice versa. This model will serve as a framework for future research, guiding empirical investigations into the connections between insect behavior and cognitive functions.
