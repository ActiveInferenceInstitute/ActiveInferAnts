# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary traditions is a rich tapestry woven through cultural, geographical, and historical threads. From ancient cooking methods to modern gastronomy, culinary practices have transformed dramatically. Historical cooking techniques, such as fermentation, smoking, and baking, not only reflect the technological advancements of their time but also cultural significance, serving as a means of community building and identity. The understanding of flavor combinations and ingredient pairings has evolved, influenced by global trade and migration patterns, leading to the emergence of fusion cuisines that reflect diverse culinary influences.

### Logistics

Logistics, as a discipline, has undergone significant transformation since its inception. Initially focused on military supply chains, logistics has evolved into a critical component of supply chain management, encompassing transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and distribution. Key milestones in logistics technology, such as the introduction of containerization in the 1950s and the advent of information technology in the 1990s, have revolutionized the field, enabling greater efficiency and responsiveness to consumer demands. The rise of e-commerce has further accelerated the need for innovative logistics solutions that prioritize speed and accuracy.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Cuisine

Recent trends in culinary innovation emphasize the importance of sensory perception and customer experience in modern gastronomy. The rise of experiential dining, where the ambiance, presentation, and even the preparation of food become integral to the culinary experience, highlights the evolving expectations of consumers. Additionally, the increasing awareness of sustainability and health consciousness has led to a greater emphasis on local sourcing, organic ingredients, and dietary accommodations, further shaping the culinary landscape.

### Logistics

In the logistics sector, advances in supply chain management, technology integration, and sustainability practices have become paramount. The incorporation of data analytics, automation, and artificial intelligence has enabled logistics companies to optimize their operations and respond swiftly to market changes. However, challenges such as rising consumer expectations, labor shortages, and environmental concerns persist, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both culinary arts and logistics, there remains a significant gap in interdisciplinary research that combines these two fields. The lack of collaboration presents an opportunity for enhancing logistics practices through culinary-inspired methodologies. By exploring how culinary principles can inform logistics operations, this research aims to bridge the gap and develop innovative frameworks that benefit both domains.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The exploration of culinary theories related to flavor, preparation, and sensory experience provides a foundation for understanding how these concepts can be applied to logistics.
