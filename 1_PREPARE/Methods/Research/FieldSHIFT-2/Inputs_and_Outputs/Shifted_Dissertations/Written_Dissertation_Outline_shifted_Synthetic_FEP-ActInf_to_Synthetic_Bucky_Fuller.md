## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference within the paradigms established by Buckminster Fuller. By analyzing the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research will develop a new theoretical framework for adaptive design systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine design methodologies, promote sustainability, and enhance resource management. The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications in architecture, engineering, environmental science, and cognitive science, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), articulated primarily by neuroscientist Karl Friston, posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy through predictive coding and active inference. This principle fundamentally reorients our understanding of cognition, perception, and action, framing them as processes of minimizing surprise and uncertainty in a dynamic environment. In parallel, Buckminster Fuller’s work emphasizes holistic design and resource efficiency, advocating for a comprehensive approach to human habitation and environmental stewardship. Fuller’s philosophy, encapsulated in concepts such as Synergetics and Tensegrity, encourages a systemic view of design that prioritizes sustainability and the intelligent use of resources.

This dissertation will investigate how these principles can be integrated to foster a new paradigm in design, characterized by adaptability and predictive modeling. By synthesizing FEP and Fuller’s design philosophy, we can create a framework that enhances our understanding of adaptive systems in design and architecture.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The research is novel in its approach to merging cognitive science with design philosophy. The integration of FEP into Fuller’s work represents a transformative opportunity to address contemporary challenges in architecture and environmental resource management. By applying the principles of FEP to Fuller’s design science, we can develop predictive design models that enhance sustainability and efficiency. This approach not only broadens the scope of design methodologies but also provides a theoretical foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. **How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference inform and enhance design methodologies?**
2. **In what ways can Fuller’s concepts of design science be framed as adaptive systems?**
3. **What are the implications of this integration for sustainability and resource management in design practices?**

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and cognitive science, with Friston’s work drawing from a variety of disciplines, including biology, neuroscience, and philosophy. It posits that living systems maintain their states through processes that minimize free energy, or surprise, by adapting their internal models of the world. This principle has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes and adaptive behavior.

Conversely, Buckminster Fuller’s contributions to design and architecture are characterized by a commitment to sustainability and efficiency. His work, which includes the geodesic dome and the concept of "Spaceship Earth," emphasizes the interconnectedness of human systems and the environment. Fuller’s design philosophy advocates for a holistic approach that considers the long-term implications of design decisions on ecological systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements in predictive processing and active inference have illuminated the cognitive mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior. Studies have demonstrated how these principles can enhance our understanding of perception, decision-making, and learning in dynamic environments. In architecture, Fuller’s design principles have gained renewed attention, with contemporary architects and designers applying his concepts to create sustainable and innovative structures.

However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the integration of cognitive science with design philosophy. Few studies have explored how the FEP can inform design methodologies, and even fewer have examined the potential for adaptive design frameworks that promote sustainability.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This dissertation identifies a significant opportunity to bridge the gap between cognitive science and design. By merging the theoretical insights of the FEP with Fuller’s design principles, we can develop adaptive design frameworks that respond to environmental challenges and enhance resource management. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to yield innovative solutions to pressing global issues, such as climate change and urbanization.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a robust framework for understanding adaptive systems. Predictive processing posits that the brain continuously generates predictions about sensory input and updates its beliefs based on the difference between predicted and actual input. This mechanism underlies the concept of active inference, where organisms take actions to minimize prediction errors and adapt to their environments.

Buckminster Fuller’s concepts, including Synergetics and Tensegrity, further enrich this framework. Synergetics emphasizes the importance of holistic design, where the relationships between components are as crucial as the components themselves. Tensegrity, on the other hand, illustrates how structures can achieve stability through a balance of tension and compression, reflecting the principles of adaptability and efficiency.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes the development of **Predictive Design Models**—a conceptual framework that applies the principles of FEP to the design process. These models emphasize the importance of prediction, feedback, and adaptation in design, allowing for iterative improvements based on real-time data and user interactions.

Additionally, the concept of **Active Design Inference** will be introduced as a framework for iterative design processes. This framework highlights the role of feedback loops in enhancing design outcomes, enabling designers to respond dynamically to changing conditions and user needs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines the principles of FEP and Fuller’s design philosophy to create a comprehensive framework for adaptive design. This model posits that successful design processes must incorporate predictive modeling, active inference, and holistic approaches to resource management. By fostering an understanding of design as an adaptive, predictive process, this framework aims to redefine design practices in architecture and engineering.
