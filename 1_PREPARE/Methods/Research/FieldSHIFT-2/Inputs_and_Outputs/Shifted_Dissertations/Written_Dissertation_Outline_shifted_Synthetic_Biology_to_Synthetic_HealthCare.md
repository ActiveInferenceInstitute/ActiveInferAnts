# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Concepts from Biology to Health Care

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating biological principles into health care, creating a novel framework known as the "Patient Ecosystem Model." This interdisciplinary approach seeks to enhance patient experience, optimize health outcomes, and foster collaboration among healthcare providers. By examining the interplay between biological concepts and healthcare practices, this research has the potential to revolutionize patient care, inform policy, and contribute to the emergence of new sub-disciplines within health care.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of biology and health care presents an innovative lens through which to examine patient interactions, health outcomes, and service delivery. Traditional health care models often overlook the dynamic relationships between various elements within the healthcare ecosystem, which can be better understood through biological principles. Biological systems are characterized by their complexity, interdependence, and adaptability—qualities that are increasingly recognized as essential for effective health care delivery. By adopting an ecological perspective, we can better appreciate how environmental, social, and biological factors converge to shape patient experiences and health outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it establishes a new paradigm for understanding health care through the lens of biology. By applying ecological, population, and cellular concepts, the dissertation aims to create a cohesive framework that enhances patient-centered care and addresses systemic challenges within health care. The Patient Ecosystem Model represents a shift from traditional, linear approaches to a more holistic understanding of patient care, emphasizing the importance of relationships and interactions among various stakeholders, including patients, providers, and the broader community.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The primary research questions guiding this dissertation are:

- How can biological principles inform and improve patient experience in health care settings?
- What are the implications of applying population dynamics to health care resource allocation?
- How can healthcare systems be designed to function like biological systems, ensuring coordinated care?

The objectives of this research include:

1. Developing a comprehensive understanding of how biological principles can be applied to health care.
2. Creating the Patient Ecosystem Model as a framework for enhancing patient experience and health outcomes.
3. Identifying and analyzing key interactions within the healthcare ecosystem that can inform policy and practice.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical separation between biological sciences and health care practices has roots in the development of both fields. Biology has evolved through various paradigms, from classical genetics to modern molecular biology, while health care has traditionally focused on clinical practices, diagnostics, and treatment protocols. The rise of evidence-based medicine in the late 20th century marked a significant shift in health care, emphasizing the importance of research and data in clinical decision-making. However, this focus often neglected the complex interplay of biological, environmental, and social factors that influence health.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The existing literature in biology offers valuable insights into ecosystems, population dynamics, and cellular mechanisms. For instance, ecological theories highlight the importance of biodiversity and interdependence among species, which can be applied to understand the diversity of patient needs and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in health care. Population health literature emphasizes the role of social determinants, such as socioeconomic status and community resources, in shaping health outcomes. Meanwhile, health care research increasingly acknowledges the significance of patient experience, service quality, and technology integration, underscoring the need for a more holistic approach to care.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps remain in the current research that fails to consider the interaction between biological principles and health care. For example, while there is a growing body of literature on social determinants of health, there is limited exploration of how ecological models can inform resource allocation and care delivery. This presents an opportunity for interdisciplinary research that bridges biology and health care, fostering innovative solutions to complex health challenges.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Ecological theories related to ecosystems and interactions provide a foundation for understanding the complex relationships within health care. The concept of ecological niche, for example, can be applied to analyze how different healthcare providers fulfill specific roles within the patient ecosystem. Additionally, population health theories focusing on health determinants and community dynamics can inform strategies for addressing health disparities and improving outcomes for vulnerable populations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The introduction of the Patient Ecosystem Model serves as a novel framework for understanding health care interactions. This model emphasizes the interconnectedness of various elements within the healthcare ecosystem, including patients, providers, and community resources. Furthermore, the concept of Health Keystone Factors—critical elements that significantly influence health outcomes—emerges as a key component of this framework, guiding interventions and resource allocation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model combines biological principles with health care practices, illustrating the interdependencies among various elements of the healthcare ecosystem. This model emphasizes feedback loops, adaptive responses, and the importance of maintaining balance within the system. By framing health care as a dynamic ecosystem, we can better understand the complexities of patient care and the factors that contribute to successful health outcomes.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to comprehensively address the research questions. The design includes case studies, surveys, and experimental designs to test hypotheses and gather diverse data.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection involves multiple methods to capture the complexities of patient experiences and healthcare interactions. Surveys and interviews with healthcare providers and patients will provide insights into perceptions of care and the factors influencing satisfaction. Additionally, quantitative data on health outcomes and patient experiences will be collected from healthcare systems to identify trends and correlations.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis of survey data will be employed to identify significant relationships between biological principles and patient outcomes. Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews will help uncover underlying themes and patterns in patient experiences, providing a richer understanding of the healthcare ecosystem.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical implications related to patient confidentiality and informed consent are paramount in this research. Strategies for ensuring ethical research practices include obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring data anonymity, and adhering to institutional review board (IRB) guidelines. Careful attention to ethical considerations will enhance the credibility and integrity of the research.
