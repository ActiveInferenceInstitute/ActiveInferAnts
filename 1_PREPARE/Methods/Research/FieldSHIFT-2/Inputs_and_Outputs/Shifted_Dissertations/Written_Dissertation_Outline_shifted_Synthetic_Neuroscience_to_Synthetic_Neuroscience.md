## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Neural Networks

Biological neural networks are complex systems composed of neurons that transmit signals through synapses. The architecture of these networks allows for intricate communication pathways, enabling sophisticated processes such as learning, memory, and sensory perception. Fundamental mechanisms such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity, facilitating the strengthening or weakening of synapses based on activity patterns. This dynamic adaptability is essential for learning and memory formation.

#### Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks

The evolution of ANNs has been marked by significant milestones, from the early perceptrons of the 1950s to the deep learning architectures that dominate contemporary AI research. Initial models were simplistic, focusing on linear separability, but advances in computational power and algorithmic sophistication have led to the development of multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Despite these advancements, traditional ANNs often struggle with issues such as overfitting, lack of interpretability, and limited adaptability, highlighting the need for innovative approaches that incorporate biological principles.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Research on Synaptic Plasticity

Research on synaptic plasticity has revealed critical insights into how biological systems learn and adapt. Mechanisms such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) demonstrate that the timing of neuronal firing can influence synaptic strength, providing a robust framework for understanding learning processes. This body of research offers potential pathways for integrating similar mechanisms into ANN training algorithms, allowing for more nuanced learning strategies.

#### Analysis of Current Challenges in ANNs

Despite significant progress, ANNs face several challenges, including interpretability and generalization. The "black box" nature of many deep learning models complicates understanding their decision-making processes, raising concerns about their application in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. Additionally, issues related to overfitting and the inability to generalize across varied datasets limit the practical utility of these models. Addressing these challenges through biologically inspired approaches presents a promising avenue for future research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of biological principles into computational models remains underexplored. While some research has begun to address this gap, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks that systematically incorporate insights from neuroscience into ANN design. Opportunities for innovative research exist in developing algorithms that emulate biological learning mechanisms, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of neural networks. This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by proposing a framework that bridges the disciplines of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neural Plasticity Theories

Neural plasticity theories, particularly LTP and LTD, are foundational to understanding learning processes in biological systems. LTP is characterized by the persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity, while LTD involves the weakening of synapses due to low-frequency stimulation. These mechanisms are crucial for encoding memories and adapting to new information, providing a theoretical basis for incorporating similar dynamics into ANN training algorithms.

#### Theories of Neuron Diversity

The diversity of neuron types in biological systems contributes significantly to information processing capabilities. Different neurons exhibit varied firing patterns, synaptic dynamics, and neurotransmitter release profiles, allowing for complex computations and adaptive behavior. Understanding these diverse roles can inform the design of ANN architectures that leverage multiple neuron types to improve performance and adaptability.
