## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of William Blake's Life, Artistic Philosophy, and Contributions

William Blake (1757-1827) was a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, known for his poetry, painting, and printmaking. His works, such as "Songs of Innocence and of Experience" and "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," delve into the complexities of human existence, exploring themes of duality, spirituality, and the nature of creativity. Blake's artistic philosophy emphasized the importance of imagination and the interconnectedness of all things, viewing art as a means to transcend the material world and engage with the divine.

#### Evolution of Culinary Arts

The culinary arts have evolved significantly over centuries, influenced by cultural exchanges, technological advancements, and changing societal values. From the communal practices of ancient civilizations to the contemporary rise of fusion cuisine, culinary practices reflect the complexities of cultural identity and human experience. The modern culinary landscape is characterized by an increasing emphasis on storytelling, sustainability, and the integration of diverse culinary traditions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Literature on Blake's Philosophies

Existing literature on Blake's philosophies often focuses on his contributions to literature and visual arts, with discussions surrounding his concepts of duality, imagination, and the human condition. Scholars such as Northrop Frye and David Erdman have analyzed Blake's texts, revealing the depth of his symbolic language and the philosophical underpinnings of his work.

#### Analysis of Current Culinary Trends

Current culinary trends highlight the rise of narrative cooking, where chefs use storytelling to enhance the dining experience. The concept of fusion cuisine has gained popularity, reflecting the blending of diverse culinary traditions and the exploration of new flavor profiles. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects literary and artistic principles with culinary practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of Blake's work and culinary arts presents a unique opportunity to fill existing gaps in interdisciplinary research. By applying Blake's artistic principles to culinary practices, this dissertation aims to foster innovation in culinary education, practice, and consumer engagement, ultimately enriching the dining experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Blake's Theory of Contraries and Duality

Blake's theory of contraries posits that opposing forces are essential for understanding the human experience. This duality is reflected in his poetry and visual art, where innocence and experience coexist, revealing the complexities of life. This theory can be applied to culinary practices, where contrasting flavors and techniques can create a harmonious dining experience.

#### The Role of Creativity and Imagination in Artistic Expression

Blake emphasized the importance of imagination as a transformative force in both art and life. His belief that creativity is rooted in the divine aligns with the notion that culinary creation can transcend mere sustenance, becoming a form of artistic expression.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Duality Theory

Culinary Duality Theory posits that balancing opposing flavors and techniques can enhance the dining experience. This theory draws parallels to Blake's exploration of duality, suggesting that the interplay of contrasting elements can create a richer culinary narrative.

#### Culinary Mythos

Culinary Mythos refers to the narrative significance of dishes, emphasizing the stories and cultural meanings embedded in food. This concept aligns with Blake's belief in the power of storytelling and its ability to connect individuals to their cultural roots.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that synthesizes Blake's artistic principles with culinary practices. This model emphasizes creativity, duality, and interconnectedness, providing a framework for exploring the transformative potential of merging literature, art, and cuisine.
