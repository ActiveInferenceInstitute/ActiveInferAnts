## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cognitive Security

Cognitive security has evolved from the need to protect individuals and societies from the effects of misinformation and disinformation, particularly in the digital age. The principles of cognitive security encompass various methodologies aimed at enhancing critical thinking, information literacy, and resilience against deceptive narratives. The role of technology, particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning, has become increasingly prominent in developing tools for misinformation detection and analysis. As misinformation campaigns have proliferated, understanding the psychological mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to false information has become essential.

#### Insect Ecology

Insect ecology has a rich historical context, with early studies focusing on the classification and behavior of insects. Over time, research has expanded to encompass the ecological roles that insects play, including pollination, decomposition, and as indicators of environmental health. Current challenges facing insect populations are multifaceted, including habitat loss, climate change, pesticide use, and the spread of invasive species. Understanding these challenges is critical for developing effective conservation strategies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Cognitive Security

Recent advancements in cognitive security research have highlighted the importance of media literacy and educational programs designed to enhance critical thinking skills. Studies have shown that individuals equipped with media literacy are better able to identify misinformation and engage with information critically. The integration of AI technologies for misinformation detection has also opened new avenues for research, allowing for real-time identification of false narratives and promoting informed public discourse.

#### Insect Ecology

Current research in insect ecology emphasizes the urgent need for conservation efforts, with studies documenting alarming declines in insect populations globally. The impact of climate change on insect biodiversity and the role of sustainable agricultural practices in supporting insect health are areas of active investigation. Additionally, the intersection of public perception and conservation efforts is gaining attention, with researchers exploring how societal attitudes affect policy and conservation outcomes.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the significant advancements in both cognitive security and insect ecology, there exists a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that combines these fields. The lack of frameworks that address the dual challenges of misinformation and ecological conservation presents an opportunity for innovative research. By integrating cognitive security principles into insect conservation strategies, this dissertation aims to fill this gap and provide actionable insights for enhancing public understanding and engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Cognitive Bias Theory

Cognitive bias theory explores the systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, which can significantly influence human perception and decision-making. Common cognitive biases that may affect public attitudes toward insects include confirmation bias, where individuals favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs, and the availability heuristic, where people judge the frequency or likelihood of events based on how easily examples come to mind. Understanding these biases is crucial for developing effective communication strategies that counter misinformation.

#### Ecological Theory

Ecological theory emphasizes the interdependence of species within ecosystems and the concept of ecological balance. Insects play critical roles in maintaining ecosystem health, serving as pollinators, decomposers, and food sources for other organisms. The loss of insect biodiversity can lead to cascading effects on ecosystem functions and services. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of ecological theory is essential for framing the importance of insect conservation within the broader context of environmental sustainability.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Insect Cognitive Security Theory

This dissertation proposes the development of an "Insect Cognitive Security Theory," which integrates cognitive security principles into insect conservation strategies. This theoretical framework will explore how misinformation influences public perceptions of insects and how cognitive biases can be addressed through targeted educational interventions. By situating insect conservation within the cognitive security paradigm, this theory aims to enhance public engagement and support for conservation efforts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the relationship between cognitive biases, misinformation, and insect conservation outcomes. This model posits that misinformation can exacerbate cognitive biases, leading to negative public perceptions of insects and ultimately hindering conservation efforts. Conversely, educational interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive resilience can mitigate these biases and promote a more accurate understanding of the ecological roles of insects. This model serves as a foundation for the research design and analysis in subsequent chapters.
