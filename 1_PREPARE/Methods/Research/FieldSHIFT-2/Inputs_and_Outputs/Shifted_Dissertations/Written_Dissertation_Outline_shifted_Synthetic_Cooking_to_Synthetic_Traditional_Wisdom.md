## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating culinary practices with traditional knowledge systems, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework termed “Culinary Ecology.” By investigating the intersections of cuisine and traditional knowledge, this research will address pressing issues such as biodiversity conservation, cultural identity preservation, and sustainable food systems. The findings will have significant implications for both culinary arts and environmental science, fostering a deeper understanding of how food practices can enhance community resilience and ecological health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of culinary arts and traditional knowledge. Cuisine, characterized by its diverse techniques, cultural significance, and ecological considerations, intersects with traditional knowledge, which emphasizes sustainability and community identity. This dissertation will examine how these two domains can inform and enrich one another. Culinary practices are not merely about sustenance; they embody a complex interplay of history, culture, and ecology. Traditional knowledge systems, particularly those of indigenous communities, encapsulate centuries of ecological wisdom that can inform contemporary culinary practices. This intersection provides fertile ground for exploring how culinary arts can serve as a vehicle for preserving and promoting traditional ecological knowledge.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it recognizes the role of culinary practices as vital components of traditional knowledge systems. By bridging these fields, the dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of sustainability in food practices, the preservation of cultural identities, and the promotion of biodiversity. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, combining culinary studies, anthropology, and environmental science to create a framework that highlights the importance of food in ecological and cultural contexts. This framework, termed Culinary Ecology, will provide insights into how culinary practices can foster community resilience and ecological health.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can culinary practices serve as a means of preserving traditional ecological knowledge?
2. In what ways do culinary traditions contribute to community resilience and cultural identity?
3. How can modern scientific approaches enhance traditional culinary practices for sustainable outcomes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The evolution of culinary practices across cultures reveals a rich tapestry of human experience. Food has always been a central element of social and cultural identity, serving not only as nourishment but also as a medium for expressing values, beliefs, and traditions. Historical accounts illustrate how culinary techniques have been passed down through generations, often adapting to local resources and environmental conditions. The role of food in rituals, celebrations, and daily life underscores its significance in shaping cultural identity.

#### Traditional Knowledge

Traditional knowledge encompasses the insights and practices developed by indigenous and local communities over generations. These practices are deeply rooted in the ecological contexts of the communities that uphold them. Historical perspectives reveal the challenges faced in preserving traditional knowledge, particularly in the face of globalization and environmental degradation. The loss of biodiversity and the erosion of cultural practices are interconnected issues that necessitate a reevaluation of how traditional knowledge is valued and integrated into contemporary practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Contemporary culinary trends increasingly emphasize sustainability, with chefs and food producers seeking to source ingredients responsibly and minimize waste. Research on traditional ecological knowledge highlights its relevance in addressing modern environmental challenges, including climate change and biodiversity loss. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the integration of culinary practices with traditional knowledge systems. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring how these fields can inform and enhance one another.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The lack of interdisciplinary research combining culinary arts and traditional knowledge presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The potential for new methodologies that integrate culinary practices with ecological sustainability is vast. This research will explore innovative approaches to understanding the relationship between food, culture, and the environment, ultimately contributing to the development of Culinary Ecology as a distinct field of study.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Culinary Theory

Culinary theory encompasses the principles guiding the preparation, presentation, and appreciation of food. Key concepts include flavor pairing, which explores the chemical and sensory interactions between ingredients, and the cultural significance of food, which examines how culinary practices reflect and shape social identities.

#### Traditional Knowledge Theory

Traditional knowledge theory emphasizes the importance of sustainability and ecological balance. It recognizes the intricate relationships between communities and their environments, highlighting the need for practices that honor and preserve biodiversity. This theoretical foundation will inform the exploration of how culinary practices can embody and transmit traditional ecological knowledge.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Culinary Ecology

Culinary Ecology emerges as a new theoretical construct that examines the relationship between culinary practices and local ecosystems. It posits that food systems are not isolated entities but are deeply interconnected with ecological health and cultural identity.

#### Cultural Resilience Model

The Cultural Resilience Model explores the interplay between culinary traditions and community resilience. It posits that communities that maintain their culinary heritage are better equipped to adapt to environmental changes and challenges.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model illustrates the interconnectedness of culinary practices, traditional knowledge, and ecological sustainability. It highlights feedback loops between these elements, demonstrating how culinary practices can enhance traditional ecological knowledge and vice versa.
