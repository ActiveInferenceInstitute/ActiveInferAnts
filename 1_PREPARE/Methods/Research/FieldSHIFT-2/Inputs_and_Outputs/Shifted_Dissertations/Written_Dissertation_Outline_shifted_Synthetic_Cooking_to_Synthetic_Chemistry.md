## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Cuisine

The exploration of culinary practices reveals a rich tapestry woven through historical migrations, cultural exchanges, and technological advancements. From the early days of fire cooking to the advent of refrigeration and modernist cuisine, culinary practices have evolved dramatically. Historical texts, such as Apicius's *De Re Coquinaria*, showcase ancient Roman culinary techniques, while the introduction of spices during the Age of Exploration transformed global cuisine. The emergence of molecular gastronomy in the late 20th century marked a pivotal moment, where chefs began to apply scientific principles to cooking, thereby blurring the lines between culinary art and scientific inquiry.

#### Chemistry

Chemistry, evolving from alchemy to modern scientific practices, has undergone significant transformations. The transition from mystical interpretations of matter to empirical investigations in the 17th century laid the groundwork for modern chemistry. Pioneers such as Antoine Lavoisier established the law of conservation of mass, while Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table provided a systematic framework for understanding chemical elements. The development of analytical techniques, such as chromatography and spectroscopy, has further enabled chemists to dissect complex molecular interactions, paving the way for interdisciplinary applications in various fields, including food science.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
