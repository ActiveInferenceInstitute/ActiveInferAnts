# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Evolution of Guest Experience in Hospitality

The concept of guest experience has evolved significantly over the decades, transitioning from basic service provision to a nuanced understanding of customer satisfaction and emotional engagement. Early hospitality models focused primarily on the functional aspects of service delivery, emphasizing efficiency and convenience. However, as competition intensified, the industry began to recognize the importance of creating memorable experiences that resonate with guests on an emotional level. This shift was influenced by various factors, including changing consumer expectations, advancements in technology, and the rise of experiential marketing. Contemporary hospitality practices now prioritize personalization, engagement, and the creation of unique experiences tailored to individual preferences.

### Historical Developments in Mitochondrial Research

Mitochondrial research has undergone significant advancements since the discovery of these organelles in the mid-19th century. Initially, mitochondria were studied primarily for their role in cellular respiration and ATP production. However, as research progressed, scientists began to uncover the multifaceted roles of mitochondria in apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. The identification of mitochondrial DNA and its implications for hereditary diseases further propelled research in this field. Today, the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributing factor to various metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging has opened new avenues for therapeutic interventions.
