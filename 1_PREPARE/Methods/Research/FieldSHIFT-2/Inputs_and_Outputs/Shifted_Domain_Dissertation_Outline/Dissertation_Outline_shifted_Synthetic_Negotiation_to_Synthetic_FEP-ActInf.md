# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of the Free Energy Principle (FEP)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a transformative framework that redefines negotiation as a dynamic process of minimizing variational free energy. By integrating principles from cognitive science with established negotiation methodologies, this research seeks to uncover new insights into interpersonal dynamics, enhance negotiation strategies, and foster collaborative outcomes. The findings have the potential to revolutionize both negotiation practices and theoretical frameworks in cognitive science, offering significant implications for education, industry, and societal interactions.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation has traditionally been viewed as a process of dialogue and compromise aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems, including human cognition, work to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, presenting negotiation as an adaptive system that can be analyzed through the lens of FEP.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of negotiation theory with the Free Energy Principle is groundbreaking, as it opens up new avenues for understanding complex social interactions and decision-making processes. This research not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of negotiation but also has practical implications for enhancing negotiation practices across various cultural contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation be conceptualized as a process of minimizing variational free energy?
2. In what ways can active inference inform negotiation strategies and tactics?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of negotiation and FEP, and how can they be empirically tested?
