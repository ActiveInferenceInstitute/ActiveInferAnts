# PhD Dissertation Plan: Negotiation as Active Inference through the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through the lens of active inference. By integrating these two domains, the research seeks to redefine negotiation as a dynamic process of predictive coding, where parties engage in adaptive strategies to minimize variational free energy. The significance of this study lies in its potential to transform negotiation practices, enhance understanding of interpersonal dynamics, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The anticipated impact extends beyond academic contributions to practical applications in various sectors, including conflict resolution, organizational behavior, and international diplomacy.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation is traditionally viewed as a process of dialogue aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements. In contrast, the Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize free energy to maintain their integrity. This dissertation proposes that negotiation can be reframed as an active inference process, where parties generate predictions about each other's interests and adjust their strategies accordingly.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on negotiation processes through the principles of cognitive science. By conceptualizing negotiation as an active inference mechanism, it provides a robust framework for understanding complex interpersonal interactions and cultural dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation be modeled as an active inference process?
2. What are the implications of cultural differences on generative models in negotiation?
3. How can predictive coding enhance negotiation outcomes?
