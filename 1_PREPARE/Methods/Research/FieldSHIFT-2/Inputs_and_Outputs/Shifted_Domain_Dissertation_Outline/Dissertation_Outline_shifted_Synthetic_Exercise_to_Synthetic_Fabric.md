# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Exercise into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of exercise science and the fabric industry, proposing a Shifted Domain that integrates physical activity with textile creation. This research will investigate how physical engagement in fabric arts can enhance creativity, improve health outcomes, and foster community engagement. By establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework and utilizing interdisciplinary methodologies, the dissertation will contribute to both fields, offering new insights into health, design, and social cohesion.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges exercise science—focused on health and physical activity—with the fabric industry, which encompasses design, production, and cultural expression. This fusion presents a unique opportunity to reframe the understanding of textile arts as a physically engaging practice that promotes well-being.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional notions of sedentary fabric creation, proposing that physical activity can enhance creativity and innovation in textile design. The novelty lies in the systematic exploration of how exercise principles can inform and transform fabric arts, leading to new methodologies and applications.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How does physical engagement in fabric creation influence design outcomes?
2. What physiological and psychological benefits arise from integrating exercise into textile arts?
3. How can the principles of exercise science inform sustainable practices in the fabric industry?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Exercise:** Evolution from ancient health practices to modern sports science; the growing recognition of holistic health benefits.
- **Fabric Industry:** Transition from artisanal craftsmanship to industrial production; the impact of digital technologies on design and sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Exercise Science:** Emphasis on progressive overload, recovery, and the integration of technology in fitness.
