# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge to Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) into Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By systematically transposing principles from TK into the predictive frameworks of PME, this research proposes to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making processes across various fields. The significance of this work lies in its potential to foster sustainable practices, cultural inclusivity, and resilience in the face of complex global challenges. This dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis of the synergies between TK and PME, develop new theoretical constructs, and present practical applications that can revolutionize the field of predictive analytics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between Traditional Knowledge, characterized by its sustainability and community-centered practices, and Prediction Matter Expertise, which emphasizes data-driven decision-making and continuous learning. This fusion seeks to leverage the strengths of both domains to create a more holistic approach to prediction and decision-making.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of TK into PME is significant because it challenges the conventional data-centric paradigms of PME and introduces a more inclusive approach that values qualitative insights. This research is novel in its systematic approach to merging these two distinct fields, providing a framework for understanding complex systems through a culturally informed lens.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Knowledge enhance the predictive accuracy of models in PME?
2. What are the mechanisms through which community engagement can improve data synthesis in predictive analytics?
3. In what ways can cultural practices serve as tools for predictive modeling?
