# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the integration of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into the emerging field of Cognitive Security. By synthesizing principles and methodologies from these two distinct domains, the research seeks to develop innovative frameworks and strategies to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive threats. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize our approach to safeguarding cognitive processes, offering new insights into interdisciplinary collaboration, educational reform, and practical applications in both policy and industry. The ultimate goal is to create a robust, anticipatory model of cognitive security that empowers individuals and communities to navigate the complexities of the modern information landscape.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the predictive capabilities of PME with the protective strategies of Cognitive Security. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge across disciplines to make informed predictions, while Cognitive Security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation. This intersection presents an opportunity to develop comprehensive strategies that enhance cognitive resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing challenges posed by misinformation and cognitive biases in a rapidly evolving information landscape. By integrating PME techniques into Cognitive Security, the dissertation proposes a novel approach that enhances predictive capabilities in identifying and mitigating cognitive threats. This interdisciplinary fusion offers a fresh perspective on cognitive resilience, promoting a proactive rather than reactive stance.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of PME be effectively integrated into Cognitive Security frameworks?
2. What predictive models can be developed to forecast the spread of misinformation?
3. How does interdisciplinary collaboration enhance cognitive resilience?
4. What educational reforms are necessary to prepare future professionals in this integrated field?
