# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of ATM transactions and blockchain technology, a Shifted Domain that promises to redefine the landscape of financial services. By leveraging the strengths of both domains, this research aims to develop a new framework for decentralized banking solutions that enhance security, improve user experience, and promote financial inclusion. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal access to financial resources.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The banking sector has undergone significant transformations since the introduction of ATMs in the late 1960s, evolving from simple cash dispensing machines to complex, multifunctional devices that offer a variety of services. Concurrently, blockchain technology has emerged as a revolutionary force in the financial landscape, enabling secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions. This dissertation investigates the intersection of these two domains, focusing on how blockchain can enhance ATM functionality and vice versa.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of blockchain technology with ATMs represents a novel approach to addressing challenges faced in both domains, such as security vulnerabilities, transaction inefficiencies, and limited access to banking services. This research not only fills existing gaps in the literature but also proposes new models that could transform the way financial transactions are conducted.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can blockchain technology enhance the security and efficiency of ATM transactions?
2. What are the implications of integrating ATMs into a decentralized financial ecosystem?
3. How can user experience principles from ATM design inform the development of blockchain interfaces?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The literature on ATM transactions highlights their evolution from basic cash dispensers to sophisticated banking solutions, while blockchain literature focuses on its origins with Bitcoin and its subsequent applications across various sectors.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent studies have examined the growing integration of mobile payments and contactless transactions in ATMs, alongside research on blockchain scalability and interoperability challenges. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive studies that bridge these two domains.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This research identifies a significant gap in understanding how the principles of ATM transactions can inform blockchain applications, particularly in enhancing user experience and security measures.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Self-Service Banking Theory**: Understanding user autonomy in financial transactions.
2. **Distributed Ledger Theory**: Exploring the principles of transparency and immutability in transaction recording.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Decentralized User Experience (DUX)**: A framework for creating user-friendly interfaces in decentralized applications.
2. **Secure Transaction Flow Theory**: Integrating security protocols from ATMs into blockchain transaction processes.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A model that combines user autonomy, security, and decentralized transaction flows to create a comprehensive framework for B-ATMs.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore user experiences, transaction efficiencies, and security implications of B-ATMs.

## Data Collection Methods

1. Surveys and interviews with users of ATMs and blockchain applications.
2. Pilot studies of blockchain-enabled ATMs in diverse settings.

## Analytical Approaches

1. Statistical analysis of transaction data from pilot programs.
2. Thematic analysis of qualitative data from user interviews.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensuring user privacy and data security throughout the research process, obtaining informed consent, and adhering to ethical guidelines in financial technology research.
