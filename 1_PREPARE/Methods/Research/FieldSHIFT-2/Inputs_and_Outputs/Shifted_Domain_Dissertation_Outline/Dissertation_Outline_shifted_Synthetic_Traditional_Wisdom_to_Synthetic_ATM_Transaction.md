# Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the Shifted Domain, which integrates Traditional Knowledge (TK) with Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. The research aims to uncover how principles of sustainability, community engagement, and holistic understanding inherent in TK can enhance the design, functionality, and user experience of ATMs. By addressing current challenges in ATM transactions and leveraging the strengths of traditional knowledge systems, this study seeks to create a transformative model for banking that promotes ecological stewardship and social cohesion. The potential impact of this research spans across multiple disciplines, offering insights into sustainable finance, user experience design, and community empowerment.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and ATM transactions represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that bridges cultural wisdom with modern banking practices. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the sustainable practices and beliefs of indigenous communities, while ATM transactions are a cornerstone of contemporary financial systems. This dissertation investigates the synergies between these domains to propose innovative solutions for enhancing ATM services.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms in banking by integrating TK into the design and operation of ATMs. The novelty lies in the application of indigenous wisdom to address contemporary issues in financial accessibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability. By doing so, it opens new avenues for research and practice in both traditional knowledge systems and modern banking.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of Traditional Knowledge enhance the design and functionality of ATMs?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating community engagement practices into ATM services?
3. In what ways can sustainable practices from TK contribute to the operational efficiency of ATMs?
