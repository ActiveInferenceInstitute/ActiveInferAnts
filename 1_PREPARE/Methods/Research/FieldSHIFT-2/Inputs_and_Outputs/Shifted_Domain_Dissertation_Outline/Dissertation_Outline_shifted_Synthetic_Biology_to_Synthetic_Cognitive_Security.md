# PhD Dissertation Plan: Reimagining Cognitive Security through Ecological Principles

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of ecosystems and cognitive security, proposing a transformative framework that applies ecological principles to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive manipulation. By identifying isomorphisms between ecosystem dynamics and cognitive processes, this research aims to develop novel theories, models, and practical applications that can significantly impact both fields. The findings will not only advance theoretical knowledge but also offer actionable strategies for organizations and individuals to improve cognitive security.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges ecological frameworks with cognitive security, emphasizing the interconnectedness and resilience of information systems. This paradigm shift recognizes that cognitive security can benefit from the principles governing ecosystems, such as diversity, energy flow, and keystone species.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it presents a pioneering approach to cognitive security, moving beyond traditional technological solutions to incorporate ecological concepts. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary nature of the study, which integrates theories from ecology and cognitive science to propose a holistic view of cognitive security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecological principles enhance the resilience of cognitive security systems?
2. What is the role of diversity in information sources in mitigating cognitive biases?
3. How can the concept of keystone sources inform strategies for protecting cognitive integrity?
