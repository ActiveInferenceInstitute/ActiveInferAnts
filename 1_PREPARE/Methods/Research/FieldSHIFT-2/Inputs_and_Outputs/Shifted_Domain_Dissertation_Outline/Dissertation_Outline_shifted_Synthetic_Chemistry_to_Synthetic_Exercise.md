# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemistry into Exercise Science

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of chemistry and exercise science, proposing a transformative framework that views exercise as a biochemical process akin to chemical reactions. By establishing a systematic transposition of chemical principles into exercise science, this research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind exercise adaptations, enhance adherence through motivational catalysts, and develop personalized exercise prescriptions. The potential impact of this work extends to public health, educational reform, and the development of new interdisciplinary fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel convergence between chemistry, which traditionally focuses on molecular interactions and transformations, and exercise science, which emphasizes physiological responses to physical activity. This interdisciplinary approach offers a fresh perspective on how exercise can be understood and optimized through biochemical principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it fills critical gaps in both fields by integrating molecular biology into exercise science, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of how specific exercises can lead to targeted physiological adaptations. This novel perspective not only enhances the scientific rigor of exercise prescriptions but also promotes a more personalized approach to fitness.
