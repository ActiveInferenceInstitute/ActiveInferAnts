# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Game Design Principles to Health Care

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of game design and health care, proposing a comprehensive framework for integrating game mechanics into health care delivery. By harnessing principles from game design—such as engagement, feedback loops, and personalization—this research aims to revolutionize patient experiences and outcomes. The significance of this study lies in its potential to transform health care practices, enhance patient engagement, and promote healthier behaviors through gamification. The findings will contribute to both fields and offer a blueprint for future interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of game design and health care represents a novel approach to addressing long-standing challenges in patient engagement and care delivery. Game design focuses on creating compelling experiences through structured interactions, while health care traditionally emphasizes clinical processes often detached from patient experiences. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, leveraging the strengths of both to foster a more engaging and effective health care system.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it proposes a paradigm shift in health care, moving from a paternalistic model to one that prioritizes patient engagement through interactive design. The novelty lies in the application of game design principles to health care contexts, which has been largely unexplored. This interdisciplinary approach promises to yield innovative solutions that enhance patient satisfaction and health outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into health care delivery to enhance patient engagement?
2. What specific game mechanics can be employed to improve health literacy and adherence to treatment plans?
3. How do personalized health narratives influence patient experiences and outcomes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Game Design
Game design has evolved from simple mechanics to complex narratives and immersive experiences. Key milestones include the development of arcade games, the rise of indie games, and advancements in virtual reality.

#### Health Care
Health care has transitioned from a paternalistic approach to one that emphasizes patient-centered care, highlighting the importance of patient engagement and shared decision-making.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Game Design
Current trends in game design include the indie game movement, cross-platform play, and the use of VR to create immersive experiences.

#### Health Care
Challenges in health care include fragmented care, communication barriers, and disparities in access. Innovations in patient engagement and technology integration are increasingly recognized as vital.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There is a significant gap in research exploring how game design can inform health care practices. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by identifying and implementing game mechanics that can enhance patient engagement and improve health outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Flow Theory**: Understanding how optimal experiences can be achieved through balance between challenge and skill in both gaming and patient engagement.
- **Self-Determination Theory**: Emphasizing the importance of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in motivating behavior change in health care.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Engagement Theory in Health Care**: A framework that integrates game design principles to enhance patient involvement in their care.
- **Gamified Patient Agency Model**: A model that emphasizes the role of patient agency in health care outcomes through game mechanics.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines game design principles with health care practices, focusing on engagement, feedback, and personalization to improve patient experiences and outcomes.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative surveys to measure patient engagement and qualitative interviews to gather in-depth insights into patient experiences.

### Data Collection Methods

- Surveys assessing patient engagement and satisfaction in gamified versus traditional health care settings.
- Interviews with health care professionals and patients participating in gamified programs.

### Analytical Approaches

- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between gamification and patient outcomes.
- Thematic analysis of interview data to explore patient experiences and perceptions of gamified health care.

### Ethical Considerations

Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and the ethical use of gamification in health care interventions will be paramount. Ethical guidelines will be followed to protect vulnerable populations.
