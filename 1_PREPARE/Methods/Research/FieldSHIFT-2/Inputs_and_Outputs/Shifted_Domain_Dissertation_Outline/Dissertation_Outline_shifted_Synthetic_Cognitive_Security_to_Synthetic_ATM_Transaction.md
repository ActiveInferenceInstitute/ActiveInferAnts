# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles into ATM transactions, an innovative fusion of cognitive security and financial technology. By examining how cognitive biases and misinformation affect user interactions with ATMs, this research seeks to enhance security measures, improve user experience, and ultimately contribute to a more resilient financial ecosystem. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both the fields of cognitive security and financial technology, paving the way for interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of new strategies to mitigate cognitive threats in financial transactions.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of cognitive security—a field focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation—and ATM transactions, which are pivotal in modern banking. As financial transactions increasingly occur in digital environments, understanding the cognitive aspects of user interactions becomes critical in ensuring security and integrity.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses a gap between cognitive security and financial technology, proposing a new framework for enhancing ATM security through cognitive awareness. The novelty lies in applying psychological principles to a traditionally technical field, fostering a holistic approach to security that prioritizes user cognition.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can cognitive security principles be integrated into ATM transaction design to enhance user awareness and decision-making?
2. What impact does cognitive bias have on the security of ATM transactions?
3. How can educational interventions be designed to empower users against cognitive manipulation in financial contexts?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Cognitive Security
Cognitive security has evolved in response to the rise of digital misinformation and manipulation, emphasizing the need for strategies to protect cognitive processes.

### ATM Transactions
The evolution of ATMs from simple cash dispensers to complex financial kiosks reflects the increasing complexity of user interactions and the need for enhanced security measures.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Cognitive Security
Current research focuses on identifying cognitive biases and developing strategies to mitigate misinformation. However, practical applications in financial technology remain underexplored.

### ATM Transactions
While significant advancements in ATM security have been made, the psychological aspects of user interaction and decision-making are often overlooked.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of cognitive security and ATM transactions presents opportunities to address the psychological vulnerabilities of users in financial contexts, leading to innovative security solutions.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: Understanding how conflicting information affects user decision-making.
2. **Social Engineering Principles**: Analyzing manipulation tactics used in fraudulent activities.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Cognitive Transaction Security (CTS)**: A framework for enhancing user awareness and decision-making integrity during ATM transactions.
2. **Bias-Aware Interface (BAI)**: An interface designed to minimize cognitive biases in user interactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model integrates cognitive security principles with ATM transaction design, emphasizing user cognition and decision-making processes to enhance security and user experience.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative experiments with qualitative interviews to explore user interactions with ATMs.

## Data Collection Methods

1. **Surveys**: Assessing user awareness of cognitive biases and security threats.
2. **Experiments**: Testing different ATM interface designs to measure user behavior and decision-making.
3. **Interviews**: Gathering qualitative insights from users about their experiences and perceptions of ATM security.

## Analytical Approaches

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing survey and experimental data to identify patterns and correlations.
2. **Thematic Analysis**: Interpreting qualitative data to uncover common themes related to cognitive security and ATM transactions.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensuring user privacy and informed consent will be paramount, particularly when conducting experiments involving user interactions with ATMs.
