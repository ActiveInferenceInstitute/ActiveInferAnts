# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Cognitive Security Principles into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles into the realm of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. By fusing insights from cognitive security—focused on protecting cognitive processes and information integrity—with the operational framework of ATM transactions, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive model termed "ATM Cognitive Security." This model will address vulnerabilities in user interactions, enhance transaction integrity, and ultimately improve user trust in automated banking systems. The findings are expected to have significant implications for banking practices, user education, and cybersecurity protocols, thereby contributing to a safer and more efficient financial ecosystem.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between cognitive security and ATM transactions. Cognitive security emphasizes safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, while ATM transactions are pivotal in modern banking, characterized by self-service and automated processes. This dissertation will explore how principles from cognitive security can be systematically applied to enhance the integrity and user experience of ATM transactions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of cognitive security principles into ATM transactions is novel, addressing a critical gap in the current understanding of user interactions with automated banking systems. By applying cognitive security frameworks, this research will offer new insights into preventing fraud, enhancing user trust, and improving overall transaction security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be effectively applied to enhance ATM transaction integrity?
2. What is the impact of cognitive biases on user decision-making during ATM transactions?
3. How can user education programs be designed to mitigate cognitive vulnerabilities in ATM usage?
