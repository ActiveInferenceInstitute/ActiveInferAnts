# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Entomology into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of entomology and non-science ways of knowing, creating a Shifted Domain that promises to deepen our understanding of personal and societal transformation. By drawing parallels between the life cycles of insects and human experiences, this research seeks to establish new theoretical constructs, methodologies, and practical applications that can enrich both scientific and non-scientific fields. The potential impact of this work extends to education, community building, emotional intelligence, and ecological awareness, ultimately fostering a more interconnected and resilient society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an intersection between the scientific study of insects (entomology) and holistic, experiential ways of knowing that emphasize culture, intuition, and narrative. This innovative approach recognizes the profound insights that can be garnered from the natural world, particularly through the lens of entomology.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between scientific inquiry and non-scientific understanding. By transposing entomological principles into non-scientific contexts, the dissertation aims to uncover new insights into human behavior, community dynamics, and ecological consciousness.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of entomology inform personal development and community resilience?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of entomology and non-science ways of knowing?
3. In what ways can this Shifted Domain influence educational practices and societal structures?
