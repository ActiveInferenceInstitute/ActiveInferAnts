# Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the Shifted Domain that merges entomology with non-science ways of knowing. By examining the intricate behaviors and ecological roles of insects alongside holistic, intuitive, and cultural perspectives, this research aims to develop innovative frameworks for personal transformation, community dynamics, and communication. The significance of this study lies in its potential to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, enhance emotional intelligence, and promote sustainability. The findings could impact various fields, including psychology, education, and environmental studies, ultimately contributing to a more integrated understanding of human experiences and ecological relationships.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of entomology—the scientific study of insects—and non-science ways of knowing, which encompass holistic, cultural, and intuitive understandings of the world. This integration allows for a richer exploration of personal growth, community dynamics, and communication, drawing parallels between the life cycles of insects and human experiences.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between scientific and non-scientific knowledge, offering a unique perspective on how insights from entomology can inform and enhance non-scientific practices. The novelty lies in the application of entomological principles to personal and societal transformation, potentially revolutionizing educational curricula and community development strategies.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the concept of metamorphosis from entomology serve as a metaphor for personal growth?
2. In what ways can eusocial insect behaviors inform human community dynamics and collaboration?
3. How can insect communication strategies enhance our understanding of non-verbal human communication?
