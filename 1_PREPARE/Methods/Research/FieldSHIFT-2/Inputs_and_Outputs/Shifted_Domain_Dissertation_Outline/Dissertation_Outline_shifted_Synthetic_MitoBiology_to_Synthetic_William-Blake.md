# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and the life and work of William Blake. By transposing concepts from the biological realm into the artistic domain, the research will illuminate the interconnectedness of creativity, energy dynamics, and human experience. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to redefine our understanding of both fields, offering new insights into the nature of creativity, the role of the artist in society, and the biological underpinnings of artistic expression. The findings could significantly impact educational practices, therapeutic approaches in art, and the broader discourse on the relationship between science and art.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of mitochondrial biology, a critical field in cellular and molecular biology, with the artistic and philosophical explorations of William Blake, a seminal figure in Romantic literature and art. Mitochondria are essential for energy production and play a significant role in various cellular processes, while Blake's work delves into themes of duality, spirituality, and the creative spirit. 

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it bridges two seemingly disparate fields, revealing isomorphisms between biological processes and artistic creation. By examining the parallels between mitochondrial dynamics and Blake's exploration of dualities, this dissertation will offer a novel perspective on both biology and art, enhancing our understanding of creativity as a biological and spiritual phenomenon.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can mitochondrial biology inform our understanding of creativity and artistic expression in the context of Blake's work?
2. What are the parallels between mitochondrial dynamics and the dualities explored in Blake's poetry and art?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach contribute to new educational frameworks and practical applications in both fields?
