# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of mitochondrial biology and the life and work of William Blake, creating a Shifted Domain that offers profound insights into both fields. By systematically transposing mitochondrial concepts into the context of Blake's artistic and spiritual explorations, this research seeks to illuminate the dynamic interplay between creativity and societal health. The findings are expected to have significant implications for interdisciplinary studies, educational practices, and cultural discourse, ultimately positioning artists as vital contributors to the collective human experience.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges the biological principles of mitochondria—often referred to as the cell's powerhouses—with the rich, complex themes present in the life and works of William Blake, a pivotal figure in Romantic literature and art. This unique intersection offers a novel perspective on creativity, societal critique, and the human condition.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the sciences and the humanities. By applying biological concepts to artistic and literary analysis, it fosters a new understanding of both fields, revealing how biological processes can inform and enrich our comprehension of artistic expression and societal dynamics.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How does Blake’s creative process mirror mitochondrial energy production in terms of inspiration and output?
2. In what ways can Blake's critique of societal dysfunction be understood through the lens of mitochondrial dysfunction?
3. What parallels exist between the dynamics of mitochondrial biogenesis and the evolution of Blake's artistic style?
