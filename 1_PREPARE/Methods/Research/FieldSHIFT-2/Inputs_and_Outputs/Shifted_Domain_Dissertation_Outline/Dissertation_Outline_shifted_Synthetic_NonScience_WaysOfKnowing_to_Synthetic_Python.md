# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of non-science ways of knowing with Python programming, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes intuitive, narrative-driven, and experiential approaches to coding. By integrating holistic perspectives and subjective experiences into programming practices, this research seeks to redefine how programming is taught, understood, and applied. The potential impact of this work extends beyond educational frameworks, influencing industry practices, policy development, and societal engagement in technology. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both the fields of education and programming, fostering a new generation of developers equipped to tackle complex societal challenges through empathetic and creative solutions.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between non-science ways of knowing—characterized by subjective experience, cultural traditions, and holistic methodologies—and the technical realm of Python programming, known for its simplicity and versatility. This fusion presents an opportunity to enrich programming practices by incorporating diverse epistemological frameworks that value creativity, intuition, and narrative.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
Integrating non-scientific perspectives into programming education and practice challenges the traditional paradigms of coding, which often prioritize empirical and analytical methods. This research is significant as it proposes a paradigm shift that values emotional and experiential understanding, potentially leading to more innovative and human-centered programming practices.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the teaching and learning of Python programming?
2. What are the implications of intuitive and narrative-driven approaches for software development practices?
3. How can the integration of these approaches lead to more empathetic and effective technological solutions?
