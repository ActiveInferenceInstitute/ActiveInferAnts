# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)
PME has evolved through advancements in technology, particularly in data analytics and machine learning, becoming increasingly relevant in fields such as finance, healthcare, and environmental science. Its historical roots can be traced back to early forecasting methods, which have transformed into sophisticated predictive analytics.

### Traditional Knowledge (TK)
Traditional Knowledge has been passed down through generations, reflecting the deep connection between communities and their environments. Its evolution highlights the importance of oral traditions, cultural practices, and ecological observations in shaping community resilience.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### PME
Current trends in PME emphasize the use of big data, machine learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making processes.

### TK
Traditional Knowledge is gaining recognition for its potential contributions to sustainable practices, particularly in environmental management and health. However, it often faces challenges related to marginalization and misrepresentation.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of PME and TK presents opportunities to address existing gaps, such as the need for frameworks that respect and incorporate traditional practices within modern scientific discourse. This Shifted Domain can lead to innovative solutions that enhance resilience and sustainability.
