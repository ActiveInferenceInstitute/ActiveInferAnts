# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing RSA Cryptography to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of RSA cryptography and negotiation, proposing a transformative framework that enhances negotiation strategies through principles of security, trust, and strategic information management. By transposing the core elements of RSA, such as keys, encryption, and digital signatures, into negotiation practices, this research aims to redefine how negotiators approach agreements, fostering deeper trust and protecting interests. The potential impact of this work extends beyond individual negotiations, influencing industries and international relations, and paving the way for future research in both fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of two distinct fields: RSA cryptography, a cornerstone of modern secure communication, and negotiation, a critical process for reaching mutually beneficial agreements. This intersection offers new insights into the mechanics of negotiation, emphasizing security and confidentiality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging cryptographic principles with negotiation strategies to create a robust framework that enhances the efficacy of negotiations. This research addresses existing gaps in negotiation theory by introducing concepts derived from cryptography, thereby enriching both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can RSA cryptographic principles be effectively transposed into negotiation practices?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this transposition?
3. What are the implications of this framework for negotiators in various contexts?
