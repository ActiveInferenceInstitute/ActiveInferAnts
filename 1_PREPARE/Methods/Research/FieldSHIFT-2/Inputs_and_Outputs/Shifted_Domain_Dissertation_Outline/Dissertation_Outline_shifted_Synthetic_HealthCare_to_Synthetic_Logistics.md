# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating healthcare principles into the logistics sector, creating a novel Shifted Domain referred to as "Patient-Centered Logistics." By applying core methodologies from healthcare—such as patient-centered care, continuity of care, and service quality—to logistics operations, this research aims to enhance customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and sustainability. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine logistics practices, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and contribute to a more holistic understanding of service delivery across various sectors. The findings will have implications for both fields, paving the way for innovative solutions to contemporary challenges.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The logistics industry has traditionally focused on the efficient movement and storage of goods, often overlooking the end-user experience. Conversely, healthcare emphasizes patient-centered approaches, prioritizing individual needs and preferences. The fusion of these two domains presents an opportunity to develop logistics practices that are not only efficient but also responsive to customer demands.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms within logistics by introducing healthcare principles that prioritize customer experience. The novelty lies in the application of these principles, creating a new framework for logistics that emphasizes empathy, communication, and sustainability.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can patient-centered care principles be effectively integrated into logistics practices?
2. What impact does the adoption of these principles have on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration, and how can they inform future research?
