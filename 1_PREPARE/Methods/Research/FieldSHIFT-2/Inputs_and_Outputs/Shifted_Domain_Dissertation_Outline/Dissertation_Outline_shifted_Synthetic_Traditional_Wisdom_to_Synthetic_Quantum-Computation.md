# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of Traditional Knowledge and Quantum Computation represents a groundbreaking domain shift that combines centuries of cultural wisdom with the advanced computational capabilities of quantum mechanics. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the practices and beliefs of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainability and holistic understanding. Quantum Computation, on the other hand, utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations that classical computers cannot achieve. This dissertation seeks to explore the synergies between these two distinct fields, offering new insights and methodologies.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in technology and environmental management. By integrating TK, which has historically been marginalized in scientific discourse, with the innovative potential of QC, the dissertation aims to create a more inclusive and effective approach to solving complex ecological and computational problems. The novelty lies in the proposed methodologies that incorporate cultural narratives and sustainable practices into quantum algorithms and systems.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of Traditional Knowledge inform the development of quantum algorithms and technologies?
2. What are the potential applications of a hybrid approach that combines TK with QC in addressing contemporary environmental challenges?
3. In what ways can community engagement enhance the research and application of quantum computing in sustainable practices?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains
Traditional Knowledge has been passed down through generations, embodying the experiences and interactions of indigenous communities with their environments. Quantum Computation emerged in the late 20th century, evolving from theoretical physics into a multidisciplinary field with applications across various domains.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Currently, TK is gaining recognition for its contributions to environmental management, while QC is advancing rapidly in areas such as cryptography, optimization, and complex system modeling. However, the intersection of these two fields remains largely unexplored.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the growing interest in both TK and QC, there is a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that combines these two areas. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by identifying opportunities for collaboration and integration, thereby enhancing the potential impact of both fields.
