# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) from cognitive science into the field of physical security. By establishing a framework that utilizes predictive models and adaptive strategies, the research seeks to enhance the effectiveness of security measures in an increasingly complex threat landscape. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine security protocols, making them more responsive to dynamic environments and ultimately improving safety outcomes. The anticipated impact extends beyond physical security, influencing interdisciplinary fields and fostering innovative approaches to risk management.
