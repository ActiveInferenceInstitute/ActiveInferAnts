# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience in Hospitality to Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience in hospitality and neuroscience, proposing a comprehensive framework that elucidates how principles from one domain can enhance understanding and practices in the other. By investigating the emotional and cognitive dimensions of guest experiences, this research seeks to develop novel hypotheses and methodologies that bridge these fields. The anticipated impact includes advancing educational practices, informing neurotechnology applications, and contributing to interdisciplinary research that addresses complex cognitive and behavioral challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has evolved from providing basic services to creating immersive guest experiences. Concurrently, neuroscience has made significant strides in understanding cognitive processes, emotional engagement, and memory retention. This dissertation posits that the principles of guest experience can inform and enhance neuroscientific research, leading to a deeper understanding of human cognition.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to revolutionize both fields by applying hospitality principles to neuroscience. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that integrates emotional engagement and personalized experiences into cognitive neuroscience, offering fresh insights into learning and memory processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience enhance the understanding of neural processes involved in learning and memory?
2. What methodologies can be developed to measure the impact of emotional engagement on cognitive functions?
3. How can technology integration in hospitality inform neurotechnology applications in educational settings?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Guest Experience:** Historical evolution from service-based to experience-oriented hospitality.
- **Neuroscience:** Development from basic neuroanatomy to advanced cognitive neuroscience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Guest Experience:** Focus on personalization, technology integration, and emotional engagement.
- **Neuroscience:** Emphasis on neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and emotional processing.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research connecting emotional engagement in hospitality to cognitive neuroscience.
- Opportunities to develop new frameworks and methodologies that merge insights from both fields.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Guest Experience Theories:** Service profit chain, co-creation, and moment of truth.
- **Neuroscience Theories:** Neural network theory, synaptic plasticity, and emotional processing models.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Experience-Cognition Nexus:** A framework linking guest experiences to cognitive processes.
- **Emotional Engagement Model:** A model exploring the effects of emotional connections on learning and memory.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that maps the guest experience journey to cognitive processes, illustrating how emotional engagement influences neural pathways.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersections of guest experience and neuroscience.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with hospitality professionals and neuroscientists.
