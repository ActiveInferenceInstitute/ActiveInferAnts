# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from ATM Transactions to RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of ATM transaction processes and RSA cryptography, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes user-centric security protocols. By analyzing the transaction flow of ATMs and integrating user experience principles into RSA encryption, this research aims to enhance the usability, accessibility, and security of cryptographic systems. The findings have the potential to revolutionize the field of cryptography, making secure communication more intuitive and adaptable to user needs, while also informing the design of future financial and security technologies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the convergence of two distinct fields: ATM transactions, which focus on user autonomy and real-time financial operations, and RSA cryptography, which underpins secure digital communication. This intersection presents an opportunity to rethink traditional cryptographic practices by incorporating user experience and transaction flow principles from the banking sector.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional view of cryptography as a purely mathematical domain. By emphasizing user-centric design, it opens new avenues for enhancing security and accessibility in cryptographic systems. This novel approach has the potential to reshape how both fields interact, leading to improved user engagement and security practices.
