# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle into Prediction Matter Expertise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) into Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By leveraging the theoretical constructs of FEP, this research aims to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making processes across disciplines. The significance lies in its potential to redefine how knowledge is synthesized and applied in real-world scenarios, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. This work will contribute to both theoretical advancements and practical applications, paving the way for future research and educational initiatives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a framework for understanding how adaptive systems, including biological organisms, minimize variational free energy to maintain stability. In contrast, Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) focuses on the ability to synthesize knowledge across disciplines to make informed predictions. This dissertation seeks to fuse these two domains, exploring how principles from FEP can enhance the predictive capabilities and decision-making processes within PME.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical predictive analytics. By applying FEP concepts to PME, this dissertation will introduce novel frameworks and methodologies that can transform decision-making in complex, uncertain environments. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of FEP principles into PME, offering a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary knowledge synthesis.
