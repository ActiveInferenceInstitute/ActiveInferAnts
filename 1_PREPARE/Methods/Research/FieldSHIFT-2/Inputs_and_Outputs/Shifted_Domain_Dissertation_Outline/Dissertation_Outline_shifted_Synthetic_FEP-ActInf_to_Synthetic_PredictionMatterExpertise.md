# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Prediction Matter Expertise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Prediction Matter Expertise (PME), creating a novel framework termed Predictive Matter Expertise (PME-FEP). This interdisciplinary approach seeks to enhance our understanding of prediction and decision-making by applying biological principles of adaptation to human expertise across various domains. The research will provide valuable insights into improving predictive accuracy, decision-making processes, and organizational resilience. The findings are expected to have significant implications for academia, industry, and policy-making, promoting a more integrated approach to knowledge synthesis and adaptive learning.

## Introduction
