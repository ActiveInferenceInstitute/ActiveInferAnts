# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of neural network principles with mitochondrial function, establishing a Shifted Domain that promises to revolutionize our understanding of cellular metabolism and resilience. By identifying isomorphisms between these two previously distinct fields, the research will articulate a new theoretical framework that posits mitochondria as dynamic, interconnected networks analogous to neural circuits. The potential impact of this research extends beyond theoretical advancements, offering practical applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and educational methodologies, thereby influencing both the scientific community and society at large.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Neural networks and mitochondrial function represent two critical domains in biology, each with its own complexities and challenges. Neural networks are characterized by their interconnectivity, plasticity, and hierarchical processing, while mitochondria are known for their roles in energy production, metabolic regulation, and cellular signaling. This dissertation seeks to synthesize these domains, proposing that mitochondrial networks can be conceptualized similarly to neural circuits.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to uncover new insights into mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in relation to energy metabolism and cellular signaling. By applying concepts from neural networks to mitochondrial function, this work aims to fill existing gaps in both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How do mitochondrial networks adapt to changes in cellular energy demands?
- What mechanisms underlie mitochondrial plasticity in response to metabolic stress?
- How do mitochondrial dynamics influence cellular signaling and decision-making processes?
The objective is to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates neural network concepts into mitochondrial biology, leading to novel hypotheses and experimental designs.
