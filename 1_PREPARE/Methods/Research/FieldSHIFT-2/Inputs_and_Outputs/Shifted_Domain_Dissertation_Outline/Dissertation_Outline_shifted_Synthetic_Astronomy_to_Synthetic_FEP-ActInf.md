# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Astronomy into the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of astronomy and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through the lens of active inference. By transposing astronomical phenomena into the framework of adaptive systems, this research aims to develop a novel theoretical model that enhances our understanding of celestial behavior as dynamic and predictive. The potential impact of this work lies in redefining how we interpret cosmic events, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and paving the way for practical applications in both fields.
