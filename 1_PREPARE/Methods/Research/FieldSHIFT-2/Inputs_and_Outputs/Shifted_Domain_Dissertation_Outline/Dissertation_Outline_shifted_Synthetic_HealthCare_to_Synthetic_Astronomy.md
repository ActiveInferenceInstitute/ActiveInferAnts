# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating health care principles into the field of astronomy, a Shifted Domain that merges two traditionally distinct fields. By examining the parallels between patient experience in health care and observational experience in astronomy, this research aims to enhance public engagement with astronomical data and improve data quality standards. The proposed framework emphasizes user-centered design, quality assurance in data collection, and the integration of advanced technologies, including AI. The findings are expected to revolutionize both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and creating new opportunities for research and societal impact.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of health care and astronomy, two fields that have historically operated in silos. Health care focuses on patient-centered approaches, service quality, and technology integration to enhance care delivery. Conversely, astronomy is centered around the study of celestial phenomena, often relying on complex data analysis and observational techniques. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by applying health care principles to astronomical research and public engagement.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape how both fields approach their respective challenges. By adopting a patient-centered lens in astronomy, we can enhance the experience of scientists and the public when interacting with astronomical data. Novel contributions include the development of a new theoretical framework that prioritizes user experience and data quality, as well as the introduction of innovative methodologies for data collection and analysis.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can patient-centered approaches from health care be effectively transposed to enhance user experience in astronomy?
2. What quality assurance frameworks can be developed to ensure the reliability of astronomical data?
3. How can technology, particularly AI, be leveraged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of astronomical research?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Health Care
The evolution of health care has transitioned from paternalistic models to collaborative frameworks that emphasize patient autonomy and shared decision-making. Key milestones include the introduction of evidence-based practice and the rise of telemedicine.

### Astronomy
Astronomy has evolved from ancient observational practices to sophisticated scientific methodologies, including the use of telescopes, spectroscopy, and computational models. The field continues to grapple with challenges related to data quality and the interpretation of complex cosmic phenomena.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Health Care
Current trends in health care emphasize personalized medicine, telehealth, and the integration of AI to enhance patient outcomes. The focus is increasingly on sustainability and community health initiatives.

### Astronomy
In astronomy, current research trends focus on the study of dark matter, dark energy, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Emerging technologies are enhancing observational capacities, but challenges remain in data management and public engagement.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of health care and astronomy presents unique opportunities to address existing gaps in both fields. The lack of user-centered design in astronomical data platforms and the need for rigorous data quality standards are critical areas for exploration.
