# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Prediction Matter Expertise into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into the realm of guest experience in hospitality. By establishing a novel framework termed Predictive Guest Experience (PGE), the research will investigate how predictive analytics, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and real-time feedback systems can enhance guest satisfaction and loyalty. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine service quality metrics and operational strategies in the hospitality industry, ultimately leading to a more personalized and innovative guest experience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on guest-centric approaches that prioritize personal interactions and service quality. However, with the rise of data analytics and predictive modeling, there is an unprecedented opportunity to enhance guest experiences through informed decision-making. The marriage of PME, which emphasizes interdisciplinary integration and continuous learning, with guest experience paradigms presents a groundbreaking shift in how hospitality services are delivered.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a systematic approach to leveraging predictive analytics in hospitality, an area that has been underexplored. By applying principles from PME to guest experience, the study aims to fill existing gaps in knowledge and practice, offering a fresh perspective on service innovation and quality enhancement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can predictive analytics be effectively integrated into the guest experience lifecycle?
- What impacts do cross-functional teams have on service innovation in hospitality?
- How does feedback-driven adaptation influence guest satisfaction and loyalty?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The origins of PME can be traced back to disciplines such as data science, psychology, and business analytics, which emphasize predictive modeling and decision-making. Conversely, guest experience in hospitality has evolved from basic service delivery to a complex interplay of personalization, technology, and sustainability.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
While PME has established methodologies for prediction and analysis, the hospitality sector has focused primarily on qualitative measures of guest satisfaction. Recent trends indicate a growing interest in utilizing data-driven approaches, yet comprehensive frameworks integrating these insights remain scarce.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The intersection of these two fields reveals significant gaps in understanding how predictive analytics can enhance guest experiences. Opportunities lie in developing frameworks that integrate data analysis with service design, ultimately leading to innovative solutions for guest engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Predictive Analytics Theory:** Focuses on the use of historical data to make informed predictions about future events.
- **Service Quality Theory:** Emphasizes the dimensions of service quality, including reliability, assurance, and empathy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Predictive Guest Experience Framework:** A theoretical model that combines predictive analytics with guest experience management to enhance service delivery.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines insights from both domains, highlighting the synergy between predictive analytics and guest-centric service delivery.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative case studies to explore the integration of PME into hospitality.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** To gather quantitative data on guest satisfaction and preferences.
- **Interviews:** Conduct qualitative interviews with hospitality professionals to gather insights on service innovation and predictive practices.
- **Case Studies:** Analyze successful implementations of predictive analytics in hospitality settings.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilize statistical tools to analyze survey data and identify trends.
- **Thematic Analysis:** Apply thematic analysis to interview transcripts to extract key insights.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure participant confidentiality, informed consent, and data protection in accordance with ethical research guidelines.
