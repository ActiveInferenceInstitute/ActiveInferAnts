# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Guest Experience Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Guest Experience Management (GEM), creating a new paradigm for enhancing guest interactions in the hospitality industry. By leveraging predictive analytics, cross-disciplinary training, and anticipatory service models, this research seeks to address contemporary challenges in guest satisfaction, operational efficiency, and service personalization. The anticipated impact of this research spans across academic, industry, and societal domains, offering a comprehensive framework for transforming guest experiences through data-driven insights and innovative methodologies.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of PME and GEM, where analytical rigor and intuitive understanding coalesce to redefine how hospitality businesses engage with guests. This integration is driven by advancements in data science, machine learning, and evolving consumer expectations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it fills a critical gap in the hospitality industry by applying predictive analytics to enhance guest experiences. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of PME principles into GEM, fostering a proactive approach to service delivery that anticipates guest needs rather than merely responding to them.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can predictive analytics be effectively integrated into guest experience management to enhance guest satisfaction?
2. What are the implications of cross-disciplinary training for hospitality staff in improving service delivery?
3. How can continuous feedback loops be utilized to create a more adaptive service environment?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Prediction Matter Expertise (PME):** Originating from systems thinking and decision theory, PME has evolved with advancements in data analytics and interdisciplinary collaboration.
- **Guest Experience Management (GEM):** GEM has developed as a response to the increasing importance of customer satisfaction in the hospitality sector, shaped by contemporary trends in service quality and personalization.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- PME emphasizes a holistic, data-driven approach to decision-making.
- GEM focuses on enhancing guest interactions through service quality, personalization, and technology integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There exists a gap in the application of predictive methodologies within GEM. This research will explore how PME can inform and enhance GEM practices, offering new insights into service delivery.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Decision Theory:** Provides insights into how decisions are made under uncertainty.
- **Service Quality Models:** Frameworks like SERVQUAL assess service delivery effectiveness.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Predictive Guest Profiling (PGP):** A new construct that utilizes data analytics to create comprehensive guest profiles.
- **Anticipatory Service Delivery (ASD):** A proactive approach to service that focuses on anticipating guest needs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The dissertation will propose an integrated model that combines PME principles with GEM practices, highlighting the interplay between data-driven insights and service personalization.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative analyses of guest satisfaction metrics with qualitative interviews of hospitality staff and guests.

### Data Collection Methods
1. Surveys and questionnaires to gather quantitative data on guest satisfaction.
2. Interviews and focus groups with hospitality staff to understand the impact of predictive analytics.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data using regression models.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
The research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, data privacy, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time.
