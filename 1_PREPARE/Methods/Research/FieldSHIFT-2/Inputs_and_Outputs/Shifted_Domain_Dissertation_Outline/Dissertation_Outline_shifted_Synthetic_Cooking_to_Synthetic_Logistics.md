# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary concepts and logistics, proposing a transformative framework that leverages principles from the culinary arts to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in logistics. By investigating the parallels between cooking practices and logistics processes, this research seeks to develop novel theories, models, and methodologies that can be applied in the logistics sector. The potential impact of this research is profound, as it not only redefines traditional logistics practices but also paves the way for interdisciplinary collaborations and advancements in both fields.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of culinary arts and logistics, two fields that have historically operated independently. Culinary arts focus on the preparation, presentation, and enjoyment of food, while logistics emphasizes the efficient movement and storage of goods. This dissertation will explore how culinary principles can inform and enhance logistics practices, ultimately leading to more efficient and customer-centric operations.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges conventional boundaries between disciplines, illustrating how insights from one field can lead to innovative practices in another. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of culinary concepts into logistics, offering a fresh perspective that has not been extensively explored in academic literature.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can culinary principles such as mise en place and flavor profiles be effectively integrated into logistics operations?
2. What operational techniques derived from culinary practices can enhance logistics efficiency?
3. How does understanding demand seasonality through the lens of ingredient availability improve inventory management in logistics?
4. What new theories and models can be developed to illustrate the relationship between culinary arts and logistics?
