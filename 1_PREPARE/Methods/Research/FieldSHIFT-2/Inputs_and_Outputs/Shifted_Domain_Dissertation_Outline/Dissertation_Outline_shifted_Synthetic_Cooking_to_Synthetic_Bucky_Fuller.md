# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts into Buckminster Fuller’s Design Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary arts and design philosophy as articulated by Buckminster Fuller. By transposing culinary principles into design thinking, this research seeks to uncover new methodologies, frameworks, and applications that enhance sustainability, creativity, and functionality in design practices. The study will contribute to both fields by developing a Culinary Design Model that integrates flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and project management principles into the design process, ultimately fostering a holistic approach to problem-solving. The potential impact of this research extends to education, industry practices, and societal well-being, creating a more interconnected and sustainable future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of culinary concepts and design philosophy presents a novel approach to understanding how interdisciplinary practices can lead to innovative solutions. Culinary arts, with their emphasis on transformation, balance, and sensory experience, can provide valuable insights into design processes traditionally dominated by engineering and aesthetics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional boundaries between culinary arts and design, proposing that principles from one domain can enhance the other. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of culinary methods into design thinking, offering a fresh perspective on sustainability and creativity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary principles inform sustainable design practices?
2. In what ways can iterative design processes be likened to culinary fermentation?
3. What new frameworks and models can be developed to integrate these two domains effectively?
