# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts into the Framework of Buckminster Fuller’s Design Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary arts and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes sustainability, systemic thinking, and innovative practices in cuisine. By analyzing the core principles of both fields, this research will articulate a new framework for culinary practices that prioritize resource efficiency, holistic systems thinking, and emergent culinary experiences. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing culinary education, industry practices, and societal attitudes toward sustainability and interconnectedness.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The culinary arts have traditionally focused on flavor, presentation, and cultural significance. In contrast, Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy emphasizes holistic thinking, resource efficiency, and systems-oriented solutions. This dissertation seeks to merge these distinct domains, creating a framework that applies Fuller's principles to culinary practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers a new interdisciplinary approach that reimagines culinary arts through the lens of design science. It offers an opportunity to develop sustainable culinary practices that resonate with contemporary global challenges, such as climate change and food security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s design principles inform and transform culinary practices?
2. What are the emergent properties of culinary systems when viewed through a synergetic lens?
3. How can innovative culinary practices promote sustainability and interconnectedness in food systems?

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model that combines culinary arts with Fuller's design principles, emphasizing sustainability, resource efficiency, and emergent culinary experiences.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersection of culinary arts and design philosophy.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Qualitative:** Interviews with chefs, food scientists, and design professionals; focus groups with culinary students.
- **Quantitative:** Surveys measuring consumer perceptions of sustainable culinary practices; sensory evaluations of dishes.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for quantitative data, utilizing software such as SPSS or R.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and adhering to ethical guidelines in culinary experimentation.
