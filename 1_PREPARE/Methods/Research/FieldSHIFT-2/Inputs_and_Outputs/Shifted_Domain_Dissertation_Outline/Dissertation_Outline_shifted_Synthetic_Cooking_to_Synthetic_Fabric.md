# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Principles into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary arts and textile design, termed the Shifted Domain. By examining the core principles of cuisine and their application to fabric production and design, this research seeks to establish a new theoretical framework that enhances creativity, sustainability, and cultural expression in the fabric industry. The potential impact includes the development of unique textiles that evoke sensory experiences akin to culinary delights, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. This research will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also provide practical applications for industry professionals and educators.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The culinary arts and fabric design have traditionally existed as separate disciplines, each with its own set of principles, techniques, and cultural significance. However, recent trends towards sustainability and personalization in both fields have prompted a reevaluation of their boundaries. This dissertation proposes a systematic transposition of culinary principles into the fabric industry, creating a novel framework for design and production.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize textile design by integrating sensory experiences derived from culinary practices. This novel approach not only enhances the aesthetic and tactile qualities of fabrics but also promotes sustainable practices and cultural diversity. 

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can culinary principles be systematically transposed into textile design?
- What are the implications of this transposition for creativity, sustainability, and cultural expression in the fabric industry?
