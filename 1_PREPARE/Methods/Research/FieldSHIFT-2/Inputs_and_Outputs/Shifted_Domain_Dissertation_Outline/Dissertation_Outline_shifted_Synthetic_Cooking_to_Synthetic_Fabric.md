# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Cuisine to the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the culinary arts and the fabric industry, proposing a framework that integrates culinary principles into textile design. By examining how flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and ingredient selection can inform fabric aesthetics, construction, and sustainability, this research seeks to create a new paradigm for both fields. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic discourse, influencing industry practices, consumer behavior, and cultural appreciation. Through a systematic analysis of the synergies between these domains, the dissertation will contribute to the development of a more sustainable, culturally rich, and innovative fabric industry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of cuisine and the fabric industry represents a novel approach to understanding the cultural and sensory experiences associated with both fields. Cuisine, with its rich history and evolving practices, serves as a metaphor for creativity and cultural expression, while the fabric industry grapples with sustainability and ethical production.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to redefine textile design by applying culinary concepts. By drawing parallels between the two domains, the dissertation will uncover new methodologies that can enhance the aesthetic and functional qualities of textiles while promoting sustainable practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can culinary principles inform the design and production processes in the fabric industry?
- What are the implications of integrating flavor profiles and cooking techniques into textile design?
- In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach foster sustainability and cultural appreciation in both fields?
