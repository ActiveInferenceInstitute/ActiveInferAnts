# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating traditional knowledge (TK) into the field of astronomy. By examining the intersections between these two distinct domains, the research seeks to establish a comprehensive framework that enhances our understanding of celestial phenomena while promoting sustainable practices and cultural appreciation. The significance of this research lies in its ability to bridge the gap between indigenous wisdom and modern scientific methodologies, ultimately contributing to a more holistic understanding of the universe and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of traditional knowledge and astronomy represents a novel domain that emphasizes the value of indigenous perspectives in understanding celestial phenomena. Traditional knowledge, characterized by its holistic approach and sustainable practices, has much to offer to the empirical and quantitative nature of astronomy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it challenges the conventional boundaries of scientific inquiry by advocating for the inclusion of diverse cultural perspectives. By recognizing the value of traditional knowledge, this dissertation aims to redefine the methodologies and practices within astronomy, promoting sustainability and ecological stewardship.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can traditional knowledge enhance our understanding of celestial navigation and star mapping?
2. What sustainable practices in astronomy can be informed by traditional ecological knowledge?
3. How can cultural astronomy provide new insights into the significance of celestial events in shaping cultural narratives?
