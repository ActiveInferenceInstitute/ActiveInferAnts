# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation theory and neuroscience, termed the "Neural Negotiation Theory." By examining how the principles of negotiation can inform our understanding of neural processes, this research seeks to generate new insights into communication, decision-making, and emotional regulation. This work holds the potential to revolutionize both fields, offering practical applications in education, industry, and societal interactions. The dissertation will contribute to the development of a new theoretical framework, methodologies for interdisciplinary research, and a comprehensive understanding of the neural underpinnings of negotiation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation is a fundamental human activity that involves dialogue, relationship-building, and strategic decision-making. Neuroscience, on the other hand, provides insights into the biological basis of behavior and cognitive processes. This dissertation posits that understanding negotiation through a neuroscientific lens can yield new perspectives on both communication and cognitive functioning.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers an interdisciplinary approach that merges negotiation theory with neuroscience. By identifying isomorphisms between the two domains, the dissertation will reveal how neural mechanisms can inform negotiation strategies and vice versa. This novel perspective has the potential to advance both fields and generate innovative applications.
