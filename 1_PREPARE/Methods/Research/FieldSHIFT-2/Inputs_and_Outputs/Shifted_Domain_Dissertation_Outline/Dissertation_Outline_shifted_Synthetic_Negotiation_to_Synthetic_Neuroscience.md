# PhD Dissertation Plan: Negotiation in the Context of Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection of negotiation and neuroscience, proposing a novel framework termed Neural Negotiation Theory (NNT). By transposing principles from negotiation into the realm of neuroscience, the research seeks to redefine our understanding of cognitive processes, decision-making, and human interactions. This interdisciplinary approach promises significant implications for both fields, enhancing educational methodologies, informing technological advancements, and providing insights into mental health disorders characterized by impaired decision-making. The research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural underpinnings of negotiation and its broader societal impacts.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation, a fundamental aspect of human interaction, has traditionally been studied within the realms of social science and business. Concurrently, neuroscience has sought to unravel the complexities of the brain and its influence on behavior. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, examining how negotiation principles can inform our understanding of neural processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of negotiation concepts into neuroscience offers a fresh perspective on cognitive behavior, framing decision-making as a negotiation among competing neural circuits. This innovative approach not only enriches the theoretical landscape of both fields but also presents practical applications that can enhance negotiation strategies and mental health interventions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be applied to understand neural processes involved in decision-making?
2. What are the neural correlates of negotiation dynamics, and how do emotional states influence them?
3. How can insights from NNT inform educational practices and technological innovations?
