# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Patient Experience in Healthcare

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into patient experience frameworks in healthcare. By identifying isomorphisms between these two domains, the research seeks to develop a comprehensive model that enhances patient satisfaction, improves health outcomes, and fosters a holistic approach to care. The study will provide actionable insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and educators, ultimately contributing to a paradigm shift in how healthcare services are delivered and perceived.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain focuses on the intersection of guest experience in hospitality and patient experience in healthcare. Both fields prioritize service quality, personalization, and the physical environment's impact on user satisfaction. However, the application of hospitality principles in healthcare remains underexplored, presenting a unique opportunity for innovation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on patient care. By applying hospitality-driven strategies to healthcare, the study aims to enhance patient engagement, satisfaction, and overall wellness, thereby addressing critical gaps in current healthcare delivery models.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be effectively transposed to enhance patient experience in healthcare?
- What are the key isomorphic elements between the two domains that can inform best practices?
- What frameworks can be developed to measure and improve patient experience based on hospitality standards?
