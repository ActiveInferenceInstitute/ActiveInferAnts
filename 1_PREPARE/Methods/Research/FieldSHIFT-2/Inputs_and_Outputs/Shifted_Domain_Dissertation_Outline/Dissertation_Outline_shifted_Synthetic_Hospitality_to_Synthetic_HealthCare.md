# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing guest experience principles from the hospitality industry to patient experience in healthcare. By integrating concepts such as personalization, emotional engagement, and holistic service delivery, this research will provide a comprehensive framework for enhancing patient care. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, improve patient satisfaction, and foster better health outcomes. Through a systematic examination of both domains, this dissertation will offer actionable insights and a roadmap for implementing these principles in healthcare settings.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion between the hospitality and healthcare sectors, two industries traditionally viewed as distinct. The guest experience in hospitality emphasizes personalized service, emotional connections, and seamless interactions, while the patient experience in healthcare focuses on patient-centered care and continuity of care. This dissertation will investigate how principles from hospitality can be effectively applied to enhance patient experiences in healthcare.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two fields that have not been systematically integrated before. By leveraging the strengths of the hospitality industry, this dissertation proposes a novel approach to understanding and improving patient experiences. The findings have the potential to influence policy, practice, and education within healthcare, paving the way for a more compassionate and effective system.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be transposed to enhance patient experience in healthcare?
2. What are the underlying isomorphisms between the two domains that can inform best practices in patient care?
3. How can technology be utilized to facilitate this transposition and improve patient engagement?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

This section will provide a historical overview of the evolution of guest experience in hospitality and patient experience in healthcare, highlighting key milestones and shifts in focus.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An analysis of current literature will reveal the state of knowledge in both hospitality and healthcare, focusing on existing frameworks, methodologies, and best practices.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This section will identify gaps in the current literature, particularly the lack of interdisciplinary research that connects hospitality principles with healthcare practices, presenting opportunities for innovation.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

This section will discuss key theories from hospitality (e.g., service quality models) and healthcare (e.g., patient-centered care frameworks) that will inform the research.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The dissertation will propose new theoretical constructs that emerge from the integration of both domains, focusing on holistic patient journeys and emotional service quality.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate how the principles from both domains can work synergistically to enhance patient experience.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods to capture a comprehensive view of patient experiences.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and observational studies in various healthcare settings, focusing on patient interactions and experiences.

## Analytical Approaches

Statistical analyses, thematic coding, and comparative case studies will be utilized to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations, including informed consent and confidentiality, will be addressed throughout the research process.
