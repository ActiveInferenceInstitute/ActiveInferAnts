# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from RxInfer.jl (Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference) to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference concepts from the RxInfer.jl framework into the guest experience in the hospitality industry. By leveraging advanced data analytics, this research seeks to enhance service delivery, personalize guest interactions, and improve operational efficiencies. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine guest experience management, creating a paradigm shift that not only benefits hospitality practitioners but also contributes to the academic discourse in both fields. The outcomes of this research will provide a robust framework for future studies and practical applications, ultimately leading to a more data-informed, guest-centric hospitality sector.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry is undergoing a significant transformation driven by changing guest expectations, technological advancements, and the need for personalized experiences. Simultaneously, probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, as exemplified by RxInfer.jl, offer powerful tools for modeling uncertainty and making informed decisions based on data. This dissertation explores the intersection of these domains, proposing a novel framework that integrates probabilistic methodologies into hospitality management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to applying complex probabilistic models to enhance guest experiences. By transposing concepts from RxInfer.jl into hospitality, the study addresses critical challenges such as service consistency, personalization, and operational efficiency. The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical contributions; they offer practical solutions that can be implemented in real-world settings.
