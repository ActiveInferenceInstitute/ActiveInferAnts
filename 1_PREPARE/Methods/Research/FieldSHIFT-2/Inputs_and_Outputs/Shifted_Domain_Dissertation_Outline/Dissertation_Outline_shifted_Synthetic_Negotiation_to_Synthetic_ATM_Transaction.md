# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation to ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and ATM transactions, proposing a transformative framework that enhances user experience and operational efficiency. By applying negotiation strategies to the design and functionality of ATMs, this research seeks to redefine user engagement, promote personalized interactions, and address existing challenges in the ATM landscape. The outcomes of this study have the potential to revolutionize the self-service banking experience, foster deeper customer relationships, and inspire further interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of negotiation methodologies and ATM transactions represents a novel research area that leverages insights from interpersonal communication and user experience design. Negotiation, traditionally confined to human interactions, can inform the development of more intuitive and responsive ATM interfaces.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges the conventional view of ATMs as static transactional machines. By integrating negotiation principles, this study introduces a dynamic interaction model that prioritizes user needs and preferences, thereby enhancing satisfaction and engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into ATM transaction processes?
2. What impact do negotiation-informed interfaces have on user satisfaction and transaction efficiency?
3. What are the broader implications of this integration for the fields of user experience design and financial technology?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
Negotiation has evolved from informal bargaining to a structured discipline, while ATM technology has progressed from basic cash dispensing to multifunctional banking solutions. Understanding the historical context of both fields is crucial for identifying their intersections.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature on negotiation emphasizes emotional intelligence and technology's role in mediating interactions. In contrast, research on ATMs focuses on usability, security, and user experience. A synthesis of these bodies of knowledge reveals opportunities for innovation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements in both fields, there is limited exploration of how negotiation strategies can enhance automated transactions. This gap presents a unique opportunity for research that bridges these domains.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
1. **Negotiation Theory:** Emphasizes the importance of understanding interests, building relationships, and achieving win-win outcomes.
2. **User-Centered Design:** Focuses on creating interfaces that prioritize user needs and enhance usability.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The integration of negotiation principles into ATM transactions creates a new theoretical framework that combines adaptive interaction, user engagement, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This model posits that ATMs can function as negotiation partners, employing dialogue-based interfaces that adapt to user inputs and preferences, thereby fostering a more engaging and satisfying transaction experience.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to assess the impact of negotiation-informed interfaces on user experience.

### Data Collection Methods
1. **User Surveys:** To gather qualitative feedback on user experiences with traditional and negotiation-informed ATMs.
2. **Experimental Trials:** To quantitatively measure transaction efficiency and satisfaction levels in controlled settings.

### Analytical Approaches
Data will be analyzed using statistical methods to evaluate the effectiveness of negotiation-informed interfaces compared to traditional designs. Qualitative data will be coded and thematically analyzed.

### Ethical Considerations
The research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent from participants and safeguarding their privacy during data collection and analysis.
