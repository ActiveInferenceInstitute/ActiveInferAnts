# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Exercise into the Context of Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating exercise science with neuroscience, a newly shifted domain that promises to enhance our understanding of the brain-body connection. The research will investigate how physical activity influences neural function, cognitive performance, and mental health, ultimately proposing a novel framework for considering exercise as a therapeutic intervention for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both fields, potentially leading to new interdisciplinary practices, policies, and educational approaches.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of exercise and neuroscience represents a paradigm shift in understanding health and wellness. Historically viewed as separate disciplines, recent research suggests that physical activity may play a crucial role in brain health, cognitive function, and mental well-being. This dissertation will elucidate the mechanisms through which exercise influences neuroplasticity, synaptic strength, and overall cognitive resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of exercise solely as a physical endeavor, highlighting its cognitive and neuroprotective benefits. By synthesizing knowledge from both fields, it proposes innovative interventions that could revolutionize mental health treatment and cognitive enhancement strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How does exercise influence neuroplasticity and cognitive function?
2. What are the molecular mechanisms linking physical activity to brain health?
3. How can exercise be effectively integrated into therapeutic interventions for neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders?
