By integrating Fuller's design science with biological principles, this dissertation proposes a new paradigm that prioritizes holistic approaches to ecosystem management. This research is novel in its interdisciplinary nature, bridging gaps between design, ecology, and sustainability, and proposing innovative frameworks that can lead to more resilient and adaptable ecosystems.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller’s principles of design science, synergetics, and tensegrity be applied to the study of ecosystems?
2. What novel hypotheses emerge from the integration of these principles into ecological frameworks?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform sustainable practices and policies in biodiversity conservation and resource management?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains
Buckminster Fuller’s work emerged in the mid-20th century, focusing on innovative design solutions to global challenges. His principles have influenced various fields, including architecture, engineering, and environmental science. In parallel, the field of biology has evolved, with increasing recognition of ecosystems as complex, dynamic systems that require holistic understanding.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current ecological research often emphasizes reductionist approaches, focusing on individual species or components. However, there is a growing acknowledgment of the need for systems thinking in ecology, which aligns with Fuller's holistic principles. Despite this, there remains a lack of integrated frameworks that effectively merge these two domains.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of Fuller's concepts with ecological science presents opportunities to address existing gaps in ecological modeling, particularly regarding emergent properties and resilience. This research aims to fill these gaps by developing a new theoretical framework that incorporates holistic design principles into ecosystem management.
