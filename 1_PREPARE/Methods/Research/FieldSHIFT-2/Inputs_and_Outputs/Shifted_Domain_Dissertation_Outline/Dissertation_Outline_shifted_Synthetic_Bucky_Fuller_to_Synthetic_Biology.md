# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s design principles and the field of biology and ecosystems. By transposing Fuller's concepts—such as holistic thinking, ephemeralization, synergetics, and tensegrity—into ecological contexts, this research seeks to develop a novel theoretical framework that enhances our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and resilience. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize conservation strategies and sustainability practices, fostering a more integrated approach to managing the planet's resources. Ultimately, this dissertation will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and advancements in ecological management.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a unique fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s design principles and biological sciences, particularly ecology. Fuller, a visionary thinker, advocated for a holistic understanding of systems and sustainable practices through his various concepts. Meanwhile, biology and ecology focus on understanding living systems, their interactions, and the challenges they face in a rapidly changing world. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two realms, creating a comprehensive framework that applies Fuller's insights to ecological management.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to transform how we approach ecosystem management. By integrating Fuller's holistic design philosophy with ecological principles, we can develop innovative conservation strategies that promote resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. The novelty of this work lies in its interdisciplinary approach, offering fresh perspectives on longstanding ecological challenges and fostering a new lexicon for understanding these complex systems.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s principles be effectively transposed into ecological contexts to enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration, and how can they inform conservation strategies?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach lead to practical applications in biodiversity management and sustainable practices?
