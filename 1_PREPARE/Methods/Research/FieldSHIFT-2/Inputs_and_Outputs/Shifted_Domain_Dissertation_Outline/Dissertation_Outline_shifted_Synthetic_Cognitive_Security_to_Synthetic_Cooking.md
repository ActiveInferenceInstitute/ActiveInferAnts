# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive security and cuisine, proposing a transformative framework that prioritizes the integrity of culinary information and combats misinformation in dietary practices. By examining the parallels between cognitive biases in information processing and flavor perception, the research seeks to establish new theoretical constructs and practical applications that enhance culinary literacy and integrity. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic contributions, influencing food education, policy, and societal health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of cognitive security and cuisine represents a novel domain where cognitive processes intersect with culinary practices. Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding mental processes from misinformation, while cuisine encompasses cultural and regional cooking practices. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, addressing the growing concerns around culinary misinformation and the integrity of food choices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in both cognitive security and culinary studies. By applying cognitive security principles to culinary practices, the dissertation introduces an innovative lens through which to examine food integrity and misinformation. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches both fields but also offers practical solutions to contemporary challenges in dietary decision-making.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can cognitive security principles be effectively transposed into the culinary domain to enhance food integrity?
- What are the cognitive biases that influence culinary preferences and how do they contribute to the spread of culinary misinformation?
- What interdisciplinary strategies can be developed to promote culinary literacy and combat misinformation in dietary choices?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cognitive Security:** Overview of its development, key theories, and methodologies used to combat misinformation.
- **Cuisine:** Examination of the evolution of culinary practices, cultural significance, and the impact of globalization on traditional cuisines.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of recent advancements in cognitive security, particularly in AI and misinformation detection.
- Review of contemporary culinary studies, focusing on trends, fusion cuisines, and challenges related to misinformation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary research connecting cognitive security and culinary practices.
- Exploration of opportunities for developing frameworks that enhance culinary integrity and consumer awareness.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Cognitive Security Theories:** Social engineering, cognitive biases, and misinformation frameworks.
- **Culinary Theories:** Cultural anthropology of food, flavor perception, and culinary traditions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Introduction of concepts like "Culinary Integrity" and "Flavor Literacy" as frameworks for understanding the integrity of culinary information.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that illustrates the interaction between cognitive biases, culinary misinformation, and consumer decision-making.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersection of cognitive security and cuisine.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with culinary professionals and consumers to assess perceptions of culinary misinformation.
- Content analysis of culinary media to identify prevalent misinformation and cognitive biases.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between cognitive biases and culinary preferences.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to derive insights into consumer attitudes towards culinary integrity.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from participants and addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis.
