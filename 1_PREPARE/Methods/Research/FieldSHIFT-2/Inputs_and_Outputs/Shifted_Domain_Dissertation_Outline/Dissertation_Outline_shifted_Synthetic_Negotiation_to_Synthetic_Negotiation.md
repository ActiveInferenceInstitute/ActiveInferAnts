# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Principles from Domain A (Negotiation) to Domain B (Negotiation)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles from Domain A into Domain B, thereby creating a novel framework for collaborative negotiation. The significance of this research lies in its capacity to enhance negotiation outcomes across various sectors by emphasizing mutual benefit, cultural competence, and emotional intelligence. The proposed research will not only fill existing gaps in the literature but also provide actionable insights for practitioners, educators, and policymakers. The anticipated impact includes improved negotiation practices, stronger relationships, and innovative solutions to complex challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain

This research will analyze how the integration of these principles can enhance negotiation practices in Domain B.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it challenges the prevailing paradigms in Domain B by introducing collaborative negotiation strategies. It aims to redefine the negotiation landscape by leveraging insights from psychology, sociology, and cultural studies to create a more holistic approach to negotiation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can collaborative negotiation principles from Domain A be effectively integrated into Domain B?
2. What are the implications of this integration on negotiation outcomes?
3. How does cultural competence and emotional intelligence influence negotiation effectiveness?
