By reimagining negotiation as a collaborative process, this dissertation aims to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of negotiation strategies across diverse contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How does emotional intelligence influence negotiation outcomes?
2. In what ways can cultural adaptability enhance negotiation effectiveness?
3. What new pedagogical approaches can be developed to teach these integrated concepts in negotiation training?
