# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Guest Experience Principles into RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry with RSA cryptography, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances user engagement, personalization, and security in cryptographic systems. By examining the intersections between these two fields, the research seeks to develop new frameworks and methodologies that prioritize user experience in cryptographic practices, thereby revolutionizing how users interact with digital security systems. The potential impact of this research extends to various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, ultimately fostering a more secure and user-friendly digital environment.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experience through personalization, service quality, and technology integration. Conversely, RSA cryptography has traditionally emphasized security and technical robustness, often at the expense of user experience. This dissertation proposes a novel approach that applies principles from guest experience to RSA cryptography, thereby creating a more user-centric paradigm.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on cryptographic design. By prioritizing user experience, the study aims to address common vulnerabilities in RSA implementations and enhance user trust and satisfaction. The novelty lies in the application of hospitality principles—such as personalization and co-creation—within the cryptographic domain, creating a framework that redefines user interaction with security protocols.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be effectively integrated into RSA cryptography to enhance user satisfaction and security?
2. What are the critical "moments of truth" in cryptographic processes that can be optimized for better user experience?
3. How does user co-creation influence the design and effectiveness of cryptographic protocols?
