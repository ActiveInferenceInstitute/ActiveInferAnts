# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Concepts of Exercise into the Context of William Blake’s Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of exercise science and the literary and artistic contributions of William Blake. By transposing exercise principles onto Blake's work, the research aims to illuminate the holistic nature of creativity, well-being, and the interconnectedness of mind and body. This study not only contributes to the understanding of Blake's oeuvre but also proposes a novel framework—Creative Fitness—that integrates physical activity with artistic engagement to promote mental health and emotional resilience. The potential impact of this research extends to educational practices, therapeutic approaches, and community wellness initiatives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of exercise science and the literary and artistic realms exemplified by William Blake. Exercise, traditionally focused on physical health, is juxtaposed with Blake's exploration of imagination, spirituality, and the human condition. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to redefine both fields by recognizing the parallels between physical activity and artistic engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of both exercise and art. By framing creativity as a form of exercise, we can explore new methodologies for enhancing mental health and emotional resilience. This dissertation will contribute to the burgeoning field of Creative Wellness, highlighting the transformative power of integrating physical and artistic practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of exercise be transposed onto the interpretation of William Blake’s work?
2. What are the cognitive and emotional benefits of engaging with art and literature through a physical lens?
3. How can the framework of Creative Fitness be developed and applied in educational and therapeutic contexts?
