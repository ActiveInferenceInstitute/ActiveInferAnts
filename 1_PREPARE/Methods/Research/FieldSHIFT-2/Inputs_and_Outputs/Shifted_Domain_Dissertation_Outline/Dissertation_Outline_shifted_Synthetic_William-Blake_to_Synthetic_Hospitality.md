# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Fusion of William Blake's Life and Work with Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic and philosophical principles with contemporary guest experience strategies in the hospitality industry. By transposing Blake's concepts of personal vision, duality, and artistic fusion into hospitality practices, the research will uncover new methodologies for enhancing guest engagement and satisfaction. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize the hospitality sector by integrating artistic and narrative-driven experiences, thereby creating a more profound emotional connection between guests and their environments. Ultimately, this dissertation will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications, offering a roadmap for future research and industry innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of the creative world of William Blake and the practical realm of guest experience in hospitality. William Blake, a seminal figure of the Romantic Age, is celebrated for his visionary art and poetry, which emphasized the power of imagination and the exploration of human duality. Conversely, the guest experience in hospitality focuses on the holistic interaction between guests and service providers, emphasizing personalization, quality, and emotional resonance. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, leveraging Blake's insights to enhance contemporary hospitality practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a pioneering framework that integrates artistic principles into the hospitality sector, an area often dominated by efficiency and standardization. By highlighting the transformative potential of creativity and narrative engagement, the dissertation aims to challenge traditional notions of guest experience and propose innovative practices that foster deeper connections between guests and their environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of William Blake's life and work be transposed into the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the potential impacts of integrating artistic and narrative-driven experiences on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can hospitality organizations empower staff to enhance the guest experience through creativity and personal engagement?
4. What new theoretical constructs can emerge from this interdisciplinary fusion, and how can they inform future research and practice?
