# Transposing William Blake's Concepts into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection between the philosophical and artistic principles of William Blake and the contemporary practices of guest experience in the hospitality industry. By transposing Blake's concepts—such as duality, visionary experiences, and artistic integration—onto the guest experience framework, this research aims to develop a transformative model that enhances guest satisfaction, emotional engagement, and overall experience. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine hospitality practices through a multi-sensory, imaginative approach, ultimately contributing to both academic discourse and practical applications in the field.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of creating memorable and engaging guest experiences. Concurrently, the study of William Blake's life and work reveals profound insights into human experience, imagination, and the interplay of opposites. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, offering a novel perspective on how Blake's artistic and philosophical ideas can inform and enhance guest experiences in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it merges the realms of art and hospitality, proposing a new lens through which to view guest experiences. By applying Blake's principles, the study aims to address contemporary challenges in hospitality, such as personalization, emotional engagement, and the integration of technology and human interaction.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can William Blake's concepts of duality and visionary experiences be applied to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
- What new theoretical frameworks can be developed from this transposition, and how can they inform hospitality practices?
- What practical applications can emerge from integrating artistic expression into the guest experience?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
This section will provide a detailed exploration of William Blake's life, his artistic philosophy, and his contributions to literature and visual art. It will also examine the evolution of the hospitality industry, focusing on the shift towards guest-centered service models.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
An overview of contemporary research in both literary studies, particularly focusing on Blake, and hospitality management will be presented. This will include discussions on personalization, technology integration, and the importance of guest experience.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying gaps in current hospitality research, particularly the lack of interdisciplinary approaches, will highlight the need for innovative frameworks that incorporate artistic and philosophical insights into practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
This section will outline key theories from both Blake's work (such as the concept of contraries) and hospitality management (such as service quality and customer satisfaction).

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
New constructs will be developed, including the "Dual Experience Framework" and "Imaginative Engagement Theory," which will serve as the basis for the proposed model.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model will be presented, illustrating how Blake's principles can be systematically applied to enhance guest experiences.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the impact of Blake's concepts on guest experiences.

### Data Collection Methods
Data will be collected through surveys, interviews with hospitality professionals, and case studies of establishments that have successfully integrated artistic elements into their guest experience.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analysis will be used to evaluate survey data, while thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will include informed consent, confidentiality, and the respectful representation of participants' insights.
