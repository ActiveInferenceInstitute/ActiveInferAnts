# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Ideas

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake’s artistic and philosophical contributions with Buckminster Fuller’s design principles and systems thinking. By integrating Blake’s emphasis on imagination, duality, and interconnectedness with Fuller’s focus on sustainability and holistic design, this research aims to establish a new paradigm known as **“Visionary Design Science.”** This interdisciplinary approach not only seeks to address contemporary global challenges but also aims to inspire a cultural renaissance that values creativity alongside technical proficiency. The potential impact of this research extends to education, industry practices, and societal values, fostering a more sustainable and imaginative future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the visionary art and philosophy of William Blake with the innovative design and systems thinking of Buckminster Fuller. Blake's work emphasizes the importance of imagination and the dualities of human experience, while Fuller provides a framework for sustainable living and resource management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between the arts and sciences, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how creativity can inform sustainable design practices. The novelty lies in the synthesis of these two distinct fields, creating a new framework that encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and holistic approaches to problem-solving.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake’s concepts of imagination and duality inform Fuller’s sustainable design principles?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these two domains?
3. How can the proposed Visionary Design Science framework be applied in real-world contexts to address global challenges?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **William Blake**: Exploration of Blake's life, artistic methods, and philosophical themes, including his critique of rationalism and emphasis on spirituality.
- **Buckminster Fuller**: Examination of Fuller's contributions to design science, systems thinking, and sustainability, focusing on his innovative approaches to addressing societal challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
