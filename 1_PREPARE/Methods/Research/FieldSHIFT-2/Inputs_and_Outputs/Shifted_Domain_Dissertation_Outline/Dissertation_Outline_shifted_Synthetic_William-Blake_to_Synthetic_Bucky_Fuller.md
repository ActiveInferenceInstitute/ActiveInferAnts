# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Concepts into Buckminster Fuller’s Framework

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of William Blake's visionary concepts with Buckminster Fuller's holistic design principles. By examining the intersections of spirituality, creativity, and sustainable design, this research seeks to develop a new interdisciplinary framework that enhances our understanding of both artistic expression and environmental responsibility. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to inspire new approaches to design that are both ethically grounded and ecologically sustainable, fostering a more interconnected and harmonious world.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of two historically distinct fields: the artistic and spiritual philosophies of William Blake and the innovative, sustainability-focused design principles of Buckminster Fuller. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to elucidate how these two thinkers, despite their different contexts and mediums, converge on critical themes of interconnectedness, transformation, and the human experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between the arts and sciences, creating a new lexicon and framework for understanding the role of creativity in addressing global challenges. By situating Blake's spiritual insights within Fuller's design science, the dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of how imaginative and ethical considerations can inform sustainable practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Blake’s concepts of contraries and interconnectedness inform Fuller's design principles?
- In what ways can the integration of spirituality and creativity enhance sustainable design practices?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the synthesis of Blake's and Fuller’s ideas, and how can they be applied in contemporary contexts?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **William Blake**: Exploration of Blake’s poetry, art, and philosophical writings, focusing on his themes of dualities, spirituality, and societal critique.
- **Buckminster Fuller**: Examination of Fuller’s contributions to architecture, design science, and sustainability, emphasizing his holistic approach and innovative concepts.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of existing scholarship on Blake’s influence in modern art and spirituality.
- Analysis of Fuller’s legacy in sustainable design and environmental movements.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary research that combines artistic and design principles.
- Exploration of potential applications of Blake’s spiritual insights in contemporary design practices.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blake’s Dualities**: The coexistence of opposites as a framework for understanding creativity and conflict.
- **Fuller’s Synergetics**: The study of systems and emergent behavior in design.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Visionary Design**: A framework integrating creativity and ethical considerations in sustainable design.
- **Synergetic Art**: Artistic practices that embody principles of interconnectedness and systems thinking.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that synthesizes Blake’s and Fuller’s concepts, illustrating the interplay between spirituality, creativity, and sustainability.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative research design employing case studies, interviews, and participatory action research.

### Data Collection Methods
- Analysis of primary texts from Blake and Fuller.
- Interviews with contemporary artists and designers who embody these principles.
- Case studies of projects that successfully integrate art and sustainable design.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis to identify key themes and constructs.
- Comparative analysis to explore the intersections of Blake’s and Fuller’s ideas.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring respectful engagement with the spiritual and cultural dimensions of Blake’s work.
- Adhering to ethical guidelines in conducting interviews and participatory research.
