# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Entomology into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles from entomology with the philosophical framework of Buckminster Fuller. By identifying isomorphisms between insect behavior and Fuller's design principles, the research seeks to develop a new paradigm for sustainable architecture and urban planning. The proposed research will contribute to the fields of ecological design, biomimicry, and systems thinking, providing innovative insights into adaptive, multifunctional, and resilient structures. The expected impact includes enhanced sustainability practices in architecture, new interdisciplinary research avenues, and practical applications that address global environmental challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges entomology, the study of insects, with Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy of design and sustainability. This interdisciplinary fusion offers a unique perspective on how biological principles can inform architectural practices, emphasizing adaptability, efficiency, and interconnectedness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it presents a novel approach to sustainable design, leveraging insights from nature to address contemporary challenges in architecture and urban planning. By adopting an entomological lens, the study aims to create designs that are not only functional but also responsive to environmental changes, thereby promoting resilience and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of metamorphosis in insects inform adaptive design processes in architecture?
2. In what ways can the multifunctional roles of insects be translated into architectural design to enhance sustainability?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of entomology and Fuller's design philosophy?
