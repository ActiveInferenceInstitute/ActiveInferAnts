## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of entomology, the study of insects, and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy represents a novel approach to sustainability and resource efficiency. Insects, as the most diverse group of organisms on Earth, exhibit remarkable adaptability and interconnectedness within ecosystems. Fuller’s vision of a sustainable future emphasizes holistic thinking and innovative design solutions. This dissertation will explore how these two distinct fields can inform and enrich one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges gaps between biological sciences and design methodologies, promoting a deeper understanding of ecological systems and their applications in human design. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of entomological insights into design science, offering new paradigms for addressing contemporary challenges such as climate change, urbanization, and resource scarcity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles derived from entomology inform sustainable design practices?
2. What are the potential applications of insect-inspired designs in urban planning and architecture?
3. How can the integration of these fields contribute to a more resilient and adaptive society?
