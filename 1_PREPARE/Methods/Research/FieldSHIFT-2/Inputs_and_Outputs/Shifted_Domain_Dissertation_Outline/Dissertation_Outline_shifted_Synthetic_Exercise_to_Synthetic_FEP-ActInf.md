# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative integration of exercise science with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference, creating a novel Shifted Domain that offers unprecedented insights into human health and fitness. This interdisciplinary approach aims to redefine exercise not merely as a physical activity but as an active inference process that optimizes health outcomes through predictive coding. The research will uncover new methodologies, theoretical constructs, and practical applications that enhance our understanding of health, fitness, and well-being, thereby impacting both academic discourse and real-world practices.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion between exercise science, which traditionally focuses on physical health and fitness, and the theoretical frameworks of the Free Energy Principle and active inference, which describe how biological systems maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments through predictive processing. This integration allows for a deeper understanding of the physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying exercise and health.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on exercise, framing it as a complex, adaptive system influenced by predictive coding and variational free energy. The novelty lies in the application of FEP to exercise science, creating a new lexicon and theoretical framework that can guide future research and practical applications in health and fitness.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can exercise be conceptualized as an active inference process?
2. What are the implications of applying the Free Energy Principle to personalized exercise regimens?
3. How does regular exercise influence cognitive functions through predictive coding mechanisms?
4. What new methodologies and frameworks can emerge from this integration to optimize health outcomes?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of exercise science has transitioned from ancient practices to a sophisticated understanding of physical fitness, incorporating insights from physiology, psychology, and nutrition. Meanwhile, the Free Energy Principle has emerged from theoretical neuroscience and physics, emphasizing the adaptive nature of biological systems.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in exercise science highlights the importance of personalized training and the integration of technology in fitness regimens. Conversely, the FEP has primarily focused on cognitive and sensory processes in biological systems, with limited application to physical health.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, a significant gap exists in applying the FEP to exercise science. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that connects the adaptive processes of exercise with predictive coding principles.

# Theoretical Framework
