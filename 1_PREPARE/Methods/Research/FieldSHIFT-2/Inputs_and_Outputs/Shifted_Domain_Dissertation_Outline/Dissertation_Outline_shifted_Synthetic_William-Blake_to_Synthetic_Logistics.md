# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic philosophy and the field of logistics, aiming to develop a transformative framework that integrates imaginative thinking, ethical practices, and sustainability into logistics management. By examining the parallels between Blake's emphasis on creativity, spirituality, and social critique with the challenges faced in modern logistics, this research seeks to establish a new paradigm—termed the "Blakean Model of Logistics"—that prioritizes visionary approaches to supply chain management. The potential impact of this research extends beyond logistics, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and societal well-being.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's life and work with logistics represents a novel approach to understanding and addressing the complexities of modern supply chains. Blake's artistic vision and critique of materialism provide a rich conceptual framework for rethinking logistics as a creative and ethical discipline.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of logistics as merely operational, proposing a more holistic perspective that incorporates creativity, spirituality, and social responsibility. The novelty lies in the application of Blakean principles to logistics, creating a new lens through which to analyze and improve supply chain practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and contraries inform innovative practices in logistics?
2. In what ways can a spiritual approach to work enhance ethical considerations in supply chain management?
3. What frameworks can be developed to balance efficiency and sustainability in logistics?
