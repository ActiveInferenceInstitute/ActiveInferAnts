# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the life and work of William Blake, a visionary poet and artist, with the field of logistics. By integrating Blake's philosophical concepts of duality, imagination, and visionary thinking, this research aims to revolutionize logistics practices, fostering creativity and adaptability in supply chain management. The proposed framework not only addresses current challenges in logistics but also establishes a new paradigm that values artistic insight alongside data-driven methodologies. The potential impact of this research extends beyond logistics, inspiring interdisciplinary collaborations and innovative educational approaches.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
