# PhD Dissertation Plan: Bridging Cognitive Security and the Free Energy Principle through Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Cognitive Security with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. By identifying isomorphisms between these two domains, the research will propose a novel framework that reinterprets cognitive processes in the context of information integrity and decision-making. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive resilience against misinformation, enhance technological solutions for misinformation detection, and inform educational approaches. This dissertation will not only contribute to theoretical advancements but also propose practical applications in industry and policy.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of Cognitive Security, which focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy. This intersection offers a unique perspective on how cognitive biases, misinformation, and decision-making can be understood through predictive models.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of these domains allows for a comprehensive understanding of cognitive processes in the digital age. By framing cognitive security measures as active inference processes, this research will provide a fresh lens through which to view cognitive resilience and misinformation. The novelty lies in the application of predictive coding principles to cognitive security, offering new hypotheses and methodologies for research.
