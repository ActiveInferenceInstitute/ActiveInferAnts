# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Context of the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Cognitive Security and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), presenting a comprehensive framework for understanding how cognitive processes can be safeguarded against misinformation through the lens of predictive coding and active inference. By integrating these two domains, the research seeks to elucidate novel strategies for enhancing information integrity, fostering community resilience, and developing adaptive systems that minimize cognitive dissonance. The anticipated impact of this work includes advancing theoretical constructs in both fields, informing educational practices, and guiding technological innovations that address contemporary challenges in information processing.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Cognitive Security emphasizes the protection of cognitive processes from manipulation, while the Free Energy Principle provides a theoretical foundation for understanding adaptive behavior in living systems. This dissertation investigates the synergies between these domains, positing that cognitive security measures can be interpreted as active inference processes that enhance resilience against cognitive threats.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of Cognitive Security with the Free Energy Principle offers a groundbreaking perspective on how individuals and communities can navigate the complexities of information in an increasingly digital landscape. This novel approach not only broadens the scope of both fields but also presents unique opportunities for empirical research and practical applications.
