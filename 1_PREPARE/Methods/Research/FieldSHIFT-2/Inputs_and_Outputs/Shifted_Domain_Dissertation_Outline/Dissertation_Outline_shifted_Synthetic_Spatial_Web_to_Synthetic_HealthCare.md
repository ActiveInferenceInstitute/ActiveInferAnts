# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Health Care Through the Lens of the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of the Spatial Web in revolutionizing health care delivery. By integrating advanced technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing, this research will investigate how these innovations can enhance patient experiences, improve health outcomes, and streamline service delivery. The significance of this research lies in its ability to bridge two distinct domains, creating a novel interdisciplinary field that combines spatial technologies with health care practices. The anticipated impact includes improved patient engagement, reduced hospital readmissions, and the establishment of a new lexicon and framework for future health care practices.
