# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Exercise into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of exercise science and non-science ways of knowing, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes holistic health and well-being. By integrating intuitive movement practices, storytelling, and cultural rituals into fitness regimens, this research aims to redefine exercise not merely as a physical endeavor but as a multifaceted approach to health that honors diverse cultural perspectives. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic discourse, influencing educational frameworks, community health programs, and individual wellness practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of exercise science and non-science ways of knowing presents an opportunity to bridge the gap between empirical research and cultural wisdom. Exercise has traditionally been viewed through a scientific lens, focusing on physical metrics. In contrast, non-science ways of knowing emphasize experiential, intuitive, and cultural understandings of health.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing paradigms in exercise science by incorporating non-scientific perspectives. It aims to create a comprehensive framework that acknowledges the value of personal experience, cultural practices, and emotional intelligence in promoting health and fitness.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can intuitive movement practices enhance adherence to exercise regimens?
2. In what ways can storytelling about fitness journeys foster community engagement and motivation?
3. What are the implications of integrating cultural rituals into exercise for holistic health?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
1. The evolution of exercise practices from ancient civilizations to modern fitness trends.
2. The development of non-science ways of knowing, including indigenous knowledge systems and philosophical approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
1. Key findings in exercise science regarding health benefits and physiological mechanisms.
2. The role of non-scientific knowledge in shaping cultural perceptions of health and wellness.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
1. Lack of integration between scientific and non-scientific approaches in health research.
2. Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration to enrich understanding of holistic health.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
1. Theories of exercise physiology and health behavior.
2. Theories of cultural anthropology and experiential learning.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
1. A model of holistic health that incorporates physical, emotional, and cultural dimensions.
2. A framework for understanding the interplay between intuitive practices and structured exercise.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- **Holistic Health Model:** A synthesis of exercise science and non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing the interconnectedness of body, mind, and culture.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research.

### Data Collection Methods
1. Surveys and questionnaires to assess attitudes toward exercise and non-scientific practices.
2. Interviews and focus groups to gather personal narratives and cultural insights.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative data.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring cultural sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives in research practices.
