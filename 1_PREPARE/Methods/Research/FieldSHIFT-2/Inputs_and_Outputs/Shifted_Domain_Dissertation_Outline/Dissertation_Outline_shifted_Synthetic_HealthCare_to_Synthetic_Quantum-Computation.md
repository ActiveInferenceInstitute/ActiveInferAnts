# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles and methodologies from health care into the realm of quantum computation. By examining the intersections between these two distinct fields, we seek to develop a user-centered approach to quantum algorithms that enhances their applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize quantum computing practices, making them more relevant to user needs while simultaneously improving patient outcomes in health care. This interdisciplinary fusion promises to create new standards for quality assurance in quantum computation, ultimately leading to advancements in both fields.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between health care and quantum computation. Health care has long prioritized patient-centered approaches, emphasizing the importance of the user experience, service quality, and technology integration. Quantum computation, on the other hand, operates on the principles of quantum mechanics, focusing on computational efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. By merging these domains, we can establish a framework that values user experience in quantum computing, akin to patient experience in health care.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses critical gaps in both fields. In health care, the integration of technology has not fully leveraged the potential of quantum computing for personalized medicine and data analysis. Conversely, quantum computation has yet to adopt a user-centered approach that considers the end-user experience. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary methodology, which combines user-centric design principles from health care with advanced computational techniques in quantum systems.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can health care principles be applied to enhance user experience in quantum computing?
2. What are the implications of user-centered quantum algorithms for solving complex optimization problems?
3. How can the integration of user feedback improve the adaptability and relevance of quantum algorithms?
