# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Biology through the Lens of Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of health care and biology, proposing a novel framework termed "Ecosystem-Centered Care." By integrating principles from health care into biological conservation and ecosystem management, the research seeks to enhance biodiversity, community engagement, and resilience of ecosystems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine conservation strategies, promote public health, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The dissertation will contribute to both fields by generating new hypotheses, developing practical applications, and proposing a long-term research agenda that emphasizes the interconnectedness of human health and ecosystem health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a transformative fusion of health care and biology, recognizing the parallels between patient care and ecosystem management. This innovative perspective emphasizes the importance of community involvement and continuous monitoring in both domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between health care and biology, proposing an integrated approach that can lead to enhanced outcomes in both fields. The novelty lies in applying patient-centered care principles to ecosystem management, thereby creating a framework that values biodiversity and community engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of patient-centered care be effectively transposed onto ecosystem management?
2. What are the potential impacts of implementing continuity of care models in ecological contexts?
3. How can community involvement enhance biodiversity and ecosystem resilience?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Health Care**: Transition from paternalistic models to patient-centered care, with a focus on technology integration and personalized medicine.
- **Biology**: Evolution from descriptive studies to integrative approaches, emphasizing genetics, ecology, and conservation.
