# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Concepts to Biology (Ecosystem Context)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative transposition of health care principles into ecosystem management, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that emphasizes patient-centered care and service quality in ecological contexts. By integrating concepts from health care with biological ecosystems, this research seeks to enhance biodiversity, improve ecosystem resilience, and foster sustainable practices that benefit both human and environmental health. The potential impact of this work extends to policy development, community engagement, and the creation of new sub-disciplines, positioning this dissertation at the forefront of environmental and health sciences.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between health care and ecology, where principles traditionally applied to patient care are reimagined to address the complexities of ecosystem management. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of human health and environmental vitality, proposing that ecosystems can benefit from personalized and quality-driven management strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms in both health care and ecology by advocating for a holistic view of systems. The novelty lies in the systematic application of health care concepts—such as patient-centeredness, service quality, and technology integration—within ecological frameworks, offering fresh insights into biodiversity preservation and ecosystem health.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to ecosystem management to enhance biodiversity and resilience?
2. What metrics can be developed to assess the quality of ecosystem services analogous to health care service quality?
3. In what ways can technology improve communication and monitoring in ecosystems, similar to its role in health care?
