# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts to ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary arts and banking technology, specifically through the lens of ATM transactions. By transposing culinary principles such as preparation techniques, flavor profiles, and user experience into the domain of ATM design, this research proposes to enhance user satisfaction and efficiency in banking interactions. The significance of this research lies in its potential to not only improve the functionality and appeal of ATMs but also to create a new paradigm in user experience design across various sectors. The findings are expected to contribute to both the culinary and banking fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and leading to the emergence of new sub-disciplines.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of culinary arts and banking technology, specifically focusing on ATM transactions. Culinary arts emphasize sensory engagement, organization, and user experience, while banking technology prioritizes efficiency, security, and user interaction. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these two fields, applying culinary principles to enhance the ATM experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of banking technology by applying creative and sensory-driven principles from culinary arts. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of culinary concepts to enhance user experience in banking, creating a framework that can be adapted across various technological interfaces.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary principles enhance the user experience of ATM transactions?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating culinary concepts into banking technology?
3. How can the idea of "transaction mise en place" improve efficiency and user satisfaction?
