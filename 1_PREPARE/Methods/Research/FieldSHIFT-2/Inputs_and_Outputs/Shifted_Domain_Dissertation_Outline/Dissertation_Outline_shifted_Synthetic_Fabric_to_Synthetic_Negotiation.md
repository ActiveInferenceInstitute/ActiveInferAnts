# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fabric industry and arts encompass a diverse range of practices, from artisanal craftsmanship to industrial production, emphasizing creativity, sustainability, and cultural significance. Negotiation, on the other hand, is a multifaceted dialogue aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements, characterized by effective communication, strategic thinking, and cultural awareness. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, exploring how principles from the fabric industry can enhance negotiation practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of textile arts into negotiation practices represents a novel approach that emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and cultural context. This research addresses a critical gap in existing literature, exploring how artistic principles can inform and transform negotiation strategies, ultimately leading to more sustainable and meaningful agreements.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles from the fabric industry enhance negotiation strategies across various contexts?
2. What role do cultural narratives play in shaping negotiation practices and outcomes?
3. How can sustainable practices from the fabric industry be applied to negotiation processes?
