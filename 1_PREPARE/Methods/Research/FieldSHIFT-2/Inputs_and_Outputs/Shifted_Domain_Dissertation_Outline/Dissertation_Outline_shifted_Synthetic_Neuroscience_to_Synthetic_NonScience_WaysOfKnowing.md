# Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing neuroscience into non-science ways of knowing, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges scientific inquiry with cultural understanding. By examining the intersections between neural processes and cultural practices, this research will uncover new insights into how knowledge is constructed, transmitted, and adapted within communities. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine educational approaches, foster community resilience, and enhance emotional well-being through a deeper understanding of cultural dynamics. The outcomes of this research will not only advance theoretical knowledge but also offer practical applications for various sectors, including education, policy-making, and community development.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of neuroscience, a rigorous scientific discipline, with non-science ways of knowing, which encompass holistic, experiential, and culturally rooted methods of understanding. This convergence allows for a rich exploration of how cognitive processes and cultural practices inform and shape human experience.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its innovative approach to knowledge integration, challenging traditional boundaries between science and non-science. By leveraging insights from neuroscience, this dissertation will provide a new lens through which to examine cultural practices, offering a fresh perspective on adaptability, resilience, and community support systems.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience be applied to understand and enhance cultural practices?
2. What are the implications of cultural neuroplasticity for community resilience and adaptation?
3. How do cultural narratives function as symbolic messengers that influence emotional states and behaviors?
4. What interdisciplinary methodologies can be developed to facilitate this integration of knowledge?
