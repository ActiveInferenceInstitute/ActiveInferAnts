# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of neuroscience and non-science ways of knowing, providing a comprehensive framework that bridges empirical scientific understanding with holistic, experiential, and cultural perspectives. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research seeks to develop new theoretical constructs, methodologies, and applications that enhance personal growth, community resilience, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The potential impact of this work extends to education, policy-making, and societal well-being, fostering a deeper appreciation of diverse knowledge systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a transformative intersection between neuroscience, a field grounded in empirical research on the nervous system, and non-science ways of knowing, which encompass holistic, narrative, and cultural understandings. This integration offers a novel perspective on how knowledge is constructed, shared, and applied across various contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional dichotomies between science and non-science, proposing a more inclusive approach to knowledge that recognizes the value of diverse epistemologies. The novelty lies in the application of neuroscience principles to enhance non-scientific knowledge systems, potentially revolutionizing educational practices, community engagement, and emotional intelligence training.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of neuroscience be transposed into non-science ways of knowing?
2. What new theoretical frameworks emerge from this integration?
3. How can these frameworks inform practical applications in education, community development, and emotional intelligence?
