# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of negotiation principles into the field of physical security, creating a transformative framework that enhances security measures through collaborative engagement, conflict resolution, and strategic communication. The research aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of how negotiation methodologies can address the limitations of traditional physical security approaches, fostering a culture of collaboration and stakeholder involvement. The anticipated impact includes improved security outcomes, enhanced community relations, and the establishment of new interdisciplinary connections between negotiation and security studies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between negotiation and physical security, two fields that have historically operated independently. Negotiation focuses on dialogue and relationship-building, while physical security emphasizes protective measures and technology. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these domains, proposing that negotiation principles can significantly enhance the effectiveness of physical security practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of physical security, which often rely on unilateral measures and technology. By introducing negotiation as a core component, the study offers a fresh perspective that prioritizes communication, collaboration, and stakeholder engagement. This novel approach has the potential to transform security practices, making them more adaptive to the complexities of human behavior and community dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into physical security practices?
- What are the impacts of collaborative security planning on compliance and stakeholder engagement?
- How does negotiation training influence conflict resolution outcomes in security contexts?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation:** Examination of the evolution of negotiation practices from simple bargaining to complex frameworks incorporating psychological and cultural dimensions.
- **Physical Security:** Overview of the development of physical security measures, focusing on technological advancements and the challenges posed by human factors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Negotiation:** Current trends emphasize collaborative negotiation and the role of technology in communication.
- **Physical Security:** A review of contemporary challenges, including the integration of technology, human behavior, and cultural contexts.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary research that combines negotiation strategies with physical security measures. Highlighting the potential for collaborative approaches to address current limitations in security practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Negotiation Theories:** Integrative and distributive negotiation, BATNA, and principled negotiation.
- **Security Theories:** Risk management and situational crime prevention theories.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
Introducing concepts such as Collaborative Security Negotiation (CSN) and Stakeholder Security Engagement (SSE) that reflect the integration of negotiation principles into physical security.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A comprehensive model that illustrates the interactions between negotiation strategies and physical security practices, emphasizing the role of stakeholder engagement and communication.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research to assess the effectiveness of negotiation integration in physical security.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with security professionals and stakeholders.
- Case studies of organizations implementing negotiation training and collaborative security planning.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify trends and correlations.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring confidentiality and informed consent from participants, particularly in sensitive security contexts.
