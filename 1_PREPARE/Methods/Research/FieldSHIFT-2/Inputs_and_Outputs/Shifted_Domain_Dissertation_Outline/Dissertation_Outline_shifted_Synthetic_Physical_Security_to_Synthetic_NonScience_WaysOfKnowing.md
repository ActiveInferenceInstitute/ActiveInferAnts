# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of physical security principles with non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework termed "holistic security." By examining the intersections between these two distinct fields, the research seeks to uncover new methodologies for community safety that prioritize cultural knowledge, emotional well-being, and social cohesion. The potential impact of this research spans various domains, including community resilience, conflict resolution, and policy development, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive understanding of security in contemporary society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of physical security—a field traditionally focused on protecting physical assets from threats—and non-science ways of knowing, which prioritize subjective, cultural, and experiential understanding. This intersection creates a novel landscape for addressing contemporary security challenges through holistic approaches.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional security paradigms, advocating for the inclusion of non-scientific perspectives in security practices. The novelty lies in developing an integrated framework that leverages traditional knowledge systems and modern security methodologies to foster community resilience and safety.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of physical security be effectively integrated with non-scientific ways of knowing to enhance community safety?
- What are the implications of this integration for social cohesion and conflict resolution?
- To develop a theoretical model that illustrates the interplay between these domains and proposes practical applications for communities.

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the evolution of physical security from basic protective measures to complex systems.
- Examination of non-science ways of knowing, focusing on their historical significance in cultural practices and decision-making.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of contemporary trends in physical security, including technology integration and community-based approaches.
- Review of literature on non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing holistic perspectives and their applications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of gaps in current security practices that overlook cultural and subjective dimensions.
- Opportunities for interdisciplinary research that bridges physical security and non-scientific knowledge systems.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Risk assessment theories in physical security.
- Cultural epistemologies from non-science ways of knowing.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Concept of "holistic security" that integrates both domains.
- Framework for intuitive risk assessment based on cultural knowledge.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that illustrates the relationships between physical security principles and non-scientific ways of knowing, focusing on their application in community settings.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of physical security and non-science ways of knowing.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with community members and security professionals.
- Case studies of communities that have implemented holistic security practices.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis of survey results to measure community perceptions of safety.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent and confidentiality for participants.
- Addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis.
