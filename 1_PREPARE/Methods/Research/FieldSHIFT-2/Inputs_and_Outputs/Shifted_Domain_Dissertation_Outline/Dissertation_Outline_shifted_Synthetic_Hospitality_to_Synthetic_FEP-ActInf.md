# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Guest Experience in Hospitality through the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience in the hospitality industry and the theoretical frameworks provided by the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By transposing concepts from cognitive science and predictive modeling into hospitality, this research will identify novel methodologies to enhance guest satisfaction and service delivery. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize how hospitality businesses understand and engage with guests, leading to improved outcomes for both guests and service providers. This dissertation will create a roadmap for integrating these two domains, offering insights that can transform industry practices and academic perspectives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and guest satisfaction, often relying on subjective measures of experience. In contrast, the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a robust framework for understanding how organisms, including humans, interact with their environments through predictive modeling and feedback mechanisms. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging established hospitality practices with advanced cognitive theories. By applying the principles of predictive coding and active inference to guest experiences, this study aims to create a new paradigm that enhances personalization and service quality.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
- What predictive models can be developed to better understand guest preferences and behaviors?
- How can real-time feedback mechanisms improve service delivery and guest satisfaction?
