# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience in Hospitality to the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes an innovative exploration of the intersection between guest experience in hospitality and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), aiming to create a new framework for understanding and enhancing interactions within the hospitality sector. By analyzing the principles of guest experience through the lens of FEP, this research seeks to develop novel hypotheses and theoretical constructs that can revolutionize both fields. The study's outcomes have the potential to significantly impact hospitality management practices, inform educational curricula, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately leading to improved guest satisfaction and sustainable operational practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalized services, quality interactions, and technological integration. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle offers a robust theoretical framework for understanding adaptive systems. This dissertation aims to merge these domains, creating a comprehensive understanding of how principles from cognitive science can inform hospitality practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between hospitality management and cognitive science, presenting a novel perspective on guest interactions as adaptive processes. By leveraging the FEP, the study proposes a transformative approach to guest experience that aligns with contemporary trends in technology and sustainability.
