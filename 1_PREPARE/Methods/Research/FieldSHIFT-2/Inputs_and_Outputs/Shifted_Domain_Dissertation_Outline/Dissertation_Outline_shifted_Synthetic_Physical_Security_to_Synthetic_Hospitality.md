# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Physical Security in Guest Experience Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of physical security principles into guest experience management within the hospitality industry. By examining the interplay between safety and service, the research aims to redefine guest experiences, enhance satisfaction, and foster loyalty. The significance of this work lies in its potential to create a new paradigm that prioritizes both security and guest engagement, ultimately transforming industry practices and contributing to broader societal well-being.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has historically focused on enhancing guest experiences through service quality and personalization. However, with rising concerns regarding safety and security, there is a pressing need to incorporate physical security measures into the guest experience narrative. This dissertation investigates how these two domains can converge to create a holistic approach to hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in hospitality management literature by integrating physical security concepts into guest experience frameworks. The novelty lies in the development of new models and practices that emphasize the importance of safety as a core component of guest satisfaction, thereby reshaping the hospitality landscape.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can physical security measures enhance the overall guest experience in hospitality settings?
- What are the perceptions of guests regarding the integration of security measures into their experience?
- How can hospitality establishments effectively communicate their security protocols to enhance guest confidence?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Physical Security:** Overview of the evolution of physical security measures from basic to advanced systems, highlighting the integration of technology and human factors.
- **Guest Experience:** Examination of the transition from transactional service to emotional engagement in hospitality, focusing on personalization and service quality.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of existing literature on physical security strategies and guest experience management, identifying key theories and practices in both domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of gaps in the literature regarding the integration of physical security into guest experience management and the potential for interdisciplinary research.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Risk Management Theories:** Application of risk assessment and management theories from physical security.
- **Service Quality Models:** Utilization of service quality frameworks to analyze guest experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Development of an integrated model that combines physical security and guest experience principles, termed "Secure Experience Model."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Visual representation and detailed explanation of the Secure Experience Model, illustrating the interconnections between safety, service quality, and guest satisfaction.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of physical security into guest experience management.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys, interviews, and case studies conducted in various hospitality settings to gather data on guest perceptions and experiences.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative interviews to identify trends and insights.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring participant confidentiality, informed consent, and adherence to ethical guidelines in conducting research.
