# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of guest experience from the hospitality industry and traditional knowledge systems. By systematically transposing principles from hospitality into the domain of traditional knowledge, the research aims to create a framework that enhances cultural engagement, promotes sustainability, and fosters community well-being. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize how traditional practices are shared and appreciated, ultimately contributing to ecological and cultural resilience. This work will provide a comprehensive foundation for future research, educational curricula, and practical applications that honor and elevate indigenous knowledge systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long been focused on optimizing guest experiences through personalization, service quality, and cultural engagement. Conversely, traditional knowledge represents the wisdom and practices of indigenous communities, emphasizing sustainability, cultural identity, and ecological stewardship. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, creating a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of each.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The fusion of guest experience principles with traditional knowledge offers a novel approach to cultural engagement. By recognizing the parallels between personalized guest experiences and community-specific practices, this research will contribute to the preservation and appreciation of traditional knowledge in a contemporary context.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience enhance the sharing and appreciation of traditional knowledge?
2. What are the implications of integrating technology in the transmission of traditional practices?
3. In what ways can sustainable practices within traditional knowledge inform modern hospitality approaches?
