# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into the realm of traditional knowledge. By examining the intersections between these two domains, the research seeks to develop an innovative framework that enhances the transmission and application of traditional practices while fostering engagement, sustainability, and cultural appreciation. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both academic discourse and practical applications, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and the revitalization of indigenous knowledge systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalization, service quality, and technology integration to create memorable interactions. Conversely, traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainable practices and environmental stewardship. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that merges these domains, recognizing the participant in traditional knowledge as a "guest."

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need to preserve traditional knowledge in the face of globalization and modernization while leveraging contemporary hospitality principles. The novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, offering fresh perspectives on community engagement, education, and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience enhance the transmission of traditional knowledge?
2. What role does technology play in bridging the gap between traditional knowledge and contemporary practices?
3. How can personalized learning experiences improve engagement and retention of traditional knowledge among participants?
