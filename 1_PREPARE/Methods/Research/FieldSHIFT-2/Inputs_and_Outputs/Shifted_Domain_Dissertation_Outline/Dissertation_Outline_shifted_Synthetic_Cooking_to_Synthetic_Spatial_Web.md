## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of cuisine and the Spatial Web, two previously distinct fields. Cuisine is a rich tapestry of culture, tradition, and creativity, while the Spatial Web merges physical and digital environments to enhance user interactions. This dissertation will investigate how culinary principles can inform and transform the design of user experiences in the Spatial Web.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on user experience design by applying culinary methodologies to digital interactions. It presents an opportunity to redefine how we approach data management and user engagement, creating a framework that can lead to innovative applications in technology and education.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How does the integration of diverse data sources enhance user experience in the Spatial Web?
- What are the user engagement outcomes of applying culinary principles to digital interaction design?
- How can the concept of flavor profiles inform user experience design methodologies?
- What are the implications of "data fusion" for real-time decision-making in smart environments?
