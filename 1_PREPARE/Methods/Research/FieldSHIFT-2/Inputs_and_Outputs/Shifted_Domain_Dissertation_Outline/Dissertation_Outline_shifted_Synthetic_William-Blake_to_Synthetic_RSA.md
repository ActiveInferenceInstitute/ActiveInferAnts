# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from William Blake's Life and Work to RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic philosophy and RSA cryptography. It aims to establish a novel framework—termed "Imaginative Cryptography"—that integrates the principles of creativity and duality found in Blake's work with the technical rigor of cryptographic practices. Through this interdisciplinary approach, the research seeks to enhance user engagement, promote ethical considerations, and inspire new methodologies in secure communications. The potential impact of this study extends beyond academia, influencing industry applications, educational paradigms, and societal perceptions of privacy and security.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake’s visionary principles with RSA cryptography represents a groundbreaking shift in how we conceptualize security and creativity. Blake's emphasis on imagination and the reconciliation of opposites offers a rich philosophical foundation for rethinking cryptographic practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional view of cryptography as a purely technical field. By integrating artistic principles, the dissertation proposes a new paradigm that prioritizes user experience and ethical considerations, thereby addressing contemporary challenges in digital security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake’s artistic principles inform the design and implementation of cryptographic systems?
2. In what ways can the integration of creativity enhance user engagement and understanding of cryptographic practices?
3. What are the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for education and industry in the field of cryptography?
