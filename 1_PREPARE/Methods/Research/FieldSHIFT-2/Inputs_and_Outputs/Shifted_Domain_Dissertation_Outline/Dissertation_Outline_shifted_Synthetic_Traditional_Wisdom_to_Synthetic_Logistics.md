## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of traditional knowledge and logistics, two fields that have historically operated in silos. Traditional knowledge encompasses sustainable practices developed over generations, rooted in ecological stewardship and community engagement. In contrast, logistics focuses on the efficient movement of goods, often prioritizing cost-effectiveness and technology. This dissertation investigates how the principles of traditional knowledge can inform and enhance modern logistics practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of traditional knowledge into logistics is significant for several reasons. It offers a fresh perspective on sustainability, challenges existing paradigms of efficiency, and promotes community involvement. This research is novel in its approach, as it seeks to create a theoretical framework that bridges these two domains, ultimately leading to innovative logistics strategies that are both efficient and socially responsible.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can traditional ecological practices enhance the sustainability of modern logistics?
- In what ways can community engagement reshape supply chain dynamics?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of traditional knowledge into logistics?
