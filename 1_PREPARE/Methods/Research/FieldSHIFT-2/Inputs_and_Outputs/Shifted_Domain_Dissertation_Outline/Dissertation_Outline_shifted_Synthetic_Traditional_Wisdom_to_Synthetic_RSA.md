# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge to RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and RSA Cryptography, highlighting the transformative potential of integrating community-based, sustainable practices into modern cryptographic systems. By bridging these two distinct domains, the research seeks to develop novel frameworks for key management, enhance security protocols, and promote community engagement in cryptographic practices. The anticipated impact extends beyond cryptography, influencing ecological resilience, cultural identity, and community trust in digital systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of Traditional Knowledge, which embodies community-centric, sustainable practices, and RSA Cryptography, a foundational technology for secure data transmission. This integration acknowledges the need for adaptive security measures that reflect the complexities of modern societal challenges.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of cryptography by incorporating holistic, community-based approaches. The novelty lies in the application of TK principles to enhance the resilience and adaptability of cryptographic systems, which is critical in the face of emerging threats such as quantum computing.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of Traditional Knowledge inform the development of more resilient RSA cryptographic systems?
2. In what ways can community engagement enhance the security and trustworthiness of cryptographic practices?
