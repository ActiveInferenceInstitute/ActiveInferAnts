# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic and literary insights with contemporary neuroscience, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines our understanding of creativity, imagination, and the neural underpinnings of human experience. By examining Blake's concepts of contraries, visionary experiences, and the integration of art and poetry, this research will provide a novel theoretical framework that enriches neuroscience. The potential impact of this work extends to therapeutic practices, educational methodologies, and interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the human mind.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's artistic vision and the empirical rigor of neuroscience creates a unique opportunity to explore the qualitative dimensions of human experience that traditional neuroscience often overlooks. This Shifted Domain invites an examination of how imagination and creativity can be understood through a neuroscientific lens, while also enriching our appreciation of Blake's contributions to art and literature.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing materialistic paradigms of neuroscience by incorporating subjective experiences and artistic insights. The novelty lies in the development of an integrated theoretical model that bridges the gap between qualitative and quantitative research, opening new avenues for understanding consciousness, creativity, and emotional regulation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and contraries inform our understanding of neural processes?
2. What are the neural correlates of visionary experiences as described by Blake?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach contribute to new therapeutic practices in mental health?
