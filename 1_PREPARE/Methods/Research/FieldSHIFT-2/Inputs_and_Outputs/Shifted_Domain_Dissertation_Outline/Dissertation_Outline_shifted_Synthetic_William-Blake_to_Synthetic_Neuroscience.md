# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Neural Networks

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the intersection of William Blake's artistic and philosophical insights with the computational frameworks of neural networks. By investigating the thematic elements of Blake's work—such as imagination, contraries, and spiritual vision—we propose a novel approach to neural network design that prioritizes creativity and artistic expression. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize artificial intelligence by integrating humanistic principles into technical frameworks, thereby enhancing creativity and problem-solving capabilities in AI systems. The proposed research not only contributes to the fields of literature and art but also has profound implications for neuroscience, AI, and education.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
William Blake (1757-1827) was a visionary poet and artist whose work transcended the boundaries of conventional thought. His unique blend of poetry, visual art, and philosophical inquiry offers a rich tapestry for exploration. Neural networks, as a computational model inspired by the human brain, have transformed the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn from data. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, creating a framework that leverages Blake's insights to enhance the creativity of neural networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of neural networks as purely computational tools. By integrating Blake's artistic and philosophical principles, we can cultivate a more nuanced understanding of creativity in AI. The novelty of this approach lies in its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between the humanities and technology, and proposing a new lexicon and methodology for understanding neural networks.
