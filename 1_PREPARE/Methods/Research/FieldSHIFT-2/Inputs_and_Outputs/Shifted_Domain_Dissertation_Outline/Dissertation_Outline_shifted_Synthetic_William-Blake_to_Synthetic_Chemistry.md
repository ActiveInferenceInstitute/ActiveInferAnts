# Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between William Blake's life and work and the field of chemistry, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes the transformative potential of integrating artistic imagination with scientific inquiry. The research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that not only honors Blake's philosophical insights but also addresses contemporary challenges in chemistry. By transposing Blake's concepts of creativity, contraries, and artistic representation into chemistry, this dissertation seeks to generate novel hypotheses, innovative methodologies, and interdisciplinary collaborations that will significantly impact both fields. The potential outcomes include enhanced chemical education, innovative research practices, and a broader societal appreciation for the creative dimensions of science.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain bridges the visionary world of William Blake—a poet, artist, and philosopher—with the empirical realm of chemistry. Blake's work, characterized by a profound engagement with imagination and the reconciliation of opposites, provides a rich philosophical backdrop for re-examining the creative processes inherent in scientific research. This dissertation will explore how Blake's principles can inform and enhance the methodologies and conceptual frameworks within chemistry.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The proposed research is significant for several reasons: it challenges the traditional boundaries between the arts and sciences, promotes a holistic understanding of creativity in scientific inquiry, and offers innovative approaches to chemical education and research. By integrating Blake's insights into chemistry, this dissertation aims to foster a new paradigm that values imagination alongside empirical rigor, potentially leading to breakthroughs in both fields.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the philosophical and artistic principles articulated by William Blake be transposed into the field of chemistry?
2. What novel hypotheses and theories can emerge from this transposition, and how can they be empirically tested?
3. In what ways can integrating artistic methodologies enhance chemical education and public engagement with science?
