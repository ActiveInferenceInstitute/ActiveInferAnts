# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of two established fields: ATM transaction systems, characterized by user-centric design and robust security protocols, and physical security, which traditionally relies on layered approaches and risk assessments. This fusion aims to address the evolving needs of security in a digital age where user experience and data-driven decision-making are paramount.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its ability to transpose successful elements from ATM transactions—such as seamless user interfaces, real-time monitoring, and fraud detection—into physical security systems. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of security measures but also redefines user interaction with security technologies, making them more accessible and intuitive.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can user-centric design principles from ATM transactions be effectively integrated into physical security systems?
2. What role does real-time data analytics play in enhancing the security and user experience of physical security measures?
3. What are the measurable impacts of these integrations on security compliance, incident reduction, and user satisfaction?
