# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Game Design into Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of game design principles with blockchain technology, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances user engagement, interaction, and governance in decentralized applications. By leveraging the core elements of game design—such as player engagement, mechanics, and narrative integration—this research aims to develop novel frameworks that address current limitations in blockchain usability and community participation. The outcome of this research has the potential to reshape the landscape of both game design and blockchain technology, leading to new interdisciplinary collaborations, practical applications, and societal impacts.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of game design and blockchain technology presents a unique opportunity to leverage the strengths of both fields. Game design focuses on creating engaging user experiences, while blockchain offers decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. This dissertation will investigate how principles from game design can enhance blockchain applications, making them more intuitive and rewarding for users.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform user interaction within blockchain ecosystems. By applying game design principles, we can create more engaging and accessible applications that encourage broader participation. This novel approach not only addresses existing challenges in user engagement but also opens avenues for innovative economic models and governance structures.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into blockchain applications to enhance user engagement?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration, and how do they inform the development of decentralized applications?
3. What are the implications of gamifying blockchain systems for community governance and participation?
