# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of Digital Fabrication and Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of merging the fabric industry and arts with digital fabrication and design. By analyzing the core principles, methodologies, and historical contexts of both domains, this research will identify isomorphisms and propose innovative applications that leverage traditional craftsmanship within digital contexts. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine textile production, enhance sustainable practices, and foster cultural expression through technology. The outcomes will have broad implications for the fabric industry, digital design, and interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and culturally rich future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of the fabric industry and arts with digital fabrication represents a paradigm shift in how textiles are conceptualized, designed, and produced. This shift is characterized by the integration of traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology, allowing for new forms of expression and innovation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to bridge the gap between artisanal textile practices and digital design methodologies. By focusing on sustainability, cultural heritage, and technological innovation, the dissertation will contribute to both fields and propose a new framework for understanding textiles in the digital age.
