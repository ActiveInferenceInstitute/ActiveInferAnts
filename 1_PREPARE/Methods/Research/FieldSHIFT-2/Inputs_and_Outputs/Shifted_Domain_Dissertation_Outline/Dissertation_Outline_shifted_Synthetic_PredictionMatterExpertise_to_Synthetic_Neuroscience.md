# PhD Dissertation Plan: Bridging Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) with Neuroscience, proposing a novel interdisciplinary framework that enhances our understanding of cognitive processes through predictive modeling. By synthesizing insights from both domains, this research seeks to advance theoretical constructs, methodologies, and practical applications that address complex challenges in neuroscience and related fields. The anticipated impact includes improved educational approaches, innovative neurotechnologies, and enhanced predictive models that redefine our understanding of brain function and decision-making.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of PME and Neuroscience represents a groundbreaking shift in how we understand cognitive processes. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge across disciplines to enhance predictive capabilities, while Neuroscience explores the intricacies of the nervous system. This dissertation will investigate how these two fields can inform and enrich one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional views of the brain as a passive receiver of information, proposing instead that it functions as an active predictive engine. By recontextualizing existing theories and methodologies, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm that could revolutionize both neuroscience and predictive modeling.
