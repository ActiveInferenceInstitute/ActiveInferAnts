# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystems into Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of biological ecosystems and logistics, creating a new interdisciplinary field that leverages ecological principles to enhance supply chain management. By examining the interconnectedness, resilience, and adaptability inherent in biological systems, this research seeks to develop novel frameworks and methodologies that can transform logistics practices. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine efficiency, sustainability, and responsiveness in logistics networks, ultimately leading to a more resilient and adaptive supply chain ecosystem.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of biological ecosystem principles into logistics represents a paradigm shift in understanding supply chain dynamics. Historically, logistics has focused on efficiency and cost reduction, often neglecting the interconnectedness and resilience found in natural systems. This research will explore how ecological concepts can be translated into logistics practices, fostering a new approach to supply chain management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally separate fields, offering fresh insights and methodologies that can enhance operational efficiency and sustainability in logistics. By applying ecological principles, this work aims to contribute to the development of resilient logistics networks that can better adapt to market fluctuations and disruptions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from biological ecosystems be effectively integrated into logistics management?
2. What are the potential benefits of adopting an ecosystemic approach to logistics in terms of resilience and efficiency?
3. How can the identification of keystone players in logistics networks enhance overall system performance?
4. What novel methodologies can be developed to monitor and optimize logistics networks based on ecological principles?
