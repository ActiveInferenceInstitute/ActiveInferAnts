# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystems onto Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the Shifted Domain that merges biological ecosystems with logistics, aiming to develop an innovative framework for enhancing supply chain resilience, sustainability, and efficiency. By applying ecological principles to logistics networks, this research seeks to reveal the transformative potential of viewing logistics as an ecosystem. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both academic discourse and practical applications within the logistics industry, impacting policy, education, and technological advancements.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of biology and logistics presents a unique opportunity to rethink traditional supply chain management approaches. By understanding logistics through the lens of biological ecosystems, we can identify parallels that may lead to more adaptive and resilient systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional logistics paradigms and introduces ecological principles as a framework for addressing contemporary supply chain challenges. The novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging two fields that have traditionally operated independently.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecological principles enhance the resilience and efficiency of logistics networks?
2. What metrics can be developed to assess the impact of biodiversity in supply chains?
3. How can logistics practices be transformed through the adoption of ecosystem-inspired strategies?
