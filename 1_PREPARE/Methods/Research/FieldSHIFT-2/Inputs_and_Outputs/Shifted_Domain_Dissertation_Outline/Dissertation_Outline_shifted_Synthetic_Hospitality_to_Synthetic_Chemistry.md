# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Chemistry through Guest Experience Principles from Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into the field of chemistry, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines how chemical reactions and interactions are understood and optimized. By treating molecules as "guests" within their environments, this research seeks to develop personalized catalytic systems and enhance the sustainability of chemical processes. This transformative approach holds the potential to revolutionize both the hospitality and chemical industries, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative practices that address global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalization, emotional engagement, and quality service. Conversely, the field of chemistry has traditionally prioritized quantitative analysis and the study of matter's properties. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that merges these two domains, offering a new perspective on molecular interactions and reaction design.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to redefine chemical education and practice by incorporating qualitative, experience-based methodologies. It opens new avenues for innovation in sustainable chemistry and personalized catalysis, contributing to both academic knowledge and practical applications in industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be applied to optimize chemical reactions?
2. What are the implications of treating molecules as guests in their environments?
3. How can personalized data analytics enhance catalytic processes?
