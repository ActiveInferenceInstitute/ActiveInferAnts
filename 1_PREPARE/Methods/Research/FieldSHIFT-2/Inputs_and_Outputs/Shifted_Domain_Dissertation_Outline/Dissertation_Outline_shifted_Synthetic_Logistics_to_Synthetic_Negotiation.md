# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Shifted Domain of Logistics into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of logistics and negotiation, proposing a transformative framework that applies core logistics principles to enhance negotiation strategies. By analyzing the operational efficiencies, collaborative practices, and risk management techniques inherent in logistics, the research aims to redefine negotiation dynamics, moving from competitive paradigms to collaborative engagements. The anticipated outcomes include the development of practical models and tools that enhance negotiation efficacy, foster sustainable partnerships, and promote interdisciplinary education. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both fields, offering new insights and methodologies that can be applied across industries and cultures.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of logistics and negotiation represents a novel approach to understanding and improving interactions between parties. Logistics, traditionally focused on the optimization of supply chains, emphasizes efficiency, coordination, and risk management. In contrast, negotiation has been predominantly viewed through a competitive lens, often characterized by zero-sum outcomes. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by proposing that the principles of logistics can inform and enhance negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional negotiation paradigms and introduces a fresh perspective that emphasizes collaboration and efficiency. By leveraging logistics methodologies, the study aims to uncover new strategies that can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes in negotiations, thus addressing existing gaps in both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can logistics principles be systematically applied to enhance negotiation strategies?
- What are the potential benefits of a collaborative approach to negotiation informed by logistics practices?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of logistics and negotiation?
