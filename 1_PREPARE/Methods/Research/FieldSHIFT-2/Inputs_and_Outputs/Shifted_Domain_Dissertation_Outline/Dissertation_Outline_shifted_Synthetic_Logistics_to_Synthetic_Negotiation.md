# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Logistics to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of logistics principles into negotiation processes, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework termed "Logistics-Informed Negotiation." By examining the core principles, methodologies, and challenges of both logistics and negotiation, this research aims to demonstrate how logistics can enhance negotiation outcomes through improved efficiency, coordination, and data-driven decision-making. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation practices across various sectors, from international trade to humanitarian efforts, thereby fostering more sustainable and mutually beneficial agreements.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of logistics, which focuses on the efficient movement and storage of goods, and negotiation, which centers on reaching agreements through dialogue. Historically viewed as separate disciplines, this integration reveals shared principles such as coordination and efficiency, offering new insights into both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the gaps in negotiation strategies by introducing logistics principles that can optimize negotiation processes. The novelty of this work lies in its interdisciplinary approach, proposing a new framework that combines the strengths of both domains.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles improve negotiation outcomes in various contexts?
2. What methodologies can be developed to integrate logistics and negotiation effectively?
3. What are the implications of this integration for education, industry, and policy?
