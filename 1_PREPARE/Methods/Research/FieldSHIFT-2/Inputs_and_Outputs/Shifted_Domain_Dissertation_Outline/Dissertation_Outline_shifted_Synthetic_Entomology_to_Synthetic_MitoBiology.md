## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The study of entomology has historically focused on the ecological and evolutionary aspects of insects, while mitochondrial biology has centered on cellular energy dynamics and dysfunction. This dissertation posits that integrating these two fields can yield transformative insights into both insect behavior and mitochondrial function.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between disciplines, offering a fresh perspective on mitochondrial dynamics by utilizing concepts from entomology. The novelty lies in the application of insect-inspired frameworks to understand mitochondrial behavior, potentially leading to groundbreaking findings in cellular biology and therapeutic interventions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of metamorphosis in insects inform our understanding of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics?
2. In what ways do mitochondrial interactions resemble social behaviors observed in insect colonies?
3. What role does chemical signaling play in mitochondrial function, and how can it be conceptualized through the lens of chemical ecology?
