# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Spatial Web to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative fusion of two distinct fields: the Spatial Web, characterized by immersive digital-physical interactions, and Cognitive Security, focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation and misinformation. By examining the synergies between these domains, the research aims to develop a transformative framework that leverages technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance cognitive security education, real-time threat detection, and user resilience against misinformation. This work is expected to yield significant theoretical insights and practical applications, setting the stage for future interdisciplinary research and societal impact.
