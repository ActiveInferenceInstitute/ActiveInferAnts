# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Technology into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology into the preservation and management of traditional knowledge. By establishing decentralized knowledge networks, transparent repositories, and smart contracts, this research will provide innovative solutions to empower indigenous communities and safeguard cultural heritage. The significance of this work lies in its ability to create a new paradigm for knowledge management that respects and enhances traditional practices, while also addressing contemporary challenges such as globalization and cultural appropriation. Ultimately, this dissertation seeks to contribute to the creation of a decentralized cultural economy that recognizes and monetizes traditional knowledge in an ethical manner.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of blockchain technology and traditional knowledge represents a groundbreaking shift in how cultural practices and knowledge systems can be preserved, shared, and valued. Blockchain, with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, offers a robust framework for addressing the challenges faced by traditional knowledge systems, which are often vulnerable to loss and misrepresentation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from technology, anthropology, and indigenous studies. It aims to develop a theoretical framework that not only enhances the preservation of traditional knowledge but also empowers communities by providing them with the tools to manage and monetize their cultural heritage.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology be effectively integrated into the preservation of traditional knowledge?
2. What are the potential impacts of decentralized knowledge networks on community empowerment and cultural resilience?
3. How can tokenization of traditional practices be developed to ensure fair compensation and recognition for indigenous communities?
