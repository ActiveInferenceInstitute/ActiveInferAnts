# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Blockchain Technology with Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology with traditional knowledge systems. By examining the intersection of these two distinct domains, the research aims to develop frameworks that enhance the preservation, protection, and economic empowerment of indigenous communities. The significance of this work lies in its ability to address contemporary challenges faced by traditional knowledge holders, such as cultural appropriation and marginalization, while leveraging blockchain's inherent qualities of decentralization, immutability, and transparency. The anticipated impact includes the creation of decentralized knowledge repositories, equitable compensation mechanisms through smart contracts, and a new lexicon for understanding this integration. This dissertation will contribute to both theoretical advancements and practical applications, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research and collaboration.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of blockchain technology with traditional knowledge represents a groundbreaking shift that merges two previously distinct fields. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger technology, has gained prominence for its applications in various sectors, including finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Conversely, traditional knowledge encompasses the cultural practices, innovations, and understandings developed by indigenous communities over generations. This dissertation seeks to understand how blockchain can serve as a tool for preserving and empowering traditional knowledge systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need to protect traditional knowledge from appropriation and misrepresentation while providing indigenous communities with the tools to assert ownership over their cultural practices. By leveraging blockchain's capabilities, this dissertation proposes a novel approach to safeguarding cultural heritage and promoting economic opportunities for indigenous peoples.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can blockchain technology enhance the preservation and protection of traditional knowledge?
- What frameworks can be developed to ensure equitable compensation for indigenous communities when their knowledge is utilized commercially?
- How can decentralized platforms for sharing traditional knowledge foster collaboration between indigenous communities and external stakeholders?

## Literature Review
