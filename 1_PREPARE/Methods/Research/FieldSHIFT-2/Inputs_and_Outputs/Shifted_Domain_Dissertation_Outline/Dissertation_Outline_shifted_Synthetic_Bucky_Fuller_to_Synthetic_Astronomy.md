# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Buckminster Fuller’s innovative principles—such as holistic thinking, ephemeralization, tensegrity, and synergetics—into the field of astronomy. By fusing these two distinct domains, the research seeks to develop novel frameworks that enhance our understanding of the universe, propose sustainable practices in space exploration, and create interdisciplinary educational approaches. The anticipated impact includes advancements in astronomical research methodologies, the design of adaptable space structures, and a shift towards sustainable practices in the management of celestial resources.
