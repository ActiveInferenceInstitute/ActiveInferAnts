This research is significant as it challenges traditional biomedical models by integrating patient-centered approaches into mitochondrial health. The novelty lies in the application of healthcare methodologies to mitochondrial research, potentially leading to personalized therapies and improved health outcomes. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to redefine our understanding of health and disease, particularly in the context of chronic illnesses.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to mitochondrial research to enhance therapeutic outcomes?
2. What metrics can be established to evaluate mitochondrial health analogous to healthcare service quality indicators?
3. How can community engagement initiatives be designed to promote awareness and prevention of mitochondrial diseases?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of healthcare has shifted from paternalistic models to patient-centered approaches, emphasizing the importance of the patient-provider relationship. Concurrently, mitochondrial research has transitioned from a focus solely on energy production to a broader understanding of mitochondrial roles in health and disease.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current healthcare practices prioritize holistic care, integrating technology and community engagement. In mitochondrial research, there is growing recognition of the importance of mitochondrial dynamics and their implications for diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic syndromes.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements in both fields, there remains a gap in integrating healthcare methodologies with mitochondrial research. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring how concepts from healthcare can inform mitochondrial health and vice versa.
