## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking framework that integrates principles from health care into the domain of ATM transactions. By reimagining the ATM user experience through a patient-centered lens, the research aims to enhance user satisfaction, security, and accessibility. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize how financial institutions engage with customers, ultimately leading to a more equitable banking landscape. The dissertation will explore the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, and interdisciplinary implications of this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of health care principles into ATM transactions represents a novel approach to enhancing user experience in financial services. Traditionally, ATMs have focused on efficiency and security, often neglecting the emotional and psychological aspects of user interaction. By borrowing concepts from health care, such as personalized care and holistic support, this research seeks to address these shortcomings.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms in both health care and banking. It highlights the importance of user experience in financial transactions and proposes a transformative model that prioritizes customer needs. The novelty lies in the systematic application of health care principles to a domain that has been largely overlooked in terms of user-centered design.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can health care principles be effectively transposed to enhance the ATM user experience?
2. What are the key factors influencing user satisfaction and security in ATM transactions?
3. How can the proposed model improve accessibility for diverse populations?
4. What interdisciplinary collaborations can be established to further this research?
