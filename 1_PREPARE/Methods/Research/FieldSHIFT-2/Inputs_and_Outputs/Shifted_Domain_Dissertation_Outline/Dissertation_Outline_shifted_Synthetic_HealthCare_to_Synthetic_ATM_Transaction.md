# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating patient experience principles from healthcare into the realm of ATM transactions. By fusing these two distinct domains, the research aims to enhance user experience (UX) in banking services, leading to improved satisfaction, accessibility, and operational efficiency. The significance of this study lies in its innovative approach to user-centered design, which not only addresses current challenges in ATM interactions but also sets the stage for a broader reimagining of financial services. The anticipated impact includes a paradigm shift in how users engage with banking technologies, fostering a culture of empathy and personalization.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain focuses on the intersection of healthcare and banking, specifically the application of patient experience (PX) principles to ATM transactions. Healthcare has long embraced a patient-centered approach, while banking often prioritizes efficiency over user satisfaction. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these domains, leveraging insights from healthcare to enhance the ATM experience.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, applying established healthcare principles to improve banking services. This study not only addresses existing challenges in ATM usability but also proposes a new framework for understanding user interactions in financial services. The implications extend beyond ATM transactions, potentially influencing broader banking practices and policies.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles be effectively integrated into ATM design and functionality?
2. What impact does a personalized ATM experience have on user satisfaction and transaction efficiency?
3. How can feedback mechanisms from healthcare improve the continuous enhancement of ATM services?

# Literature Review
## Historical Context of the Original Domains
### Health Care
The evolution of healthcare has been marked by a shift towards patient-centered care, emphasizing the importance of patient engagement and satisfaction. Key developments include the establishment of quality metrics and the integration of technology in patient interactions.

### ATM Transactions
The history of ATMs reflects advancements in self-service banking, with a focus on convenience and security. However, user experience has often been secondary to operational efficiency, leading to challenges in accessibility and personalization.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
### Health Care
Current literature emphasizes the role of patient experience in improving health outcomes, with studies demonstrating the positive correlation between PX and service quality.

### ATM Transactions
Research on ATM usability highlights issues such as complex interfaces and accessibility barriers, suggesting a need for user-centered design improvements.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the growing recognition of user experience in both fields, there remains a significant gap in applying healthcare principles to banking. This presents an opportunity to innovate ATM design and enhance user satisfaction through a holistic approach.

# Theoretical Framework
## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
### Patient-Centered Care Theory
This theory emphasizes the importance of understanding and addressing individual patient needs, preferences, and values.

### User Experience Theory
This theory focuses on the overall satisfaction and interaction of users with products, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and emotional responses.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
### Personalized User Experience Framework
This framework integrates principles of patient-centered care with user experience design, proposing a model for creating personalized interactions in ATMs.

### Holistic Service Quality Model
This model extends traditional service quality metrics to encompass both functional and emotional aspects of user interactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines patient-centered care principles with user experience design to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing ATM transactions.
