## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the fusion of mitochondrial biology and financial technology, specifically the mechanisms governing ATM transactions. Mitochondria, known as the powerhouse of the cell, play critical roles in energy production and cellular health. In contrast, ATMs serve as vital nodes in the banking ecosystem, facilitating financial transactions for consumers. This dissertation seeks to bridge these fields by applying biological principles to enhance the operational frameworks of ATM networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, offering fresh perspectives on both mitochondrial biology and financial technology. By drawing parallels between cellular processes and transaction systems, the study aims to uncover novel insights that can lead to improved ATM functionalities, security measures, and user satisfaction. The novelty lies in the application of biological concepts to a traditionally technological domain, paving the way for innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in ATM operations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can mitochondrial dynamics inform the management of ATM networks?
2. In what ways can principles of energy production and mitophagy enhance transaction integrity and system efficiency?
