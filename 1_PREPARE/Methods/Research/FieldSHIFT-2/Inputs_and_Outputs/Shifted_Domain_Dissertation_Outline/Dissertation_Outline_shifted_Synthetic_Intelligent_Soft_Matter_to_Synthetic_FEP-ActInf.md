# PhD Dissertation Plan: Intelligent Soft Matter within the Framework of Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of Intelligent Soft Matter (ISM) with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By analyzing the adaptive capabilities of soft materials through the lens of predictive coding and variational free energy, this research seeks to redefine our understanding of agency in both biological and non-biological systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize material science, robotics, and cognitive science, leading to advancements in smart technologies, healthcare, and sustainable practices. The outcome will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also offer practical applications that address pressing societal challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of Intelligent Soft Matter and the Free Energy Principle represents a transformative shift in how we understand material responsiveness and cognitive adaptability. ISM leverages principles from materials science, engineering, and biology, while FEP provides a framework for understanding adaptive behavior in living systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it challenges traditional distinctions between material and cognitive agency. By treating intelligent soft materials as predictive agents, we can develop a new paradigm that integrates physical and cognitive processes, enhancing our understanding of both domains.
