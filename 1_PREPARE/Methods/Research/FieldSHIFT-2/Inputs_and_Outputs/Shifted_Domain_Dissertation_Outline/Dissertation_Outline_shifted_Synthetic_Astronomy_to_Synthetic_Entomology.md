## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of astronomy and entomology, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Astronomy, the study of celestial bodies and phenomena, provides rich observational and theoretical frameworks, while entomology focuses on the study of insects, their behaviors, and their ecological roles. This dissertation posits that cross-pollination of concepts and methodologies between these fields can yield transformative insights.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to the urgent need for innovative approaches to biodiversity conservation and ecological understanding in the face of climate change and habitat destruction. By applying astronomical methods to entomological studies, we can enhance our ability to monitor and understand insect populations on a larger scale, potentially uncovering patterns and relationships that remain obscured within traditional frameworks.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can astronomical observation techniques be adapted for monitoring insect populations?
2. What theoretical models from astronomy can inform our understanding of insect population dynamics?
3. In what ways can the integration of these two fields lead to novel conservation strategies and ecological insights?
