# PhD Dissertation Plan: Cognitive Security Meets Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles with neuroscience, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances our understanding of cognitive processes and resilience against misinformation. By examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive biases and misinformation processing, this research seeks to develop innovative interventions that bolster cognitive resilience. The anticipated impact spans multiple fields, including psychology, information science, and public policy, paving the way for new educational frameworks and technological applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of cognitive security and neuroscience. Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from misinformation and manipulation, while neuroscience investigates the biological underpinnings of cognition. This fusion offers a unique opportunity to understand how misinformation affects neural functioning and decision-making.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it provides a comprehensive framework for examining the neural basis of cognitive vulnerabilities and resilience. By integrating insights from both fields, we can develop targeted interventions that enhance cognitive health and decision-making in an increasingly complex information landscape.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How do neural circuits adapt in response to exposure to misinformation?
2. What are the neural correlates of cognitive biases, and how can they be modulated?
3. How can cognitive resilience be fostered through interventions informed by cognitive security principles?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cognitive Security:** Emerged in response to the digital age, focusing on the protection of cognitive processes against misinformation.
