# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Physical Security to Intelligent Security Architecture

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative shift from traditional physical security measures to an integrated framework of Intelligent Security Architecture (ISA). This shift represents a critical evolution in how security is conceptualized and implemented, merging physical and cybersecurity into a cohesive strategy. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize security practices, enhance safety across various environments, and address emerging threats in an increasingly digital world. By investigating the theoretical, methodological, and practical implications of ISA, this dissertation will contribute valuable insights into the future of security systems and their impact on society.

## Introduction
