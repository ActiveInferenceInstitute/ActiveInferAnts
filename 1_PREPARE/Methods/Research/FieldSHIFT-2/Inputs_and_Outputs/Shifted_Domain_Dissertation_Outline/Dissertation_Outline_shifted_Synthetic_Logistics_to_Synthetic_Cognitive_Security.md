# PhD Dissertation Plan: Cognitive Security as a Shifted Domain from Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a novel framework for understanding cognitive security through principles derived from logistics. By integrating concepts such as supply chain management, risk management, and technology utilization, this research aims to enhance the integrity and resilience of information flow in the digital landscape. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize cognitive security practices, addressing the pervasive challenges of misinformation and cognitive biases. This interdisciplinary approach promises to create new pathways for both theoretical exploration and practical application, ultimately contributing to a more secure information environment.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of logistics and cognitive security represents a transformative shift in how we understand and manage information integrity. Logistics focuses on the efficient movement and storage of goods, while cognitive security addresses the protection of cognitive processes from manipulation. The intersection of these two fields offers a unique perspective on managing information flows, akin to supply chain management in logistics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to bridge the gap between operational efficiency in logistics and the protective measures in cognitive security. By transposing logistics principles into cognitive security, we can create a robust framework for enhancing information integrity, fostering collaboration among stakeholders, and developing innovative solutions to combat misinformation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into cognitive security practices?
- What are the implications of a cognitive supply chain model for enhancing information integrity?
- How does Just-in-Time information delivery influence cognitive biases and decision-making?
