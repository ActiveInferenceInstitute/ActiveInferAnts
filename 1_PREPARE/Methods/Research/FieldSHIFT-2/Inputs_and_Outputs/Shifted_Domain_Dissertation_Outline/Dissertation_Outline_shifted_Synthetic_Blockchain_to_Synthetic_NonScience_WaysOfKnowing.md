# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Technology into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology with non-science ways of knowing, creating a novel interdisciplinary domain. By leveraging blockchain's principles of decentralization, immutability, transparency, and smart contracts, this research seeks to empower communities to preserve their cultural narratives, enhance cross-cultural understanding, and formalize traditional practices. The anticipated impact of this work extends beyond academic discourse, offering practical applications in cultural preservation, community governance, and societal equity.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of blockchain technology has revolutionized various sectors by providing decentralized, secure, and transparent systems for information sharing. Meanwhile, non-science ways of knowing, which prioritize subjective experiences and cultural narratives, have been historically marginalized. This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these two domains, recognizing the potential for blockchain to enhance the preservation and sharing of non-scientific knowledge.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the gap between scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems, promoting inclusivity and diversity in knowledge representation. The novelty lies in applying blockchain technology to cultural contexts, creating a framework that respects and empowers marginalized voices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can blockchain technology be effectively integrated into non-science ways of knowing to enhance cultural preservation?
- What are the implications of decentralized storytelling platforms on cross-cultural understanding?
- In what ways can smart contracts formalize traditional practices and governance in communities?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Trace the evolution from Bitcoin to diverse applications in finance and supply chain management.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Explore the historical marginalization of indigenous and cultural knowledge systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review current blockchain applications and their implications for decentralization and transparency.
- Examine contemporary discussions on the value of non-scientific knowledge in academic and cultural contexts.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Highlight opportunities for innovative applications of blockchain in cultural preservation and community engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Theories of decentralization, trust, and security.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Theories of cultural narratives, holistic understanding, and subjective experience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Develop a framework that integrates blockchain principles with cultural autonomy and narrative authenticity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Illustrate how blockchain can serve as a mechanism for preserving and sharing non-scientific knowledge while fostering community governance.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative data collection to explore community perspectives and technological applications.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with community members and cultural leaders.
- Case studies of pilot projects utilizing blockchain technology for cultural preservation.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to identify patterns and insights.
- Statistical analysis of survey data to measure community engagement and knowledge retention.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensure informed consent and respect for cultural sensitivities in all research activities.
- Develop guidelines for the ethical use of indigenous knowledge in technological applications.
