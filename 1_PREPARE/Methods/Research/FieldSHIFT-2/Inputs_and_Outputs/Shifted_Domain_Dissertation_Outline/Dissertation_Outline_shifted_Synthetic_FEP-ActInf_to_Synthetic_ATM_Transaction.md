# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive science, particularly the Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the domain of ATM transactions. By leveraging the theoretical constructs of FEP, the research will propose a framework for optimizing ATM design and user interaction, thereby enhancing transaction efficiency, security, and user satisfaction. The significance of this research lies not only in its potential to revolutionize self-service banking but also in its broader implications for adaptive systems in technology. The outcomes are expected to provide valuable insights into user behavior, inform policy for financial technology, and contribute to the development of new interdisciplinary fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability in their interactions with the environment. ATM transactions, as a self-service banking mechanism, present an opportunity to apply these concepts, optimizing user experiences and operational efficiency.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to applying cognitive science principles to financial technology. By introducing FEP to ATM design, it aims to bridge the gap between human-computer interaction and financial services, creating a more effective and user-friendly banking experience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance ATM transaction efficiency?
2. What role do user expectations and experiences play in the design of ATMs?
3. How can security measures be re-conceptualized to align with the FEP framework?
