# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming ATM Transactions through the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and ATM transactions, proposing a transformative framework that enhances user interaction, operational efficiency, and security in ATM networks. By adapting principles from cognitive science and adaptive systems to the banking sector, this research seeks to redefine the user experience in ATM transactions, making them more intuitive, efficient, and secure. The potential impact of this work extends beyond banking, offering insights applicable to various fields where user interaction and adaptive technologies converge.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems strive to minimize variational free energy, thereby maintaining their structural and functional integrity. In contrast, ATM transactions represent a critical interface between consumers and financial institutions, characterized by user experience challenges and operational inefficiencies. This dissertation will investigate how the principles of FEP and Active Inference can be transposed into the ATM domain to create a novel understanding of user interactions and operational frameworks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct domains—cognitive science and banking technology—creating an interdisciplinary framework that can lead to innovative applications in ATM design and functionality. The novelty lies in applying adaptive system principles to enhance user experience, thereby addressing existing challenges in ATM transactions such as complexity, security, and accessibility.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the Free Energy Principle be applied to redesign ATM networks for improved user interaction?
2. What predictive models can be developed to minimize user frustration and transaction errors?
3. In what ways can adaptive systems enhance the operational efficiency of ATM networks?
