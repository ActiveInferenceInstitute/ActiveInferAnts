# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative integration of non-science ways of knowing—such as intuition, narrative, and cultural beliefs—into the field of physical security. By bridging these previously distinct domains, the research seeks to develop a holistic security framework that enhances effectiveness through emotional intelligence, community engagement, and cultural sensitivity. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic discourse, offering practical applications that can reshape security practices, foster community trust, and contribute to the resilience of societies in the face of evolving threats.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of non-science ways of knowing into physical security represents a paradigm shift that challenges traditional methodologies. This dissertation will examine how diverse methods of understanding can enhance the efficacy of security measures by incorporating human-centric approaches.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to redefine security practices by emphasizing the importance of emotional intelligence and cultural context. It aims to fill a critical gap in the literature by proposing a new framework that combines insights from both domains, ultimately leading to more adaptive and effective security strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing be systematically integrated into physical security practices?
2. What are the implications of this integration for security personnel training and community engagement?
3. How can this new framework address current challenges in physical security, such as evolving threats and privacy concerns?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Historical roots in indigenous knowledge systems, oral traditions, and holistic approaches.
- **Physical Security:** Evolution from basic protective measures to complex systems incorporating technology and human factors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Resurgence of interest in integrating these perspectives into various fields, emphasizing emotional intelligence and cultural context.
- **Physical Security:** Current paradigms focus heavily on technological solutions, often neglecting the human element.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research that merges these domains, presenting an opportunity to explore how non-science ways of knowing can enhance physical security practices.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Non-Science Theories:** Holistic frameworks, indigenous knowledge systems.
- **Physical Security Theories:** Risk management, situational awareness, human factors in security.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Holistic Security Theory:** A framework that integrates emotional, social, and environmental factors into security practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines elements of emotional intelligence, cultural narratives, and community engagement to create a comprehensive security framework.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into physical security.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with security professionals and community members.
- Case studies of organizations that have successfully integrated these approaches.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for quantitative data to measure the effectiveness of integrated practices.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure participant confidentiality, informed consent, and cultural sensitivity throughout the research process.
