# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Neuroscience through Patient-Centered Health Care Principles

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of healthcare and neuroscience, proposing a novel framework that applies patient-centered care principles to the understanding and treatment of neural processes. By redefining neural interactions as analogous to patient experiences, this research aims to enhance cognitive and emotional health outcomes. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and leading to the development of new therapeutic approaches. The findings are expected to have profound implications for education, research, and practical applications in mental health.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The shift from healthcare to neuroscience represents a transformative integration of principles that traditionally existed in isolation. Healthcare emphasizes patient-centered care, service quality, and technology integration, while neuroscience focuses on understanding neural mechanisms, behavior, and cognitive functions. This dissertation posits that merging these domains can yield new insights into brain function and improve mental health outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to redefine how we perceive and study neural processes by applying healthcare principles. The novelty lies in the creation of a framework that not only enhances our understanding of neuroscience but also introduces a new lexicon and methodologies that can bridge gaps between disciplines.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to the study of neural processes?
2. What are the implications of enhancing neural interactions for cognitive and emotional health?
3. How can neurotechnological advancements be utilized to improve patient outcomes in mental health?
