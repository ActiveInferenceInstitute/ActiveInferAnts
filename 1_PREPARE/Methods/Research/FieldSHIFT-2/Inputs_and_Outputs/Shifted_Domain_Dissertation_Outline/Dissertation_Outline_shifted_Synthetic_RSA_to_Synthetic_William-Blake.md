# PhD Dissertation Plan: Intersecting RSA Cryptography with the Life and Work of William Blake

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of RSA cryptography and the life and work of William Blake, two seemingly disparate domains. By analyzing the underlying structures and principles of RSA alongside Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions, the research seeks to uncover new insights into both fields. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine approaches to literary analysis and cryptographic theory, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and offering new frameworks for understanding creativity and encryption. The anticipated outcomes include the development of novel methodologies, educational resources, and applications that bridge the gap between mathematics, art, and spirituality.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of RSA cryptography, a cornerstone of modern digital security, with the life and works of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art, presents a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between mathematical rigor and artistic expression. This dissertation will delve into the historical, theoretical, and practical dimensions of this intersection, illuminating how cryptographic principles can enhance our understanding of Blake's visionary contributions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which combines mathematical frameworks with literary analysis. This study will not only contribute to the fields of cryptography and literature but also propose a new theoretical lens—Blakean Cryptography—that interprets artistic expression as a form of encrypted communication.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of RSA cryptography inform the analysis of William Blake's artistic and literary works?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of these two domains?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach revolutionize education and practical applications in both fields?
