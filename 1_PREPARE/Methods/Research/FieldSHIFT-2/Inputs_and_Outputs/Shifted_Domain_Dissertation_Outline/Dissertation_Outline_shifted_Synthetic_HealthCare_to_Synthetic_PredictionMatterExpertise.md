# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) through Health Care Principles

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating patient-centered care principles from healthcare into the field of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By establishing a framework that prioritizes user experience, quality metrics, and technology-driven solutions, this research will address critical gaps in PME, enhancing its relevance and applicability across various domains. The anticipated impact includes improved predictive accuracy, user satisfaction, and the establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare and data science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of healthcare principles with PME represents a significant paradigm shift. Traditionally, healthcare has focused on patient-centered practices, emphasizing quality, technology integration, and sustainability. Conversely, PME has largely been data-driven, often neglecting user experience and emotional insights. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, creating a novel approach to predictions that is both user-focused and data-informed.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it reimagines PME through the lens of healthcare principles, providing a framework that enhances predictive capabilities while prioritizing user needs. The novelty lies in the introduction of concepts such as "Patient-Centric Predictions" and "Quality Prediction Metrics," which will revolutionize how predictions are made and evaluated.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of patient-centered care enhance the accuracy and applicability of predictions in PME?
2. What quality metrics can be established to measure the effectiveness of predictive models?
3. How can technology facilitate the integration of user feedback into predictive processes?
