# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s design science principles with traditional knowledge systems, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters sustainable practices and ecological resilience. This research seeks to establish a theoretical framework that integrates these two distinct fields, addressing significant gaps in both sustainability science and cultural studies. By proposing new models and methodologies, this dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of how traditional ecological practices can be enhanced through modern design principles, ultimately leading to transformative implications for communities and the environment.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a unique fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s holistic, design-oriented approach with the rich, sustainable practices inherent in traditional knowledge systems. This intersection provides a platform for examining how modern scientific principles can enhance age-old ecological wisdom, promoting sustainability in a rapidly changing world.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a novel perspective on sustainability, emphasizing the importance of integrating traditional knowledge with contemporary scientific methodologies. This approach not only honors cultural heritage but also enables the development of innovative solutions to pressing environmental challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
