# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Principles into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles into the field of cognitive security. By establishing a Cognitive Negotiation Framework, this research will address the pressing challenges of misinformation and disinformation through collaborative approaches among stakeholders. The significance of this work lies in its ability to enhance cognitive security practices, promote stakeholder engagement, and foster a more informed society. The anticipated impact includes advancing both academic understanding and practical applications in cognitive security, ultimately contributing to societal resilience against cognitive threats.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of negotiation and cognitive security represents a novel approach to understanding and mitigating cognitive threats. Negotiation, traditionally focused on conflict resolution and stakeholder engagement, can provide valuable strategies for addressing the complexities of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it fills a critical gap in both fields by applying negotiation strategies to enhance cognitive security. The novelty lies in the development of a Cognitive Negotiation Framework that reimagines cognitive security practices, emphasizing collaboration, information sharing, and stakeholder engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation strategies enhance collaboration among stakeholders in cognitive security?
2. What best practices exist for training cognitive security professionals in negotiation techniques?
3. How do cultural differences impact negotiation approaches in addressing cognitive threats?
4. To develop a comprehensive Cognitive Negotiation Framework that integrates negotiation strategies into cognitive security practices.
