# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Integration of Chemistry and Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles from chemistry into health care, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that enhances patient engagement, treatment adherence, and overall health outcomes. By modeling patient interactions as chemical reactions, this research seeks to develop innovative strategies for chronic disease management, patient motivation, and the utilization of technology in health care. The findings will have significant implications for both fields, paving the way for new sub-disciplines and practical applications that can revolutionize health care delivery.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of chemistry and health care presents a unique opportunity to apply scientific principles to improve patient interactions and health outcomes. By understanding health care through the lens of chemical reactions, we can develop models that better reflect the complexities of patient care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only bridges two traditionally distinct fields but also proposes a new paradigm for understanding health care processes. The novelty lies in the application of chemical concepts, such as catalysis and equilibrium, to enhance patient engagement and treatment adherence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can chemical reaction models be applied to patient interactions in health care?
2. What role do catalytic interventions play in improving patient outcomes and adherence?
3. How can thermodynamic principles inform our understanding of patient motivation and behavior change?
