# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Mitochondrial Biology to the Study of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of mitochondrial biology and the study of Hymenoptera, revealing transformative insights into energy management, adaptation, and health maintenance in biological systems. By identifying isomorphisms between mitochondrial functions and the social behaviors of Hymenoptera, this research will propose new theoretical constructs and practical applications, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of both fields. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing ecological management, agricultural practices, and educational curricula.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The study of mitochondria has traditionally focused on their role in cellular energy production, metabolism, and related pathologies. In contrast, Hymenoptera, including ants, bees, and wasps, have been studied primarily for their complex social structures and ecological significance. This dissertation posits that there are significant parallels between these two domains that can lead to novel insights and applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a unique perspective on energy management and social behavior. By transposing concepts from mitochondrial biology to the study of Hymenoptera, the dissertation will uncover new avenues for research and application, challenging existing paradigms in both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can mitochondrial functions inform our understanding of energy management and efficiency in Hymenoptera?
2. What parallels exist between mitochondrial dynamics and the adaptive strategies of ant colonies?
3. In what ways can the concept of mitophagy be applied to the health maintenance of social insect colonies?
