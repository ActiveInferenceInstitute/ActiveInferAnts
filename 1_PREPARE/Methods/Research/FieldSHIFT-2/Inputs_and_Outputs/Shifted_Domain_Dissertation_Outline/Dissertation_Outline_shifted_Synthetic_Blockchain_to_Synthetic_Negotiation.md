# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Principles to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of blockchain principles into negotiation practices, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances transparency, trust, and efficiency in negotiations. By developing new theoretical models and practical frameworks, this research seeks to revolutionize traditional negotiation methodologies, addressing current challenges such as power imbalances and lack of transparency. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both the fields of blockchain technology and negotiation, paving the way for interdisciplinary collaboration and new sub-disciplines.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of blockchain technology and negotiation practices represents a transformative opportunity to address longstanding issues in negotiation, such as trust deficits and power imbalances. Blockchain's decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature provides a framework for rethinking how negotiations are conducted, documented, and enforced.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only proposes a novel approach to negotiation but also opens pathways for interdisciplinary studies between technology and social sciences. The integration of blockchain can lead to improved negotiation outcomes, enhanced trust among parties, and the development of new negotiation paradigms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain principles be effectively integrated into negotiation processes?
2. What new theoretical models can be developed to enhance negotiation practices using blockchain?
3. What are the practical implications of this integration for various industries?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Emerged with Bitcoin in 2008, evolving into a multifaceted technology with applications across industries.
- **Negotiation:** Transitioned from adversarial approaches to integrative strategies focusing on mutual benefit.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Blockchain is recognized for its potential to enhance security and transparency in transactions.
- Negotiation literature emphasizes interpersonal skills and the importance of trust, often lacking in technological integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- The intersection of these fields is underexplored, with limited research on how blockchain can mitigate negotiation challenges. This presents an opportunity for groundbreaking research.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Principles of decentralization, immutability, and consensus mechanisms.
- **Negotiation:** Theories of integrative negotiation and trust-building.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Blockchain-Enhanced Negotiation Model (BENM):** A framework that incorporates blockchain principles into negotiation practices.
- **Consensus Negotiation Framework (CNF):** A structured process requiring consensus among all parties.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines blockchain principles with negotiation strategies to create a framework for transparent and equitable negotiations.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of blockchain in negotiation.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiation experts and blockchain developers.
- Case studies of organizations implementing blockchain in their negotiation processes.

### Analytical Approaches
- Qualitative analysis of interview data to identify themes and insights.
- Quantitative analysis of survey data to measure the effectiveness of blockchain-enhanced negotiation practices.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent, particularly when discussing sensitive negotiation practices.
