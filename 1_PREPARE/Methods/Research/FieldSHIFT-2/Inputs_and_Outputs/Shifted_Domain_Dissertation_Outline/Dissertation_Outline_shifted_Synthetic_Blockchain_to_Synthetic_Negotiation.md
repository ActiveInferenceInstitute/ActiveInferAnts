# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Principles to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of blockchain technology into negotiation practices, creating a Shifted Domain that combines the decentralized, transparent, and immutable characteristics of blockchain with the traditionally centralized and subjective nature of negotiation. By developing a comprehensive framework for decentralized negotiation platforms and smart contracts, this research seeks to revolutionize negotiation processes, enhance trust, and improve outcomes across various fields. The potential impact of this research extends to legal, business, and diplomatic negotiations, promising to transform how agreements are reached and enforced.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of blockchain technology has disrupted numerous industries by introducing decentralization, transparency, and security. Negotiation, on the other hand, has historically relied on human interaction, subjective judgment, and centralized authority. This dissertation examines the intersection of these two domains, proposing a new paradigm for negotiation that leverages blockchain principles to address existing challenges and enhance the negotiation process.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine negotiation practices through the application of blockchain technology. By creating decentralized negotiation platforms and utilizing smart contracts, this research not only contributes to the academic literature but also offers practical solutions to real-world negotiation challenges. The novelty of this research stems from its interdisciplinary approach, merging insights from blockchain technology, negotiation theory, and behavioral economics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain principles be effectively integrated into negotiation practices?
2. What are the implications of decentralized negotiation platforms on trust and transparency among parties?
3. How do smart contracts influence negotiation efficiency and compliance?
4. What new theoretical models can be developed to understand this Shifted Domain?
