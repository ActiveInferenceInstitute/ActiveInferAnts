The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize how we authenticate information, fostering a culture of trust and verification that is critical in today's information-saturated environment. The proposed research will not only contribute to the academic discourse but also have real-world implications for industries, policy, and society as a whole.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an intersection between RSA Cryptography, a cornerstone of secure digital communication, and Cognitive Security, which addresses the vulnerabilities of human cognition to misinformation. As the digital landscape evolves, the need for robust mechanisms to ensure the integrity of information has never been more critical. By integrating the mathematical rigor of RSA with the psychological insights of Cognitive Security, this research aims to create a comprehensive framework that enhances our defenses against cognitive threats.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses two pressing issues: the increasing sophistication of misinformation campaigns and the limitations of current cognitive security measures. By leveraging cryptographic principles, this dissertation proposes novel solutions that could transform how we authenticate and validate information. The novelty lies in the application of RSA mechanisms to cognitive processes, creating a new paradigm for information security that extends beyond traditional boundaries.
