# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Guest Experience to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection between guest experience in hospitality and negotiation practices. By integrating principles from both domains, the research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances negotiation outcomes through personalization, emotional intelligence, and service quality. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation strategies, fostering collaborative environments that prioritize mutual benefit and ethical considerations. The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications across various sectors, including business, diplomacy, and education.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on creating exceptional guest experiences through personalized service, technology integration, and sustainability. Conversely, negotiation has traditionally been viewed as a competitive process, often resulting in win-lose scenarios. This dissertation posits that by merging these two distinct fields, we can create a new paradigm for negotiation that emphasizes collaboration and relationship-building.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional view of negotiation and introduces a fresh perspective that prioritizes the human element. The novelty lies in applying hospitality principles to negotiation, thereby enhancing emotional intelligence, personalization, and service quality in negotiations.
