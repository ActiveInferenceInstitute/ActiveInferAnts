# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative Shifted Domain that merges Guest Experience and Negotiation, aiming to redefine negotiation processes through the lens of hospitality principles. The research examines how personalization, service quality, technology integration, sustainability, and environmental considerations can enhance negotiation outcomes. By proposing a comprehensive theoretical framework and empirical studies, this dissertation endeavors to contribute significantly to both fields, offering practical applications and paving the way for future interdisciplinary research.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain of Guest Experience and Negotiation represents a groundbreaking intersection of hospitality and negotiation studies. Traditional negotiation frameworks often focus on transactional outcomes, while the guest experience emphasizes relational and experiential dimensions. This dissertation seeks to bridge these paradigms, proposing that negotiation can be enhanced by adopting principles from the guest experience.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional negotiation strategies by introducing a hospitality-based perspective. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of guest experience principles into negotiation, creating new theoretical constructs and practical applications that have the potential to revolutionize both fields.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can personalization in negotiation strategies impact outcomes and satisfaction?
2. What role does the quality of interaction play in fostering long-term relationships in negotiation?
3. How can technology and environmental factors enhance negotiation experiences?

# Literature Review
## Historical Context of the Original Domains
A review of the historical development of guest experience in hospitality and negotiation reveals distinct trajectories, with hospitality focusing on service delivery and customer satisfaction, while negotiation has traditionally emphasized strategy and outcome.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research highlights the importance of effective communication in negotiation and the critical role of service quality in hospitality. However, there is limited exploration of how these domains can inform one another.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature indicates a gap in integrating hospitality principles into negotiation strategies. This research aims to fill this gap by identifying isomorphisms between the two domains and proposing a novel framework for negotiation.

# Theoretical Framework
## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service Quality Theory**: Emphasizes the importance of meeting customer expectations.
- **Negotiation Theory**: Focuses on strategies for achieving favorable outcomes.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Negotiation Experience Model**: Proposes that negotiation can be viewed as an experiential process similar to guest experiences in hospitality.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integration of service quality, personalization, and environmental factors into a cohesive model that enhances negotiation processes and outcomes.

# Methodology
## Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the Shifted Domain comprehensively.

## Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiators and hospitality professionals.
- Case studies of successful negotiations that incorporate guest experience principles.

## Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to test hypotheses.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

## Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and integrity in research practices.
