# Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative transposition of mitochondrial biology into the framework of the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a novel interdisciplinary approach that bridges cellular metabolism and cognitive science. Through a comprehensive analysis of key concepts from both domains, this research seeks to uncover isomorphisms that illuminate the parallels between energy production in mitochondria and predictive coding in cognitive systems. The findings are expected to have profound implications for understanding adaptive systems, informing new therapeutic strategies, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. This work will not only advance theoretical knowledge but also offer practical applications in health, education, and technology.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection of mitochondrial biology and the Free Energy Principle. Mitochondria are vital organelles responsible for energy production and metabolic regulation, while the FEP provides a theoretical framework for understanding how adaptive systems maintain equilibrium in the face of environmental variability. By integrating these two fields, we can gain insights into how biological systems optimize energy usage and cognitive processing.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between biology and cognitive science. By framing mitochondrial processes within the context of the FEP, we can explore new models of understanding that reflect the complexity of living systems. The novelty lies in the proposed isomorphisms and the development of an integrated theoretical model that can be applied to both biological and cognitive domains.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can mitochondrial function be conceptualized through the lens of the Free Energy Principle?
2. What are the implications of mitochondrial dynamics for predictive coding and active inference in cognitive systems?
3. How can insights from this interdisciplinary approach inform therapeutic strategies for metabolic and cognitive disorders?
