# PhD Dissertation Plan: Mitochondrial Dynamics and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of mitochondrial dynamics and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through a comprehensive investigation of their interconnections and implications. By transposing concepts from mitochondrial biology into the framework of the FEP, this research seeks to develop a novel theoretical model that elucidates how cellular processes align with cognitive functions, thereby providing insights into health, disease, and adaptive behavior. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of biological systems, inform therapeutic strategies, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration across biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The mitochondrion is a crucial organelle responsible for energy production, metabolic regulation, and cellular signaling.
