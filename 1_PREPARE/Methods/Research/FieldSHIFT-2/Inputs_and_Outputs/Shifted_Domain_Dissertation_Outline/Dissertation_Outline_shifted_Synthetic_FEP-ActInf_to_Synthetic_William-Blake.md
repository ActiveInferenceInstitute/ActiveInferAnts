# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) with the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in the Romantic Age. By transposing these cognitive and biological frameworks onto Blake's artistic and spiritual explorations, the research seeks to uncover new insights into the cognitive processes that underpin creative expression. The significance of this study lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of both cognitive science and literary studies, revealing the intricate relationships between creativity, spirituality, and the human experience. The anticipated impact includes the development of novel theoretical constructs, interdisciplinary collaborations, and practical applications in education and the arts.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference are grounded in systems biology and cognitive neuroscience, positing that living systems minimize free energy to maintain their integrity. In contrast, William Blake's oeuvre reflects a profound engagement with themes of duality, spirituality, and the tension between imagination and reason. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that interweaves these two domains, offering fresh perspectives on cognitive processes in artistic creation.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it bridges cognitive science and literary studies, revealing how Blake's artistic practices can inform our understanding of cognitive mechanisms. The novelty lies in applying theories from cognitive neuroscience to interpret Blake's works, suggesting that his creative processes can be viewed through the lens of minimizing spiritual free energy and active inference.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to analyze Blake's artistic and spiritual processes?
2. What insights can this transposition provide into the nature of creativity and cognitive functioning?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform educational practices and technological innovations?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains
The Free Energy Principle has evolved from thermodynamics and information theory, gaining traction in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. William Blake's works emerged during the Romantic period, characterized by a focus on individualism, emotion, and the critique of rationalism.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Recent studies in cognitive neuroscience emphasize predictive coding and the role of generative models in understanding brain function. In literature, Blake's works are often analyzed through historical and thematic lenses, with limited engagement from cognitive perspectives.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
While both fields have rich histories, there is a notable gap in interdisciplinary research that combines cognitive frameworks with literary analysis. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by exploring how cognitive processes can illuminate Blake's creative practices.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Free Energy Principle**: Living systems minimize surprise and uncertainty through predictive coding.
- **Active Inference**: Organisms act to confirm their predictions, involving both perceptual and active inference.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Spiritual Free Energy**: A concept that parallels variational free energy in the context of Blake's exploration of spirituality.
- **Visionary Inference**: The cognitive process through which Blake's characters derive deeper truths from their experiences.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The integrated model posits that Blake's artistic and spiritual practices can be understood as processes of minimizing spiritual free energy through active inference, where his dualities serve as a framework for navigating existential uncertainties.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview
The research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with computational modeling to explore patterns in Blake's works.

## Data Collection Methods
- **Textual Analysis**: Close reading of Blake's poetry and visual art.
- **Computational Modeling**: Analyzing patterns of duality and their resolutions in Blake's works.

## Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis**: Identifying recurring themes related to duality and spirituality.
- **Computational Techniques**: Using algorithms to model generative processes in Blake's artistic creation.

## Ethical Considerations
The research will adhere to ethical guidelines in literary analysis, ensuring respect for Blake's intellectual property and the integrity of his work.
