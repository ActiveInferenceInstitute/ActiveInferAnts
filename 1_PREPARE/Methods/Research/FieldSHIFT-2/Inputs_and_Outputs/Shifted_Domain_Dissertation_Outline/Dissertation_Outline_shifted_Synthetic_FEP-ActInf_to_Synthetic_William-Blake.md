# PhD Dissertation Plan: Bridging the Free Energy Principle and William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the life and work of William Blake. By analyzing how Blake's artistic and poetic expressions can be understood through the lens of FEP, this research seeks to uncover new dimensions of his legacy while contributing to a deeper understanding of creativity, cognition, and human experience. The potential impact of this research extends beyond literary studies, promising insights into cognitive science, psychology, and the philosophy of art, thereby fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems act to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through predictive coding and active inference. In contrast, William Blake's work encapsulates a profound exploration of dualities and human experience. This dissertation investigates the potential of integrating these two domains, offering a novel perspective on both FEP and Blake's contributions to art and literature.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges cognitive science and the humanities, presenting a unique framework for understanding artistic creativity and human experience. By applying FEP to Blake's work, the dissertation aims to reveal how artistic expression can function as a mechanism for minimizing variational free energy, providing a fresh lens through which to view both cognitive processes and artistic endeavors.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to analyze William Blakeâ€™s artistic and poetic works?
- In what ways do Blake's themes of duality and complexity reflect the cognitive processes described by FEP?
- What new insights can this interdisciplinary approach offer for understanding creativity and the role of the artist in society?

## Literature Review
