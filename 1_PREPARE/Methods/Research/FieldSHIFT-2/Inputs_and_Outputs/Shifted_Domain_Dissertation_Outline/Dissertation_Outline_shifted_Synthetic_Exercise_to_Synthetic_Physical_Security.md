## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of exercise science and physical security, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Exercise science focuses on physical health, fitness, and well-being, while physical security aims to protect assets and maintain safety. This dissertation will investigate how principles from exercise can inform and enhance security practices, creating a more dynamic and responsive security framework.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to address the evolving challenges faced by physical security in a rapidly changing world. By applying exercise principles, we can develop innovative security measures that are adaptable, proactive, and holistic. This represents a groundbreaking approach that could redefine best practices in physical security.
