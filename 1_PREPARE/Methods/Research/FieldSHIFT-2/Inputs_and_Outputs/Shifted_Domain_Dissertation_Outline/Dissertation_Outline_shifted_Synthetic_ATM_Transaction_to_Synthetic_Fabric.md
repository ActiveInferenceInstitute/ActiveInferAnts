# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### ATM Transactions
The history of ATMs dates back to the 1960s, evolving through technological advancements that prioritized user convenience and security. The transition from simple cash dispensers to complex machines capable of multiple transactions has set a precedent for user experience design.

### Fabric Industry and Arts
The fabric industry has undergone significant changes, from artisanal production to mass manufacturing, with a recent resurgence in sustainable practices and ethical production. The importance of preserving traditional techniques while embracing innovation is increasingly recognized.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### ATM Transactions
Current research focuses on enhancing user experience, improving security measures, and integrating mobile technologies into ATM systems. The importance of data management and fraud detection is also emphasized.

### Fabric Industry and Arts
Research in the fabric industry highlights the need for sustainable practices, ethical production, and the integration of technology in design and manufacturing processes. However, there is a gap in applying user experience principles systematically.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of these two domains reveals gaps in the application of user-centric design and data management in the fabric industry. Opportunities exist to develop frameworks that enhance user experiences in fabric selection and streamline production processes through interconnected networks.
