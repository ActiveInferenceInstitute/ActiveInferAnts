# PhD Dissertation Plan: Domain Transposition: Negotiation in the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of negotiation theory and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a transformative framework that redefines the understanding of both fields. By analyzing Blake's artistic expression as a form of negotiation with societal norms and dualities, the research aims to contribute new insights into conflict resolution, creativity, and human experience. The potential impact includes enriching negotiation practices, enhancing literary analysis, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately leading to a deeper appreciation of the complexities of life and art.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines negotiation and literary analysis, focusing on William Blake's works as a rich source for understanding negotiation dynamics. Negotiation is traditionally viewed within the realms of business and conflict resolution, while Blake's poetry and art present a unique exploration of human experience, spirituality, and social critique.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional boundaries between negotiation and literature, offering a novel perspective on how artistic expression can serve as a form of negotiation. By positioning Blake as a negotiator of ideas and values, the study opens new avenues for understanding both negotiation and artistic practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How does Blake’s negotiation with societal norms reflect broader themes of conflict resolution in art?
- What insights can Blake’s approach to dualities provide for contemporary negotiation practices?
- To develop an integrated theoretical model that combines negotiation theory with literary analysis.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation**: Overview of historical negotiation theories, key figures, and methodologies.
- **William Blake**: Exploration of Blake's life, major works, and the socio-political context of his time.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of contemporary negotiation theories, including integrative and distributive approaches.
- Examination of recent scholarship on Blake, focusing on interpretations of his dualities and social critiques.
