# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Principles into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and the life and work of William Blake, revealing how negotiation theory can provide a deeper understanding of Blakeâ€™s dualities and artistic expressions. By systematically transposing negotiation methodologies onto Blake's texts, this research seeks to illuminate the complexities of human interaction, identity, and belief that permeate his work. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine both negotiation and literary analysis, offering new frameworks for interdisciplinary research and educational practices. The anticipated impact extends beyond academia, influencing contemporary discourse on identity, culture, and art.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of negotiation principles into the study of William Blake's work represents a novel approach to understanding the interplay of human interaction, identity, and artistic expression. Negotiation, as a process of dialogue and mutual understanding, parallels the thematic concerns found in Blake's poetry and art, particularly his exploration of dualities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional boundaries between literary studies and negotiation theory, proposing an interdisciplinary framework that enriches both fields. By examining Blake's work through the lens of negotiation, we can uncover new interpretations and insights that have been overlooked in conventional analyses.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be effectively transposed onto the analysis of William Blake's life and work?
2. What insights can be gained from viewing Blake's dualities as negotiations between opposing forces?
3. How does this interdisciplinary approach contribute to our understanding of identity, culture, and artistic expression?
