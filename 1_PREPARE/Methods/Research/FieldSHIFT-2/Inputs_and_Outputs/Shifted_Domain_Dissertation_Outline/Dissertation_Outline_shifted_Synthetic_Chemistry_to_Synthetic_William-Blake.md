# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Chemical Reactions to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between chemical reactions and the life and work of William Blake, proposing a novel framework that uses chemical principles to analyze and interpret Blake's artistic evolution. By establishing parallels between the transformative processes in chemistry and Blake's creative journey, this research seeks to illuminate the dualities present in his work, such as innocence versus experience and imagination versus reason. The significance of this study lies in its potential to foster interdisciplinary dialogue between the sciences and the arts, ultimately enriching both fields and providing new insights into the complexities of human experience.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of chemical principles with literary analysis represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding artistic expression. Chemical reactions, characterized by transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, and energy changes, provide a robust metaphorical framework for examining the evolution of Blake's artistry.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only bridges two traditionally distinct domains but also offers fresh perspectives on Blake's work, which has been historically underappreciated. By applying scientific concepts to literary analysis, the dissertation challenges existing paradigms and proposes a new lens through which to view creativity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can chemical principles be applied to analyze the transformation of Blake's artistic style?
2. In what ways do the dualities in Blake's work reflect a dynamic equilibrium similar to that found in chemical systems?
3. What role does societal change play in the kinetics of Blake's creative output?
4. How does the energy of imagination in Blake's work parallel energy changes in chemical reactions?
