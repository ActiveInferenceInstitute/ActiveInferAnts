# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference into the field of negotiation. By framing negotiation as a dynamic predictive process, this research aims to enhance negotiation strategies, improve outcomes, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The work will provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, empirical research, and practical applications that will significantly impact both negotiation practices and cognitive science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy, which has profound implications for understanding cognitive processes. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a static exchange, can benefit from this dynamic framework, allowing for a deeper understanding of how parties interact and adapt during negotiations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges cognitive science and negotiation, offering novel insights into how predictive modeling and active inference can enhance negotiation strategies. The integration of these domains opens new avenues for research, training, and practical applications, transforming how negotiations are approached across various fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What role does active inference play in real-time negotiation adjustments?
3. How do cultural differences impact predictive models in negotiation?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Free Energy Principle**: Origins in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics; evolution into cognitive science and artificial intelligence.
- **Negotiation**: Development from traditional bargaining theories to contemporary models incorporating psychological and sociocultural factors.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **FEP**: Explored in neuroscience, AI, and cognitive behavior, focusing on perception and decision-making.
- **Negotiation**: Examined through distributive and integrative strategies, with a growing emphasis on psychological and contextual influences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between cognitive theories and negotiation practices.
- Need for empirical research to validate predictive models in negotiation contexts.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Variational Free Energy**: Understanding how systems maintain equilibrium.
- **Active Inference**: Mechanisms of learning and adaptation in response to environmental feedback.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Negotiation as Predictive Process**: Viewing negotiation through the lens of predictive coding and active inference.
- **Cognitive Models of Negotiation**: Development of frameworks that incorporate FEP principles into negotiation dynamics.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model that synthesizes FEP and negotiation strategies, focusing on prediction, adjustment, and feedback loops in negotiation contexts.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the application of FEP in negotiation.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiators across various sectors.
- Experimental simulations of negotiation scenarios to gather real-time data.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of negotiation outcomes based on predictive accuracy.
- Qualitative analysis of negotiation strategies and adjustments.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring confidentiality and informed consent in all research activities, particularly in sensitive negotiation contexts.
