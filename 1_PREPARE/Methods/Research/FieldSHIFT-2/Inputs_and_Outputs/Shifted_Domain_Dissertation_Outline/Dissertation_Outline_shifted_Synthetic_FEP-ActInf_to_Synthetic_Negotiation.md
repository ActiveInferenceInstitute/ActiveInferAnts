# PhD Dissertation Plan: "Negotiation Dynamics through the Lens of the Free Energy Principle"

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and negotiation, proposing a transformative framework for understanding negotiation dynamics as adaptive processes aimed at minimizing variational free energy. By integrating concepts from cognitive science and negotiation theory, this research aims to enhance negotiation outcomes, develop new training methodologies, and inform technological innovations in negotiation practices. The potential impact includes improved conflict resolution strategies, enhanced interpersonal relationships, and the establishment of new interdisciplinary fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems, including biological entities, strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. Negotiation, as a process of dialogue aimed at reaching agreements, can be viewed through this lens, revealing underlying cognitive and strategic mechanisms.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research stands at the forefront of an emerging interdisciplinary field that merges cognitive science with negotiation. By framing negotiation as a dynamic system governed by principles of active inference and generative modeling, we unlock new pathways for understanding and improving negotiation practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance negotiation strategies?
2. In what ways do cognitive biases function as prediction errors in negotiation contexts?
3. How do cultural differences in negotiation styles reflect various strategies for minimizing variational free energy?
