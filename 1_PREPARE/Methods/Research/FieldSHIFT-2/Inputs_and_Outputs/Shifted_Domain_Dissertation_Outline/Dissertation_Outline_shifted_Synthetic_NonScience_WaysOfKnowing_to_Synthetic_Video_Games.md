# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of non-science ways of knowing—such as indigenous knowledge systems, artistic expression, and experiential learning—into the field of game design. By examining the synergies between these two domains, the research aims to develop a framework that enhances player engagement, empathy, and cultural understanding through gaming. This groundbreaking work has the potential to redefine game design practices, promote inclusivity, and foster a deeper connection between players and the narratives they engage with, ultimately transforming the landscape of both education and entertainment.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of non-science ways of knowing and game design represents a novel domain that challenges traditional paradigms. Non-science ways of knowing emphasize holistic, subjective, and experiential forms of understanding, which stand in contrast to empirical scientific methodologies. Game design, on the other hand, is primarily focused on creating engaging experiences through structured gameplay mechanics. This dissertation aims to explore how these two domains can inform and enrich each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for diverse perspectives in game design, particularly in an era where representation and cultural sensitivity are paramount. By integrating non-science ways of knowing, this dissertation seeks to create games that not only entertain but also educate and foster empathy. The novelty lies in the systematic exploration of these intersections, proposing frameworks and methodologies that have not been previously articulated in the literature.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing be effectively integrated into game design?
2. What impact does the incorporation of these perspectives have on player engagement and empathy?
3. What new theoretical frameworks can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
4. What practical applications can be derived from this research for the gaming industry and educational practices?
