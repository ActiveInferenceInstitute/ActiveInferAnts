# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between Chemistry and Logistics, two fields that have historically operated independently. Chemistry focuses on the behavior of matter and its transformations, while Logistics is concerned with the efficient movement and storage of goods. By identifying and leveraging isomorphic relationships between these domains, this research seeks to create a new paradigm that enhances operational efficiencies in logistics through chemical principles.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize logistics practices by applying principles from Chemistry. This interdisciplinary approach is novel, as it challenges traditional paradigms in both fields and opens avenues for innovative solutions to contemporary logistical challenges. The research will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also provide practical applications for industry stakeholders.
