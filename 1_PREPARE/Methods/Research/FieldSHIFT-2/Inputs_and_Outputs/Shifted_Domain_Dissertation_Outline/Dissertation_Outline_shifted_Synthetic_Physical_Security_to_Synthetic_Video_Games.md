# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of physical security principles and game design, termed the Shifted Domain. By transposing core concepts from physical security—such as deterrence, detection, and response—into game mechanics, this research aims to enhance player engagement, promote positive behavior, and create immersive gaming experiences. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize both fields, offering new frameworks for understanding player dynamics and security principles in interactive environments. The outcomes of this research will not only contribute to academic discourse but also provide practical applications for game designers, educators, and security professionals.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of physical security and game design, two fields that have traditionally operated independently. Physical security focuses on protecting assets from threats through various methodologies, while game design centers on creating engaging interactive experiences. This dissertation posits that integrating these domains can yield innovative gameplay mechanics that reflect real-world security principles, fostering a deeper understanding of both fields.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for ethical and responsible design in gaming, particularly in light of rising concerns around player behavior and online interactions. By incorporating physical security principles, game designers can create mechanics that discourage negative behavior and enhance player engagement. This novel approach not only enriches the gaming experience but also provides valuable insights into player psychology and behavior management.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of physical security be effectively integrated into game design to enhance player engagement and promote positive behavior?
2. What new gameplay mechanics can emerge from this integration, and how do they impact player experience?
3. What are the implications of this Shifted Domain for both physical security and game design as independent fields?
