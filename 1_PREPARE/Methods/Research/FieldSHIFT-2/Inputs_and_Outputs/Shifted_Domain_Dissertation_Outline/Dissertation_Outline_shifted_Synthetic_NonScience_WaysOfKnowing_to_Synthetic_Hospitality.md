# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Non-Science Ways of Knowing in Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of non-science ways of knowing and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By integrating holistic, emotional, and cultural dimensions into guest interactions, the research aims to redefine the hospitality experience, moving beyond traditional service paradigms towards a more human-centered approach. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both the hospitality industry and broader societal understanding of emotional intelligence and cultural sensitivity.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has historically focused on empirical measures of service quality, often overlooking the emotional and cultural dimensions that significantly impact guest satisfaction. Non-science ways of knowing, which include intuition, cultural narratives, and holistic perspectives, offer a rich framework for enhancing the guest experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it merges two previously distinct fields—non-science ways of knowing and guest experience—into a cohesive framework that prioritizes emotional engagement and cultural appreciation. This shift has the potential to revolutionize how hospitality is understood and delivered.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of integrating emotional intelligence and cultural narratives into service delivery?
3. How can holistic design principles be applied to create enriching environments for guests?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of non-science ways of knowing: Indigenous knowledge systems, traditional practices.
- Evolution of guest experience in hospitality: From basic service to emotional engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of empirical studies on guest satisfaction.
- Exploration of non-science methodologies in various disciplines.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between emotional intelligence and service quality.
- Insufficient research on the role of cultural narratives in shaping guest experiences.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Emotional Intelligence Theory: Goleman’s framework on emotional competencies.
- Cultural Theory: Geertz’s interpretive approach to culture.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Holistic Guest Experience Model: A framework that integrates emotional, cultural, and environmental dimensions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A model that synthesizes non-science ways of knowing with traditional guest experience metrics to create a comprehensive understanding of service quality.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys measuring guest satisfaction.
- Interviews with hospitality staff and guests.
- Observational studies in hospitality settings.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent from participants.
- Confidentiality of guest and staff data.
