# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Physical Security into Ecosystem Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of physical security principles into the study of ecosystem dynamics, a newly emerged Shifted Domain. By examining the parallels between these two fields, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances ecological monitoring, resource management, and conservation strategies. The potential impact includes advancements in ecological resilience, biodiversity preservation, and the establishment of new interdisciplinary methodologies that could revolutionize both fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between physical security and ecosystem dynamics, where methodologies traditionally applied to safeguard assets are reimagined to enhance ecological health and resilience. This integration reflects a growing recognition of the interconnectedness of human security and environmental sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its pioneering approach to applying security principles to ecological contexts, offering fresh perspectives on biodiversity management and conservation. The novelty lies in the development of an integrated theoretical model that combines surveillance, access control, and risk assessment within ecological frameworks.
