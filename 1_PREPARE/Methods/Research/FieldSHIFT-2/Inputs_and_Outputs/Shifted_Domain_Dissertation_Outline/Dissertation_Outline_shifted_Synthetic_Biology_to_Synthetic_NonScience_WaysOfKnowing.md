# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystems into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating biological ecosystem concepts with non-scientific ways of knowing. By establishing a framework that recognizes the interconnectedness, resilience, and adaptability of both domains, this research aims to create a novel knowledge ecosystem that enhances problem-solving and innovation in addressing complex global issues. The significance of this work lies in its potential to bridge the gap between scientific and non-scientific knowledge, fostering a more inclusive approach to understanding and responding to societal challenges. 

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between biology, particularly the study of ecosystems, and non-science ways of knowing, which include intuitive, experiential, and cultural knowledge systems. This convergence highlights the need to understand how these diverse knowledge systems can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation posits that by viewing knowledge as an ecosystem, we can recognize the value of diverse perspectives and practices in fostering resilience and adaptability within communities. This research is novel in its approach to integrating these two distinct fields, offering a fresh lens through which to examine complex social and environmental issues.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can concepts from biological ecosystems inform and enhance non-scientific ways of knowing?
2. What are the implications of creating knowledge ecosystems for community resilience and adaptability?
3. How can this integrated framework be applied to address contemporary global challenges?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Biology and Ecosystems:** A review of the evolution of ecosystem studies, from early observations of species interactions to contemporary research focusing on biodiversity and ecological networks.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Exploration of the historical undervaluation of non-scientific knowledge in academic discourse and policy-making, including indigenous knowledge systems and cultural practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Overview of current trends in biological research emphasizing ecosystem services, conservation, and climate resilience.
- Examination of contemporary movements advocating for the recognition of non-scientific knowledge, including participatory research and community-based approaches.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of frameworks that effectively integrate scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary research that respects and values diverse ways of knowing.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Ecosystem Theory:** Principles of interdependence, energy flow, and nutrient cycling.
- **Cultural Theory:** Theories of knowledge construction, including constructivism and critical theory.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Knowledge Ecosystem Theory:** A conceptual model that frames knowledge as a dynamic, interconnected network influenced by cultural, experiential, and scientific inputs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model illustrating the interactions between biological and non-scientific knowledge systems, emphasizing resilience, adaptability, and collaborative learning.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the interactions between knowledge systems.

### Data Collection Methods
- Case studies, surveys, and interviews with community members, scientists, and cultural leaders to gather diverse perspectives on knowledge integration.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical analysis for quantitative data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the knowledge ecosystem.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent, respecting cultural practices, and prioritizing the voices of marginalized communities in the research process.
