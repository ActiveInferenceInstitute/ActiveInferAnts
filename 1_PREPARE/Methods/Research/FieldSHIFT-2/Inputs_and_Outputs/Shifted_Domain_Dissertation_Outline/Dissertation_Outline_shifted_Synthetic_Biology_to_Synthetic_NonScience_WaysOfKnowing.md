# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Biology to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of biology and non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework for understanding cultural dynamics through biological principles. By systematically transposing concepts such as interconnectedness, adaptation, and diversity from biology to cultural contexts, this research aims to illuminate the complexities of human experience and knowledge. The potential impact of this work extends to education, community resilience, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering a more holistic understanding of cultural sustainability in the face of global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of biological principles and non-scientific epistemologies. As the world grapples with multifaceted challenges, understanding the interplay between ecological dynamics and cultural practices becomes increasingly vital. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between empirical science and subjective knowledge systems, offering insights into how these domains can inform and enrich one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only redefines the boundaries of biological and cultural studies but also addresses critical issues such as community resilience, identity formation, and sustainability. By integrating these fields, the dissertation introduces novel theoretical constructs and practical applications that can enhance our understanding of human dynamics and promote holistic solutions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can biological concepts be effectively transposed into non-science ways of knowing to enhance understanding of cultural dynamics?
2. What are the implications of this transposition for community resilience and sustainability?
3. How can interdisciplinary approaches foster collaboration between scientists and cultural practitioners?

## Literature Review

- Discussion of emerging opportunities for research that can bridge these domains.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Biological Theories:** Ecosystem theory, resilience theory, and biodiversity theory.
- **Cultural Theories:** Social constructivism, narrative theory, and holistic epistemologies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Development of concepts such as "Cultural Ecosystem" and "Narrative Ecology" to facilitate the transposition of biological principles into cultural contexts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A visual and conceptual model illustrating the interconnectedness of biological and cultural dynamics, emphasizing adaptability, diversity, and resilience.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative and quantitative research design combining empirical observation, case studies, and narrative analysis.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with cultural practitioners and community members.
- Field studies observing cultural practices and their ecological contexts.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data.
- Statistical modeling to explore relationships between cultural diversity and community resilience.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent and respect for cultural practices.
- Addressing potential biases in interpreting non-scientific knowledge systems.
