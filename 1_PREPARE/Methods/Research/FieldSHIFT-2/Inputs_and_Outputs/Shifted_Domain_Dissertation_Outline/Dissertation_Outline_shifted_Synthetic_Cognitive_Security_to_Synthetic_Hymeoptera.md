# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Context of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative fusion of cognitive security principles with the behavioral and ecological study of Hymenoptera, which includes ants, bees, and wasps. By examining the intersection of these two domains, the research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how cognitive security can inform the social and communicative behaviors of these insects. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize both fields, offering new insights into collective intelligence, communication strategies, and adaptive behaviors. The findings could lead to practical applications in cybersecurity, ecological management, and the development of bio-inspired technologies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Cognitive security focuses on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation, while Hymenoptera exhibit complex social behaviors that rely on communication and collective decision-making. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by investigating how cognitive security principles can be applied to the social structures and behaviors of Hymenoptera.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective on the cognitive processes of non-human species, suggesting that principles of cognitive security can enhance our understanding of social insects. By applying cognitive security frameworks to Hymenoptera, we can uncover new dimensions of their behavior and adaptability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be transposed to the social behaviors of Hymenoptera?
2. What implications does this transposition have for our understanding of collective intelligence in these species?
3. How can insights from this research inform real-world applications in cybersecurity and ecological conservation?
