# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Entomology with the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating insights from entomology into the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By examining how the adaptive behaviors of insects can inform our understanding of complex biological systems, this research seeks to establish a novel interdisciplinary framework that enhances predictive modeling, learning, and decision-making processes in both natural and artificial systems. The findings are expected to have significant implications for ecology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and sustainable practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between entomology, the study of insects, and the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework for understanding biological systems' adaptive behaviors. Insects exhibit a remarkable range of adaptive strategies that can provide valuable insights into the principles of active inference, wherein organisms minimize surprise through their interactions with the environment.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a new lens through which to view adaptive systems. By examining the parallels between insect behavior and the principles of active inference, this dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of how complex systems function and adapt in dynamic environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can insect behavior inform predictive models in active inference?
2. What role does metamorphosis play in model updating within adaptive systems?
3. In what ways can social structures in insect colonies provide insights into collective decision-making and resource allocation?
