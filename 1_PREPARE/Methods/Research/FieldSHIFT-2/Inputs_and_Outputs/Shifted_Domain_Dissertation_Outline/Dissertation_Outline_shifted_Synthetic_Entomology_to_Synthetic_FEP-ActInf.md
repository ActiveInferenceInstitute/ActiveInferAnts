# PhD Dissertation Plan: Insect Adaptations and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the intersection of insect biology and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), providing a novel framework for understanding adaptive systems. By examining how insects minimize free energy through their behaviors, metamorphosis, and social structures, this research aims to generate insights applicable to cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and ecological sustainability. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both theoretical understanding and practical applications in diverse fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of entomology and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain stability and predictability. Insects, with their remarkable adaptations and complex social behaviors, provide rich examples for exploring the principles of FEP.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to illuminate the mechanisms of adaptation and decision-making in both biological and artificial systems. By applying insights from insect biology to the FEP, we can develop a more integrated understanding of how organisms navigate their environments and inform the design of intelligent systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How do insect adaptations exemplify the principles of free energy minimization?
2. In what ways can the metamorphic processes of insects inform dynamic model updating in cognitive systems?
3. How do social behaviors in insect colonies illustrate collective active inference and decision-making?
