# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience Concepts from Hospitality to Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and the emerging field of quantum computation. By analyzing the core elements of guest experience—personalization, service quality, technology integration, sustainability, and servicescape—and transposing them into the realm of quantum computation, this research aims to enhance user engagement, improve algorithmic reliability, and promote sustainable practices within quantum computing environments. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine user interaction with quantum technologies, thereby fostering broader acceptance and application across various sectors. This interdisciplinary approach will not only contribute to the academic fields of hospitality and quantum computing but also pave the way for transformative advancements in technology and user experience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long been focused on enhancing guest experiences through tailored services and high-quality interactions. In contrast, quantum computation is a cutting-edge field that relies on complex mathematical principles and technology to solve problems beyond the capabilities of classical computers. The convergence of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to leverage the user-centric approach of hospitality to improve the accessibility and applicability of quantum technologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it introduces a novel framework for understanding and improving user experiences in quantum computation by applying established hospitality concepts. This shift not only enhances user satisfaction but also promotes collaboration, innovation, and sustainability within quantum computing environments. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, merging two traditionally separate fields to create a new paradigm for research and application.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can personalization principles from hospitality enhance user engagement with quantum algorithms?
2. What quality assurance protocols can be implemented in quantum computing to ensure reliable results?
3. In what ways can sustainable practices from hospitality be adopted in quantum computing facilities to minimize environmental impact?
4. How can the physical and operational environments of quantum computing be designed to foster collaboration and creativity?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of guest experience in hospitality has been shaped by changing consumer expectations, technological advancements, and a growing emphasis on sustainability. In parallel, quantum computation has emerged from theoretical physics, evolving through advancements in quantum mechanics and computational theory.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature highlights the importance of user experience in technology adoption, particularly in complex fields such as quantum computing. However, there is limited exploration of how principles from hospitality can inform and improve these experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The existing literature lacks an integrated approach that combines user experience principles from hospitality with the technical demands of quantum computation. This gap presents an opportunity to develop a new framework that enhances user interaction and satisfaction in quantum technologies.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service Quality Models**: SERVQUAL and its dimensions (tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy).
- **User Experience Design Principles**: Usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction theories.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Quantum User Experience (QUX)**: A framework for understanding user interactions with quantum technologies, incorporating elements of personalization and service quality.
- **Sustainable Quantum Practices**: The integration of eco-friendly principles into quantum computing operations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines hospitality service quality dimensions with user experience design principles tailored for quantum computing environments, focusing on personalization, reliability, and sustainability.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative research methods to gather comprehensive data on user experiences in quantum computation.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys**: To assess user satisfaction and engagement with quantum algorithms.
- **Interviews**: Conduct in-depth interviews with quantum researchers and hospitality experts.
- **Case Studies**: Analyze existing quantum computing facilities implementing sustainable practices.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis**: To evaluate survey data and identify correlations between hospitality principles and user satisfaction.
- **Thematic Analysis**: For qualitative data from interviews and case studies, identifying key themes related to user experience.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure informed consent from all participants, maintain confidentiality, and adhere to ethical guidelines for research involving human subjects.
