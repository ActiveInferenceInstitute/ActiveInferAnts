# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalization, service quality, and the emotional connections formed during interactions. Conversely, quantum computation, an innovative field rooted in quantum mechanics, emphasizes efficiency and problem-solving through the unique properties of qubits. This dissertation posits that merging these domains can yield novel insights and practical advancements in quantum computing.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it pioneers the application of user experience principles to quantum computation, an area that has traditionally focused on technical performance rather than user engagement. By drawing parallels between the guest journey and quantum processes, the study proposes a novel framework that enhances the usability and accessibility of quantum technologies, thereby promoting broader adoption.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience in hospitality inform the design and implementation of quantum computing systems?
2. What metrics can be established to evaluate the "service quality" of quantum algorithms?
3. In what ways can user feedback enhance the performance and satisfaction associated with quantum computing applications?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The hospitality industry has evolved from basic service offerings to highly personalized experiences, driven by consumer expectations and technological advancements. In contrast, quantum computation has emerged as a cutting-edge field, focusing on harnessing quantum mechanics for computational advantage.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current literature highlights trends in hospitality, such as sustainability and technology integration, while quantum computation research centers on scalability, error correction, and the development of practical algorithms. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary exploration combining these two fields.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of guest experience and quantum computation presents unique opportunities for research. Key gaps include the absence of user-centric frameworks in quantum computing and the potential for enhancing algorithm design through user feedback.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Theories of service quality, co-creation, and customer engagement from hospitality provide a robust foundation for this research. These theories emphasize the importance of user involvement and satisfaction in service delivery.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation proposes new constructs, such as Quantum User Experience (QUX) and Quantum Service Quality (QSQ), to evaluate and enhance user interactions with quantum systems.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model will illustrate how principles of guest experience can be transposed to quantum computing, emphasizing user engagement, personalization, and service quality metrics.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to explore the integration of guest experience principles into quantum computing.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through user surveys, interviews with quantum computing experts, and case studies of existing quantum applications.

## Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis will be used to evaluate survey data, while thematic analysis will be employed for qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will include informed consent from participants, data privacy, and the responsible use of findings in both academic and industry contexts.
