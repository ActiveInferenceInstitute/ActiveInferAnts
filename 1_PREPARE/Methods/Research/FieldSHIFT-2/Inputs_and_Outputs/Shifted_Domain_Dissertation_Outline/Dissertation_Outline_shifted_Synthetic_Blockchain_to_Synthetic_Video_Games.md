# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Blockchain Technology into Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology into game design, creating a Shifted Domain that merges the principles of decentralized ledger technology with the creative and interactive aspects of gaming. This research will investigate how blockchain can redefine player ownership, enhance transparency, and establish new economic models within the gaming industry. The anticipated impact includes not only advancing academic knowledge but also providing practical frameworks for game developers, fostering innovative educational curricula, and influencing policy discussions around digital asset ownership.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of blockchain technology and game design represents an innovative shift from traditional centralized gaming models to decentralized frameworks that empower players. Blockchain's core principles of decentralization, transparency, and immutability challenge existing paradigms in game ownership, monetization, and community engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it leverages blockchain to address long-standing issues in gaming, such as lack of ownership and transparency. By creating a new paradigm where players can own, trade, and govern in-game assets, this study will contribute novel insights and practical solutions to both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology enhance player ownership and engagement in gaming?
2. What new economic models can emerge from integrating token economies in game design?
3. How can decentralized governance structures reshape community involvement in game development?
4. What are the implications of these changes for the broader gaming industry and its stakeholders?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Originated with Bitcoin in 2009, evolving to support various applications beyond cryptocurrency.
- **Game Design:** Transitioned from simple single-player experiences to complex online ecosystems influenced by technological advancements.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Blockchain:** Current trends include NFTs, decentralized finance, and GameFi.
- **Game Design:** Focuses on user engagement, narrative structures, and monetization strategies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of blockchain into game design presents gaps in understanding the economic impact on player behavior, the effectiveness of decentralized governance, and the technological challenges of implementation.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain Theories:** Decentralization, trustless systems, and consensus mechanisms.
- **Game Design Theories:** Player engagement, narrative immersion, and game mechanics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Empowerment Theory:** Players gain agency through ownership and governance.
- **Tokenomics Theory:** The economic implications of in-game currencies and assets.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines blockchain principles with game design theories to create a framework for understanding player engagement, ownership, and economic interactions in decentralized gaming environments.
