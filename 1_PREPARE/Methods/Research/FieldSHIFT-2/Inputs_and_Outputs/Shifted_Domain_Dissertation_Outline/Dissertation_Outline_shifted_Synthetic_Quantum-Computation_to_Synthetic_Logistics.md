## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating quantum computation principles into the logistics sector. By redefining logistics operations through the lens of quantum mechanics, this research will develop a novel framework that enhances efficiency, resilience, and adaptability in supply chain management. The significance of this research lies in its ability to address critical challenges in logistics, such as cost management, delivery efficiency, and real-time tracking, while also opening new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration between quantum computing and logistics. The anticipated impact on both fields is profound, potentially leading to the emergence of new sub-disciplines and innovative technological applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of quantum computation and logistics represents a pioneering domain that combines cutting-edge computational theories with practical applications in supply chain management. Quantum computation utilizes principles such as superposition and entanglement to process information in ways that classical systems cannot. Conversely, logistics is primarily focused on optimizing the movement and storage of goods and information. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can be synergistically integrated.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to revolutionize logistics operations by applying quantum-inspired methodologies. The novelty lies in the application of quantum concepts—such as logistic qubits, superposition inventory, and entangled logistics networks—to solve persistent challenges in logistics, thereby creating a new paradigm for the industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
