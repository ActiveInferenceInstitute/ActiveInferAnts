# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cuisine into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of culinary arts and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By systematically transposing principles from cuisine into the design and delivery of guest experiences, this research aims to enhance guest satisfaction, foster loyalty, and create unique offerings that stand out in a competitive market. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine service delivery, inspire interdisciplinary collaboration, and contribute to both academic theory and practical applications in hospitality management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and guest satisfaction, while the culinary arts emphasize flavor, technique, and creativity. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates culinary principles into guest experience design, leveraging the strengths of both domains to create a holistic approach to hospitality.
