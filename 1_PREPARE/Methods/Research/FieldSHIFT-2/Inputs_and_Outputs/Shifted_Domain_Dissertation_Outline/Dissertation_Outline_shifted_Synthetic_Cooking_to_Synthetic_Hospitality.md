# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cuisine into Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of culinary arts and guest experience in the hospitality industry, proposing a transformative framework that integrates culinary principles into the design and delivery of guest services. By examining the parallels between cuisine and hospitality, this research aims to enhance guest satisfaction, foster loyalty, and drive innovation in the sector. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also provide practical applications for industry practitioners, ultimately reshaping the landscape of hospitality.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service delivery, while culinary arts have emphasized food preparation and presentation. This dissertation posits that a deeper integration of these fields can create richer, more meaningful guest experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The research taps into the growing demand for personalized and culturally resonant experiences in hospitality, leveraging culinary techniques to enhance service delivery. This novel approach has the potential to redefine guest interactions, making them more engaging and memorable.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary techniques be adapted to enhance service delivery in hospitality?
2. What are the key elements of an "experience flavor profile" that contribute to guest satisfaction?
3. In what ways can cultural narratives be incorporated into guest interactions to foster brand loyalty?
4. What innovative "fusion experiences" can be created by combining culinary arts with hospitality services?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cuisine:** Evolution through trade, colonization, and globalization; emergence of molecular gastronomy.
- **Guest Experience:** Shift from basic service to experiential engagement; rise of personalization and technology.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Culinary Arts:** Focus on sustainability, health trends, and experiential dining.
- **Hospitality:** Emphasis on guest satisfaction metrics, personalization, and technology integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research linking culinary arts with guest experience.
- Opportunities for innovative service delivery models that enhance emotional engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Culinary Arts:** Flavor theory, cultural identity in cuisine, sensory engagement.
- **Hospitality:** Service quality models, guest experience frameworks, emotional engagement theories.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Experience Flavor Profile:** A framework for understanding the components of guest experiences akin to culinary flavor profiles.
- **Service Techniques:** Methods of engaging guests that mimic culinary techniques.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model that synthesizes culinary principles with hospitality service delivery, illustrating how these elements interact to enhance guest experiences.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of culinary arts into guest experience.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with hospitality professionals and guests.
- Case studies of establishments successfully integrating culinary principles into their guest experience.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between culinary-inspired service techniques and guest satisfaction.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and addressing any potential biases in data collection.
