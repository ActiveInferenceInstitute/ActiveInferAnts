# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of cognitive security and chemistry, aiming to establish a new interdisciplinary domain that enhances the integrity of chemical research and addresses misinformation challenges. By integrating cognitive security principles into the chemical sciences, this research seeks to develop methodologies that improve data integrity, public trust, and critical thinking among chemists and the wider public. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal perceptions of chemistry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of cognitive security as a vital field in the digital age has highlighted the need for protecting cognitive processes from manipulation and misinformation. Concurrently, chemistry has faced challenges related to public perception and misinformation regarding chemical safety and efficacy. This dissertation proposes a novel approach that intertwines these two domains, leading to a more resilient and informed chemical community.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it aims to fill critical gaps in both cognitive security and chemistry, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. By applying cognitive security principles to chemistry, the study addresses the urgent need for integrity in scientific research and public communication, thereby transforming both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How do cognitive biases influence the interpretation of chemical data among researchers?
2. What strategies can effectively combat misinformation in the field of chemistry?
3. How can AI technologies be integrated into chemical research to enhance data integrity?
4. What are the implications of cognitive security for public trust in chemical safety?
