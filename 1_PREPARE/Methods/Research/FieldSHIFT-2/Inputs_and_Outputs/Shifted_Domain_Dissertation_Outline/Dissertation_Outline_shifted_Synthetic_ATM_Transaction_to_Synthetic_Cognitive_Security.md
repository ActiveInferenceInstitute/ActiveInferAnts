# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between the well-established field of ATM transactions and the emerging discipline of cognitive security. ATMs have long been recognized for their user-centric designs and robust security protocols, while cognitive security addresses the pressing challenges posed by misinformation and cognitive biases in the digital age.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it seeks to transpose principles from the ATM transaction domain into cognitive security, creating an integrated framework that can enhance user engagement and trust in information verification processes. The novelty lies in applying transaction design principles to cognitive security, thus providing a structured approach to combat misinformation.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can ATM transaction principles be effectively transposed into cognitive security frameworks?
2. What impact does user-centric design have on the adoption of cognitive security practices?
3. How can structured information flows improve the verification processes in cognitive security?
