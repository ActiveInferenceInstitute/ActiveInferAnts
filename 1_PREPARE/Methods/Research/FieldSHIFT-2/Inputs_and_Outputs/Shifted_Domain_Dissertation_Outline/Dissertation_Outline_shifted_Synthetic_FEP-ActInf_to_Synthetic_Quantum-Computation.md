# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Integration of the Free Energy Principle and Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the emergent field at the intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Quantum Computation. By synthesizing concepts from cognitive science and quantum mechanics, this research proposes novel frameworks and hypotheses that redefine our understanding of information processing in quantum systems.
