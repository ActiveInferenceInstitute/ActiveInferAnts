# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of logistics principles into traditional knowledge systems, creating a new interdisciplinary field termed "Eco-Logistics." The research will investigate how logistical methodologies can enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of traditional ecological practices, thereby fostering community resilience and cultural preservation. By bridging these two distinct domains, the dissertation seeks to generate novel theoretical frameworks, practical applications, and collaborative initiatives that can significantly impact both academic discourse and real-world practices. The potential outcomes of this research include improved resource management strategies, enhanced educational paradigms, and innovative technological solutions that respect and utilize indigenous knowledge.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents the intersection of logistics—a field focused on the efficient movement and management of goods, services, and information—and traditional knowledge, which encompasses the practices and wisdom of indigenous and local communities. As globalization and environmental challenges intensify, there is a pressing need to reevaluate how these two domains can inform and enhance each other.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for several reasons. First, it addresses critical gaps in both logistics and traditional knowledge by proposing a collaborative framework that respects indigenous practices while incorporating modern efficiencies. Second, it highlights the transformative potential of integrating sustainable practices into logistical frameworks, offering a new lens through which to view resource management.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can logistics principles enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of traditional ecological practices?
2. What collaborative frameworks can be developed to facilitate the sharing of traditional knowledge and logistical methodologies?
3. In what ways can technological innovations support the preservation and dissemination of traditional knowledge?
