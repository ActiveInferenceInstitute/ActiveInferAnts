# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Neural Networks

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles from the fabric industry and arts with neural network technologies. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research will develop a novel theoretical framework that redefines neural networks as "textile" structures. The implications of this interdisciplinary approach will be significant, offering new insights into AI interpretability, sustainability, and cultural representation. Through empirical research, theoretical innovation, and practical applications, this work seeks to contribute meaningfully to both fields and pave the way for future explorations in this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry is characterized by craftsmanship, sustainability, cultural expression, and technological innovation. Neural networks, on the other hand, are defined by their information processing capabilities, plasticity, and cognitive functions. The intersection of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to reframe our understanding of neural networks through the lens of textile arts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
