## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of game design and non-science ways of knowing represents a paradigm shift in understanding human interaction and learning. Game design, rooted in creating engaging experiences through structured rules and narratives, contrasts with non-science ways of knowing, which emphasize subjective experiences, cultural beliefs, and intuition. This dissertation seeks to explore how principles from game design can enhance non-scientific practices, creating a new framework for understanding and engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research presents a novel approach to integrating game design principles into non-science contexts, challenging traditional academic paradigms and recognizing the value of diverse knowledge systems. By leveraging the engaging nature of games, this dissertation aims to enhance educational practices, therapeutic techniques, and community engagement strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
