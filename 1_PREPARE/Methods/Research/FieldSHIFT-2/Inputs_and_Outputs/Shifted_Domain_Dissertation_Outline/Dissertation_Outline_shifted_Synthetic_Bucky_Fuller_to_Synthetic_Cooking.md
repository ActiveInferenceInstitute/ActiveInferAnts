# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts to Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s principles with the culinary arts, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines cuisine through sustainability, holistic thinking, and emergent culinary practices. By developing a Culinary Synergetics Model and a “Spaceship Kitchen” philosophy, this research will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interconnectedness of food systems, enhance culinary innovation, and promote sustainable practices. The potential impact of this research extends beyond the kitchen, influencing environmental policy, culinary education, and industry standards.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s visionary concepts and the culinary domain presents an opportunity to reimagine food systems. Fuller’s principles of holistic thinking, sustainability, and ephemeralization can be applied to address contemporary challenges in cuisine, such as food waste, resource management, and cultural inclusivity.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers a new interdisciplinary approach that integrates systems thinking into culinary practices. By applying Fuller's theories to food, it promotes a paradigm shift that encourages sustainable sourcing, innovative cooking techniques, and a deeper understanding of flavor interactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s principles of holistic thinking and sustainability be applied to modern culinary practices?
2. What are the emergent properties of flavor interactions in a Culinary Synergetics Model?
3. How can innovative technologies enhance ephemeralization in cuisine?
