## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of quantum computation and the artistic philosophy of William Blake represents a groundbreaking approach that transcends traditional boundaries. Quantum computation, characterized by principles such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, provides a unique lens through which to analyze and interpret Blake's work, which is rich in dualities and interconnected themes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to revolutionize both fields. It offers a novel perspective on Blake's art, suggesting that his exploration of dualities can be understood through quantum principles. Additionally, it opens up new avenues for artistic expression that leverage the complexities of quantum computation, thus bridging the gap between science and the humanities.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of quantum computation inform our understanding of dualities in Blake's work?
2. In what ways are Blake's themes interconnected, and how does this reflect the concept of entanglement in quantum systems?
3. What new artistic methodologies can emerge from applying quantum principles to creative processes?
