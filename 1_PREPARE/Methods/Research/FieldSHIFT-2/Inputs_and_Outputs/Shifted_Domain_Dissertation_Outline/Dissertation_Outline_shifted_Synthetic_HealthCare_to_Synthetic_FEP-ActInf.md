# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Healthcare through the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating concepts from healthcare with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By examining the intersection of these domains, the research will develop new frameworks for patient engagement, predictive care models, and technology integration. This innovative approach not only promises to enhance patient outcomes but also to redefine healthcare delivery, making it more adaptive and responsive to individual needs. The findings will have significant implications for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and technology developers, paving the way for a more holistic and efficient healthcare system.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between healthcare—a field traditionally focused on patient-centered care and service quality—and the Free Energy Principle, which emphasizes the role of prediction and adaptation in biological systems. This fusion creates a unique opportunity to reimagine healthcare delivery through the lens of cognitive and computational neuroscience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it presents an unprecedented approach to understanding patient experiences and outcomes by applying principles of active inference and free energy minimization. The novelty lies in the application of these theoretical constructs to address practical challenges in healthcare, such as variability in care quality and patient engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of active inference enhance patient engagement and satisfaction in healthcare?
2. In what ways can the Free Energy Principle be applied to improve service quality and healthcare delivery?
3. What technological innovations can facilitate the integration of these principles into everyday healthcare practices?
