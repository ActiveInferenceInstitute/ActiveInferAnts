# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Hymenoptera to Mitochondria

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of two distinct fields: the study of Hymenoptera (social insects such as ants and bees) and mitochondrial biology. The research seeks to transpose concepts from the collective intelligence and social structures of Hymenoptera onto mitochondrial function and dynamics. This transformative approach aims to uncover novel insights into mitochondrial behavior that could lead to breakthroughs in understanding mitochondrial diseases and enhancing cellular energy dynamics. The findings have the potential to impact both biological research and practical applications in medicine and technology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the ecological and social principles observed in Hymenoptera with the biochemical and functional aspects of mitochondria. This interdisciplinary approach allows for the exploration of new analogies and models that can enhance our understanding of cellular processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of mitochondrial function, proposing that mitochondria may exhibit behaviors akin to collective intelligence found in social insects. Such a perspective could revolutionize our understanding of cellular communication, energy production, and disease mechanisms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How do mitochondrial communication mechanisms resemble collective intelligence in social insects?
- What role does mitochondrial architecture play in cellular health and disease?
- Can understanding mitochondrial foraging strategies lead to novel therapeutic approaches for metabolic disorders?
