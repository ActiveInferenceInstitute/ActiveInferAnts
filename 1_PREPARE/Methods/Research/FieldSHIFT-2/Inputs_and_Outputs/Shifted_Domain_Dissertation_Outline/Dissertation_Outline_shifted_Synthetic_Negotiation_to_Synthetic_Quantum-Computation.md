# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles into the realm of quantum computation. By establishing a theoretical framework that treats quantum algorithms as negotiation processes among qubits, this research seeks to enhance computational efficiency, coherence management, and ethical considerations in quantum technology development. The findings will not only contribute to the fields of negotiation and quantum computation but also propose new interdisciplinary pathways for research and application, ultimately advancing our understanding of computation in a socially responsible manner.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fields of negotiation and quantum computation have historically operated in isolation, each with its own principles, methodologies, and applications. Negotiation is grounded in human interaction and conflict resolution, while quantum computation is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and information processing. However, this dissertation posits that the underlying structures of both domains share significant isomorphisms that can be leveraged for innovative advancements.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of negotiation principles into quantum computation represents a pioneering approach that addresses both technical and ethical dimensions of technology development. This research is significant as it not only seeks to optimize quantum algorithms but also emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and cultural awareness in computational practices.
