## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of the Spatial Web—a paradigm that merges physical and digital experiences—and the complexity of biological systems presents a unique opportunity to redefine our understanding of ecosystems. The Spatial Web leverages technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain to create immersive environments that facilitate real-time data interaction. Biology, with its focus on the study of living organisms and their environments, can benefit significantly from these advancements.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel as it proposes a comprehensive framework—the BioSpatial Web—that integrates spatial technologies with biological research methodologies. Such an integration not only enhances ecological data collection and analysis but also provides innovative educational tools. The BioSpatial Web has the potential to revolutionize conservation strategies, improve biodiversity monitoring, and foster public engagement in ecological issues.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can spatial technologies enhance the understanding and management of biological systems?
2. What are the potential applications of the BioSpatial Web in ecological monitoring and conservation?
3. How can immersive technologies transform biology education and public engagement?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Spatial Web
The Spatial Web has evolved from the early concepts of the internet, incorporating advances in AR, VR, IoT, and blockchain. It represents a shift towards more immersive and interactive digital experiences that seamlessly blend with the physical world.

#### Biology
Biology has a rich history of exploration, from early taxonomy to modern genetics and ecology. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of life forms and their environments, providing a foundation for understanding ecological dynamics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

The Spatial Web is being applied in various industries, including gaming, healthcare, and urban planning. In contrast, biology is increasingly utilizing data analytics and modeling to understand complex biological interactions. However, the integration of these two domains remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of frameworks that combine spatial technologies with biological research. This gap presents an opportunity to develop the BioSpatial Web, which can enhance ecological understanding through real-time data visualization and immersive experiences.
