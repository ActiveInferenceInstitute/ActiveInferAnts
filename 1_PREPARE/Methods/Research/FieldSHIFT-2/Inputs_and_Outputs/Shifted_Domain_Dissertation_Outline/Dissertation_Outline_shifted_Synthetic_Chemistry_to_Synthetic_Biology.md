# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemical Reactions to Ecosystems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and ecosystem dynamics, proposing a transformative framework that reinterprets ecosystems through the lens of chemical principles. By establishing a new lexicon and theoretical constructs, this research seeks to enhance our understanding of biodiversity, resilience, and energy flow in ecosystems. The anticipated impact includes advancing ecological theory, informing conservation strategies, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between chemistry and ecology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel approach that integrates principles from chemistry—specifically chemical reactions, catalysis, and thermodynamics—into ecological studies. By framing ecosystems as dynamic systems of reactions, we can analyze species interactions and energy transformations in a structured manner.
