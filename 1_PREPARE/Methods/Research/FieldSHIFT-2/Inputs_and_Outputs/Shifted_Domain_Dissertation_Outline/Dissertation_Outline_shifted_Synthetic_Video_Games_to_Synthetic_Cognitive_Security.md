# PhD Dissertation Plan: Game Design Principles Applied to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of game design and cognitive security, proposing a transformative framework that utilizes game mechanics to enhance public awareness and resilience against misinformation. By applying principles of engagement, feedback, and player agency from game design to cognitive security, this research aims to develop effective educational tools and strategies that empower individuals to navigate the complex landscape of digital information. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industries, policy-making, and societal norms in the fight against misinformation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of game design and cognitive security represents an unprecedented opportunity to address the growing challenges posed by misinformation and cognitive manipulation in the digital age. Game design has evolved into a sophisticated field focused on user engagement, while cognitive security has emerged to protect individuals from deceptive practices. This dissertation investigates how the two domains can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it proposes novel applications of game design principles to cognitive security, an area that has traditionally relied on more conventional educational methods. The novelty lies in the integration of interactive, gamified experiences that can engage users on a deeper emotional and cognitive level, ultimately leading to more effective learning outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into cognitive security education?
2. What are the impacts of gamified learning on user engagement and retention of cognitive security concepts?
3. How can feedback mechanisms from game design enhance the detection and understanding of misinformation?
