# PhD Dissertation Plan: Negotiation in Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of negotiation principles and chemistry, proposing a transformative framework that reinterprets chemical reactions as negotiation processes between reactants. By leveraging negotiation strategies, this research aims to enhance our understanding of chemical mechanisms, optimize reaction conditions, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The potential impact on both fields is significant, offering new insights into molecular interactions and paving the way for novel educational approaches, technological innovations, and practical applications in industry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain of Negotiation in Chemistry represents an unprecedented intersection of two previously distinct fields: negotiation theory and chemistry. This synthesis allows for a fresh perspective on the interactions between molecules, paralleling the dynamics of human negotiation. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of chemical processes, proposing that reactants can be seen as negotiators with distinct needs and strategies. By applying negotiation principles, we can gain deeper insights into reaction mechanisms, enhance collaborative research practices, and develop sustainable chemical processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can negotiation principles be applied to understand and optimize chemical reactions?
- What are the implications of viewing chemical interactions through the lens of negotiation?
- How can this interdisciplinary approach transform education and practice in both fields?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation:** Examines the evolution from primitive conflict resolution to structured negotiation methodologies influenced by psychology and behavioral economics.
- **Chemistry:** Traces the development from alchemical traditions to modern atomic theory and the emergence of sustainable practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Negotiation:** Focuses on collaborative approaches, technology integration, and the importance of emotional intelligence.
- **Chemistry:** Addresses challenges in sustainability, reaction mechanisms, and the complexities of molecular interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Limited exploration of interdisciplinary approaches that integrate negotiation strategies into chemical research.
- Opportunities for innovative educational curricula and practical applications in industry.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Negotiation Theories:** BATNA, integrative vs. distributive negotiation, and cultural awareness.
- **Chemical Theories:** Thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular structure.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Chemical Negotiation Theory:** Conceptualizes chemical reactions as negotiation processes, where reactants engage in interactions to reach a stable product state.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A model that illustrates the parallels between negotiation strategies and chemical reaction mechanisms, emphasizing the role of catalysts as mediators.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analyses of negotiation strategies with quantitative experiments in chemistry.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Qualitative:** Interviews with negotiation experts and chemists, case studies of successful interdisciplinary collaborations.
- **Quantitative:** Laboratory experiments to analyze reaction kinetics under varying conditions.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of experimental data, thematic analysis of qualitative interviews, and comparative case study analysis.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring ethical practices in research involving human subjects and maintaining integrity in data reporting.
