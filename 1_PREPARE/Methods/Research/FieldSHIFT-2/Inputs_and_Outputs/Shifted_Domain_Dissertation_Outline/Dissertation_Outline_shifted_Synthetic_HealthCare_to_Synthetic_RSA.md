# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Patient-Centered Care Principles into RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of merging principles from health care, particularly patient-centered care, with RSA cryptography. By applying methodologies and insights from health care service quality to cryptographic systems, this research will establish a new paradigm emphasizing user-centered design, patient engagement, and service quality. The anticipated impact includes enhancing user satisfaction, reducing errors in cryptographic applications, and fostering greater trust in digital security systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the intersection of health care and cryptography, where the focus on patient experience and service quality in health care can inform the design and implementation of cryptographic systems. This innovative fusion seeks to address existing challenges in RSA cryptography by prioritizing user engagement and satisfaction.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel framework for RSA cryptography that prioritizes the user experience, drawing parallels with the patient-centered care model in health care. By doing so, it aims to improve cryptographic service quality, enhance user trust, and reduce vulnerabilities associated with traditional cryptographic systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of patient-centered care be effectively integrated into RSA cryptography?
