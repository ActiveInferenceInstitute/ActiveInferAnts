# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Negotiation

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of William Blake's artistic and philosophical principles with the field of negotiation, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes imagination, contraries, and spiritual vision. By integrating Blake's insights into negotiation practices, this research aims to develop a novel framework that enhances conflict resolution strategies and promotes deeper relational dynamics. The potential impact of this work is significant, offering new pedagogical approaches, practical applications in various sectors, and a transformative narrative that challenges conventional negotiation paradigms.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a unique intersection between the creative world of William Blake—a seminal figure in English literature and art—and the pragmatic field of negotiation. This domain invites an exploration of how artistic principles can inform and enhance negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional negotiation theories by introducing imaginative and artistic elements, which have been largely overlooked in the field. The novelty lies in the application of Blake's concepts, such as the interplay of imagination and reason, the recognition of contraries, and the emphasis on personal vision, to develop a comprehensive negotiation framework.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of William Blake inform and transform negotiation practices?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of Blake's work into the negotiation context?
- How can a Blakean negotiation model enhance outcomes in various negotiation settings?
