# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into the Context of Buckminster Fuller

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and the architectural philosophies of Buckminster Fuller, proposing a new paradigm termed "neurodesign." By leveraging principles from neuroscience—such as neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and emergent properties—and integrating them with Fuller's holistic design concepts, this research seeks to create adaptive architectural frameworks that respond dynamically to environmental stimuli. The potential impact of this work extends to sustainable urban planning, innovative building design, and interdisciplinary education, promising to revolutionize how we conceive of and interact with our built environments.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of neuroscience, which studies the complex functioning of the brain and nervous system, and the architectural principles espoused by Buckminster Fuller, who championed sustainable design and holistic systems thinking. This intersection opens new avenues for understanding how architectural environments can be designed to adapt and respond to human needs, much like the brain processes information and learns from experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional architectural paradigms by incorporating insights from neuroscience, thus creating a framework where buildings are not merely static structures but dynamic systems capable of learning and adapting. This novel approach has the potential to address pressing global challenges such as sustainability, resource management, and urban resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience inform the design of adaptive and sustainable architectural systems?
2. What frameworks can be developed to integrate neuroplasticity into architectural practices?
3. How can the concepts of tensegrity and synergetics be applied to create resilient urban environments?
