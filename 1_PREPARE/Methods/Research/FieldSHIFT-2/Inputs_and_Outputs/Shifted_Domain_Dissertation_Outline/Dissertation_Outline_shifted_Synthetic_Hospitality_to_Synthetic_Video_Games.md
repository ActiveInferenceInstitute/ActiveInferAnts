# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry with the mechanics of game design. By analyzing the core tenets of both fields, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances player engagement, satisfaction, and community interaction in games. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize game design practices, creating immersive experiences that resonate deeply with players. This research not only fills existing gaps but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry emphasizes the importance of guest experience, focusing on holistic interactions, personalization, and emotional connections. Conversely, game design prioritizes engagement mechanics, narrative integration, and player agency. This dissertation seeks to transpose the principles of guest experience into game design, creating a new paradigm for player interactions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of guest experience principles into game design is a novel approach that has the potential to enhance player satisfaction and loyalty. This research will provide a structured methodology for game designers to create more personalized and engaging experiences, ultimately transforming the gaming landscape.
