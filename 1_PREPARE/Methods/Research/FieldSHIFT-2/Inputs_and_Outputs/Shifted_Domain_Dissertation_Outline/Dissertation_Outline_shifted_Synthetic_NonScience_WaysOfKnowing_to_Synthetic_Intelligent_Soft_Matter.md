# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Intelligent Soft Matter

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of non-science ways of knowing—encompassing subjective experience, cultural beliefs, and holistic perspectives—into the field of intelligent soft matter. By examining the synergies between these two domains, the research aims to develop a new paradigm that enhances material functionality while fostering emotional and cultural resonance. The potential impact includes redefining material design, advancing interdisciplinary collaboration, and addressing pressing global challenges through a more inclusive understanding of knowledge.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between non-science ways of knowing and intelligent soft matter, two previously distinct fields. Non-science ways of knowing prioritize subjective experiences and cultural narratives, while intelligent soft matter focuses on materials that can sense and respond to their environments. This dissertation will investigate how merging these perspectives can lead to transformative advancements in material science.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize material design by incorporating emotional intelligence and cultural context. This approach not only enhances user experience but also promotes sustainability and social responsibility. The novelty of the research stems from the application of non-scientific methodologies in a traditionally empirical field, paving the way for innovative solutions to complex problems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing inform the design and functionality of intelligent soft materials?
2. What are the implications of integrating emotional intelligence and cultural narratives into material science?
3. How can interdisciplinary collaboration enhance the development of intelligent soft matter?
