# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Insect Concepts to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of insect behavioral principles into negotiation strategies, presenting a groundbreaking framework that emphasizes adaptability, specialization, and collaboration. By leveraging the intricate social structures, communication methods, and adaptive strategies observed in insects, this research aims to redefine negotiation practices and enhance outcomes across various contexts. The significance of this work lies in its potential to create novel approaches to conflict resolution, relationship management, and negotiation training, ultimately contributing to both academic discourse and practical application in diverse fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of entomology and negotiation studies represents an unprecedented opportunity to draw parallels between two distinct domains. Insects, with their complex behaviors and social structures, provide a rich source of inspiration for developing adaptive negotiation strategies. This dissertation seeks to explore these connections and translate insect principles into actionable negotiation frameworks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The proposed research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, offering a fresh perspective on negotiation by incorporating insights from biology and ecology. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of insect behaviors into negotiation practices, creating a unique theoretical and practical framework that challenges traditional negotiation paradigms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can insect behaviors inform and enhance negotiation strategies?
- What are the implications of applying metamorphic principles to negotiation processes?
- How do specialized strategies derived from insect adaptations influence negotiation outcomes?
- What role does collaboration, inspired by insect social structures, play in effective negotiation?

## Literature Review
