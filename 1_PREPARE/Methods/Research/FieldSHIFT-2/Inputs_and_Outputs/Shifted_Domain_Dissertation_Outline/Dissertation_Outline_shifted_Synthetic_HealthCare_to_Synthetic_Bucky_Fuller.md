# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Philosophy and Design Principles

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating health care with Buckminster Fuller’s design principles. It aims to develop a comprehensive framework that redefines health care through the lenses of sustainability, collaboration, and holistic stewardship. By examining the intersections between patient-centered care and Fuller's philosophies, this research seeks to contribute significantly to both fields, offering innovative solutions that enhance patient outcomes, optimize resource management, and promote community well-being. The anticipated impact of this research extends beyond academic contributions, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal health paradigms.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of health care and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophies represents a novel approach to addressing contemporary health challenges. Health care, traditionally focused on individual patient outcomes, can benefit from Fuller’s systemic thinking and sustainable design principles, leading to a more integrated and holistic model of care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to redefine health care delivery by incorporating sustainable practices and collaborative frameworks inspired by Fuller’s principles. The novelty lies in the application of design science to health care, creating a new paradigm that prioritizes ecological and community health alongside individual well-being.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Buckminster Fuller’s design principles be integrated into health care practices to enhance patient outcomes and sustainability?
- What are the emergent properties of a synergetic health care model?
- How can technology be leveraged to create Dymaxion health systems that improve efficiency and accessibility?
