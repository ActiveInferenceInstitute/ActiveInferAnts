# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of healthcare and Buckminster Fuller’s philosophical principles, particularly focusing on design science, sustainability, and holistic thinking. It aims to develop a new theoretical framework and practical applications that enhance patient-centered care while addressing global challenges such as resource management and healthcare efficiency. The anticipated impact of this research includes improved patient outcomes, the establishment of new interdisciplinary fields, and a transformative approach to healthcare education and practice.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The healthcare sector is increasingly recognizing the importance of patient engagement, quality service delivery, and sustainable practices. Concurrently, Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy advocates for holistic, systems-based thinking and innovative design solutions to address global challenges. This dissertation proposes a systematic transposition of healthcare practices through Fuller's principles, creating a novel framework for understanding and improving patient care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to bridge two previously distinct fields, offering fresh insights into patient care through the lens of design science and sustainability. By integrating these perspectives, the dissertation aims to redefine healthcare practices, enhance patient experiences, and inspire a new generation of interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s design science principles be applied to enhance patient-centered care in healthcare settings?
2. What synergetic outcomes can emerge from integrating service quality with systems thinking in healthcare?
3. In what ways can technology be utilized as an ephemeralization tool to improve healthcare delivery?

## Conclusion
The transposition of healthcare principles through the lens of Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy offers a revolutionary framework for reimagining patient care. By applying design science, synergetics, and sustainability practices, we can create a healthcare system that not only meets the needs of patients but also addresses global challenges. This approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of all systems, advocating for a holistic, patient-centered model that fosters collaboration, innovation, and sustainability. In doing so, we can transform healthcare into a responsive, adaptive system capable of thriving within the finite resources of our "Spaceship Earth." This dissertation not only enhances our understanding of healthcare but also sets the stage for a new paradigm that inspires future innovations in both fields. 13.889340877532959
