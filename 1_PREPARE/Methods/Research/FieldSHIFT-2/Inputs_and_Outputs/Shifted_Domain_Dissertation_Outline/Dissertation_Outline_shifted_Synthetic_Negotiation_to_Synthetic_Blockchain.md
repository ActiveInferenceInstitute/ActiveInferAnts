# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Concepts into Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles into blockchain technology, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances both fields. By analyzing the core tenets of negotiation and the structural frameworks of blockchain, this research aims to establish a novel theoretical model that addresses the challenges of trust, transparency, and user engagement in decentralized systems. The findings will not only contribute to the academic discourse but also offer practical applications that can revolutionize industries reliant on blockchain technology.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation and blockchain are two distinct fields that, at first glance, may seem unrelated. Negotiation focuses on dialogue and consensus among parties, while blockchain operates as a decentralized ledger technology for secure transactions. However, both domains share commonalities in their reliance on clear communication, ethical considerations, and the need for consensus among multiple stakeholders.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it seeks to bridge the gap between negotiation theory and blockchain technology, creating an interdisciplinary approach that can lead to innovative solutions for current challenges in both fields. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of negotiation concepts into blockchain applications, thereby enhancing user experience and trust in decentralized systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation strategies be effectively integrated into blockchain consensus mechanisms?
2. In what ways can smart contracts be designed to incorporate BATNA principles?
3. How does cultural awareness influence user engagement and satisfaction in blockchain applications?
