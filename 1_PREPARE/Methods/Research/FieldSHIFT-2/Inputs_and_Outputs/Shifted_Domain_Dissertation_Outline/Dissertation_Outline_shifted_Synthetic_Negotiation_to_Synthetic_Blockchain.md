# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Principles to Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of negotiation principles into blockchain technology, creating a Shifted Domain that leverages the strengths of both fields. The research will examine how negotiation frameworks can enhance the design and functionality of blockchain systems, particularly in areas such as smart contracts and consensus mechanisms. By analyzing the underlying isomorphisms between negotiation and blockchain, this study will contribute to the development of new theoretical constructs, methodologies, and practical applications, ultimately impacting both academic discourse and real-world practices. The findings are expected to facilitate more adaptive, transparent, and user-centric blockchain solutions, with significant implications for industry, policy, and society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of negotiation principles and blockchain technology. Negotiation is a critical process for reaching agreements and resolving disputes, while blockchain offers a decentralized and secure framework for transactions. This dissertation investigates the potential synergies between these two domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of negotiation principles into blockchain is groundbreaking, as it challenges traditional views of both fields. This research will explore how negotiation can inform blockchain governance, design of smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms, leading to innovative solutions that address current limitations in blockchain technology.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles enhance the design and functionality of blockchain systems?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of negotiation and blockchain?
3. How can the principles of negotiation be operationalized within blockchain frameworks to improve user experience and governance?
