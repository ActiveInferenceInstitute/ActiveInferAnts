# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Ecosystem Concepts into Culinary Frameworks

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of ecological principles and culinary practices, creating a new interdisciplinary domain that leverages the interconnectedness of ecosystems to enhance culinary innovation, sustainability, and health. By examining the parallels between ecosystem dynamics and culinary frameworks, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive Culinary Ecosystem Theory. The findings will have significant implications for culinary education, industry practices, and public health, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sustainable food culture.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two previously distinct fields: ecology and culinary arts. While ecology focuses on the interdependent relationships within ecosystems, culinary arts emphasize the sensory experiences and cultural significance of food. This dissertation will investigate how ecological concepts can inform and transform culinary practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it introduces a novel paradigm—Culinary Ecosystem Theory—that views cuisines as dynamic systems influenced by ecological principles. By applying systems thinking to culinary practices, this dissertation will address contemporary challenges in food sustainability, health, and innovation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecological principles enhance our understanding of culinary practices?
2. What are the implications of viewing cuisines as ecosystems for culinary innovation and sustainability?
3. How can the integration of these concepts inform culinary education and industry practices?
