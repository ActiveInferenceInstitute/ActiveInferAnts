# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Biology and Ecosystems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the fabric industry and arts with biology and ecosystems, creating a new interdisciplinary domain termed "Textile Ecology." By investigating the parallels between textile design principles and ecological dynamics, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework for understanding ecosystems as intricate fabrics woven from diverse species and their interactions. The significance of this work lies in its potential to inform sustainable practices, enhance ecosystem resilience, and revolutionize educational approaches in both fields. Through rigorous analysis and empirical research, this dissertation aspires to contribute to the academic discourse on sustainability, biodiversity conservation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long been characterized by creativity, sustainability, and craftsmanship, while biology focuses on the interactions between living organisms and their environments. This dissertation will explore how principles from the fabric industry can enhance our understanding of biological systems, leading to innovative approaches in ecosystem management and sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research offers a novel perspective by integrating artistic and ecological principles, thereby challenging traditional boundaries between the arts and sciences. By viewing ecosystems through the lens of textile design, we can uncover new insights into biodiversity, resource management, and environmental resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of textile design inform our understanding of ecosystem dynamics?
2. In what ways can sustainable practices from the fabric industry be applied to ecological management?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these two domains?
