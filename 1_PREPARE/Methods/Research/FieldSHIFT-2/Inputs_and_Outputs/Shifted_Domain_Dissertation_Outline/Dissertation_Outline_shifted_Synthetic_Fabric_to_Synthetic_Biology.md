# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from the Fabric Industry and Arts to Ecosystems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and ecosystems, proposing a transformative framework that conceptualizes ecosystems as intricate textiles woven from diverse species and cultural narratives. By integrating principles from textile production, sustainability practices, and artistic expression into ecological studies, this research aims to enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, promote biodiversity conservation, and foster cultural stewardship. The potential impact extends to interdisciplinary collaborations, educational innovations, and practical applications in both industries, paving the way for a more sustainable future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry and ecosystems have historically been viewed as distinct fields, yet they share fundamental principles related to production techniques, sustainability, and cultural significance. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, offering novel insights into how methodologies from textile production can inform and enhance our understanding of ecological systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it presents a fresh perspective on ecosystems through the lens of textile design, emphasizing the interconnectedness of species and the importance of cultural narratives in conservation. The novelty lies in the development of the "eco-textile" framework, which reimagines ecosystems as living fabrics, thus opening new avenues for research and practical applications.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of textile production be applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. In what ways can sustainable practices in the fabric industry inform biodiversity conservation strategies?
3. How do cultural narratives influence both textile design and ecosystem management?
