# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neural Networks into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between neural networks and cognitive security, proposing a transformative framework that leverages principles from artificial and biological neural networks to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive threats. The research will provide a comprehensive analysis of how concepts such as interconnectivity, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmission can be transposed into cognitive security, leading to novel methodologies and technologies for protecting cognitive processes. The impact of this research will extend across both fields, offering new insights into cognitive resilience, bias mitigation, and the development of adaptive security measures that evolve alongside emerging threats.

## Introduction
