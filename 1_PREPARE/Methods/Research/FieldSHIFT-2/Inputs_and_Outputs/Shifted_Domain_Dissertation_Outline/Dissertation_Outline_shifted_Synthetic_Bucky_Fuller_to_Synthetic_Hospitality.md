# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating Buckminster Fuller’s innovative concepts into the guest experience within the hospitality industry. By examining the intersections of Fuller’s principles—such as sustainability, systems thinking, and design science—with contemporary hospitality practices, this research aims to develop a new framework for enhancing guest satisfaction while promoting sustainable operations. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis of how these concepts can revolutionize hospitality, offering practical applications and a roadmap for future research.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry faces increasing pressure to adapt to changing consumer expectations, particularly regarding sustainability and personalized experiences. Simultaneously, Buckminster Fuller’s ideas advocate for a holistic approach to design and resource management. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, demonstrating how Fuller's concepts can enhance the guest experience while promoting ecological stewardship.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
