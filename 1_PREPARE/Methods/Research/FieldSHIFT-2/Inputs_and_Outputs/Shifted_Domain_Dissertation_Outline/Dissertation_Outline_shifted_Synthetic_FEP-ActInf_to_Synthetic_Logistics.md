# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating concepts from the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with the field of logistics. By establishing a novel framework that applies predictive modeling, adaptive systems, and real-time data integration, this research will address critical challenges in logistics, such as demand forecasting, supply chain resilience, and operational efficiency. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both the theoretical and practical realms, offering innovative solutions that enhance decision-making processes and operational strategies in logistics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems, including biological organisms, minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. Active Inference extends this idea by emphasizing how organisms act to confirm their predictions and reduce uncertainty. Conversely, logistics focuses on planning, implementing, and controlling the flow of goods and services. This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these domains, examining how principles from cognitive science can inform logistics practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, merging cognitive science with logistics. It offers a novel perspective by framing logistics as an adaptive system that can leverage predictive models and active inference to enhance operational efficiency. This innovative approach not only fills existing gaps in logistics literature but also opens new avenues for research and application.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can concepts from the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be effectively transposed into logistics?
2. What are the implications of applying predictive modeling and active inference in logistics decision-making processes?
3. How can the concept of variational free energy be utilized to assess and improve supply chain resilience?
