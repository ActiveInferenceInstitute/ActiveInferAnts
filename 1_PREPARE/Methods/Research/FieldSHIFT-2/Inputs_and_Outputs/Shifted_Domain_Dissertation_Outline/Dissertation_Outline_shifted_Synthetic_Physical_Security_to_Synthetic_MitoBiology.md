# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security Concepts to Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of physical security principles and mitochondrial biology, termed "Mitochondrial Security." By transposing concepts from physical security—such as surveillance, access control, and layered defense—into the study of mitochondrial function, this research aims to develop novel frameworks for understanding mitochondrial health and its implications for cellular resilience and disease prevention. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both fields, offering a holistic approach to mitochondrial research that integrates technological advancements and interdisciplinary methodologies.
