# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Entomology into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between entomology—the study of insects—and the life and works of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art. By examining the thematic parallels between insect life cycles and Blake's explorations of transformation, social structures, and interconnectedness, this research seeks to create a new interdisciplinary framework that enriches both fields. The findings will not only enhance the understanding of Blake’s oeuvre but also provide insights into ecological themes, potentially influencing contemporary environmental discourse.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of entomology and Blake studies represents an unprecedented approach to understanding both the natural and cultural worlds. Entomology offers a rich tapestry of biological and ecological insights, while Blake’s works provide a profound commentary on human existence and societal structures. This dissertation will examine how these domains intersect, revealing deeper meanings and novel interpretations.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to transform literary criticism and ecological studies. By applying entomological concepts to Blake's themes, the dissertation will highlight the relevance of ecological perspectives in literary analysis, fostering a deeper appreciation for both disciplines.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the life cycles and behaviors of insects inform our understanding of transformation in Blake's poetry and art?
2. In what ways do the social structures of insect societies reflect or critique human societal norms in Blake’s work?
3. What new theoretical frameworks can be developed from the integration of entomology and Blake studies?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the development of entomology as a scientific discipline.
- Examination of William Blake's life, artistic influences, and the historical context of his work.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review contemporary research in entomology, focusing on ecological roles, behavior, and symbolism.
- Analyze current interpretations of Blake’s works, including themes of duality, transformation, and social critique.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identify the lack of interdisciplinary research combining entomology with literary studies.
- Highlight the potential for new insights into Blake's work through the lens of ecological and entomological concepts.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Ecological theories related to insect behavior and adaptation.
- Literary theories relevant to Blake’s work, including Romanticism, symbolism, and psychoanalysis.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Concept of "Insectual Metamorphosis" as a metaphor for spiritual transformation.
- "Societal Entomology" as a framework for analyzing human social dynamics through insect behavior.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of an interdisciplinary model that combines ecological insights with literary analysis, facilitating a holistic understanding of Blake's themes.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative research design employing comparative analysis and thematic exploration.

### Data Collection Methods
- Textual analysis of Blake’s poetry and visual art.
- Field studies observing insect behaviors and life cycles.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic coding of Blake’s works to identify parallels with entomological concepts.
- Comparative studies linking insect social structures with human societal themes in Blake’s writings.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring ethical treatment of living organisms during field studies.
- Addressing potential biases in literary interpretation.
