# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Neuroscience into Negotiation Strategies

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and negotiation, creating a transformative framework that enhances negotiation strategies through neural principles. By establishing isomorphisms between neural processes and negotiation dynamics, the research will provide a comprehensive understanding of how cognitive and emotional factors influence negotiation outcomes. The potential impact of this work extends to improving negotiation practices across various sectors, including business, diplomacy, and conflict resolution, ultimately fostering more effective and empathetic negotiators.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of neuroscience and negotiation represents a novel approach to understanding and improving negotiation outcomes. Neuroscience offers insights into cognitive and emotional processes that underpin human behavior, while negotiation focuses on the dynamics of dialogue and agreement. This dissertation seeks to bridge these fields, applying neural principles to enhance negotiation strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, providing a fresh perspective on negotiation that incorporates scientific insights into human behavior. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of neural concepts into negotiation frameworks, creating new methodologies and strategies that can lead to better negotiation outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles from neuroscience be integrated into negotiation practices?
- What is the impact of adaptive negotiation strategies on outcomes?
- How does emotional intelligence influence negotiation effectiveness?
- What are the implications of this integration for training and technology in negotiation?
