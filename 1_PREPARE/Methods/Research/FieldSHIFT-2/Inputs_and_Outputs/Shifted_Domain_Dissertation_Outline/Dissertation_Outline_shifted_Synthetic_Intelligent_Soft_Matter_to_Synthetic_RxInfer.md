# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Intelligent Soft Matter in Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference (RxInfer.jl)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Intelligent Soft Matter (ISM) and probabilistic programming through the lens of the RxInfer.jl package. By integrating the adaptive, resilient characteristics of ISM with the dynamic capabilities of Bayesian inference, this research seeks to redefine probabilistic modeling, enabling systems that can autonomously adapt to changing environments. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, robotics, and environmental science, providing robust solutions to complex, real-world challenges.
