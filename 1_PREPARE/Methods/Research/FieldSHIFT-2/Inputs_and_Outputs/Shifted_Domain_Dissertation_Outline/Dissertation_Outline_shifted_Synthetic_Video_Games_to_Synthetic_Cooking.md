## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel synthesis of game design and cuisine, two fields that, while distinct, share underlying principles of engagement, creativity, and iterative development. Game design focuses on creating immersive experiences through mechanics and narratives, while cuisine emphasizes cultural expression and sensory experiences through food.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes a new framework that not only enhances culinary education and practice but also redefines how we understand and engage with food. By applying game design principles, this dissertation aims to foster innovation in culinary practices, making them more interactive and engaging.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into culinary education and practice?
2. What are the potential benefits of gamifying culinary experiences for both chefs and consumers?
3. In what ways can narrative structures from game design enhance the storytelling aspect of cuisine?
