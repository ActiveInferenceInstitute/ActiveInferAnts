# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference within the field of astronomy. By integrating concepts from cognitive science and neuroscience with astronomical research, this work seeks to formulate a new theoretical framework that enhances predictive modeling, observational strategies, and our understanding of cosmic phenomena. The potential impact of this research is vast, offering new insights into dark matter, dark energy, and the adaptive behaviors of celestial bodies. This interdisciplinary approach not only revolutionizes astronomical methodologies but also fosters a deeper understanding of the universe, paving the way for future research and technological advancements.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy through predictive coding and active inference. In contrast, astronomy traditionally relies on observational data to understand celestial phenomena. This dissertation proposes a systematic transposition of FEP principles to astronomy, creating a novel interdisciplinary domain that leverages predictive modeling and adaptive strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, fostering a new paradigm in astronomical research. By applying FEP and active inference, we can enhance our understanding of complex cosmic systems, improve observational techniques, and develop robust predictive models, ultimately leading to groundbreaking discoveries in the field.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and active inference be applied to improve predictive modeling in astronomy?
2. What novel insights can be gained regarding dark matter and dark energy through the lens of variational free energy?
3. How can observational strategies be optimized using active inference to minimize prediction errors in astronomical data collection?
