# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Ecosystem Concepts to Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of ecosystem principles with blockchain technology, creating a novel framework termed "Blockchain Ecosystem Theory." By examining the interconnectedness, feedback loops, and resilience mechanisms inherent in both ecosystems and blockchain networks, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ecological concepts can enhance blockchain design, functionality, and sustainability. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and paving the way for new technological innovations that prioritize ecological health and resilience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an interdisciplinary convergence of ecological concepts and blockchain technology, two fields that have traditionally operated independently. Ecosystems emphasize interconnectedness, resilience, and dynamic interactions, while blockchain provides a decentralized framework for secure transactions. This dissertation will explore how principles from ecology can inform and enhance blockchain development, leading to more robust and sustainable systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the pressing challenges faced by blockchain, such as scalability, energy consumption, and security, through the lens of ecological principles. By introducing the concept of "Blockchain Biodiversity" and examining the role of keystone nodes, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm that not only improves blockchain technology but also contributes to a more sustainable digital future.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can ecosystem principles be transposed to enhance blockchain technology?
- What are the implications of blockchain biodiversity on network resilience?
- How do feedback loops in blockchain transactions influence network health?
- What novel theoretical constructs can emerge from this interdisciplinary integration?
