# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystem Concepts into Negotiation Frameworks

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of biological ecosystem concepts with negotiation frameworks, proposing a transformative approach to understanding and enhancing negotiation processes. By drawing parallels between the interdependence, energy flow, biodiversity, and resilience found in ecosystems, this research aims to develop a comprehensive negotiation ecosystem model. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation strategies, improve conflict resolution outcomes, and foster collaborative approaches in various contexts. The findings may have far-reaching implications across disciplines, contributing to the development of new negotiation theories, practices, and educational curricula.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of biology and negotiation represents a novel domain, where principles of ecological interdependence and resilience can inform and enhance negotiation practices. Understanding the dynamics of negotiation through an ecological lens opens new avenues for research and practical applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on negotiation processes. By applying ecological concepts, it challenges conventional negotiation paradigms and proposes innovative strategies that prioritize collaboration and adaptability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can biological ecosystem concepts be effectively transposed into negotiation frameworks?
2. What are the implications of viewing negotiation as an ecosystem for enhancing negotiation outcomes?
3. How can the proposed negotiation ecosystem model inform negotiation training and practice?
