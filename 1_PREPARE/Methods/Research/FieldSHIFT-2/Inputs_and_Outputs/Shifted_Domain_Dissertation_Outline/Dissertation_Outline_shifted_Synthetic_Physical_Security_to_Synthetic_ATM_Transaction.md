# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Physical Security Principles into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating physical security principles into the domain of ATM transactions. By analyzing the isomorphisms between physical security measures and ATM operational frameworks, the research seeks to enhance the security, user experience, and overall functionality of ATMs. The findings promise to yield significant contributions to both fields, offering novel insights into fraud prevention, user engagement, and the design of secure banking environments.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between Physical Security (Domain A) and ATM Transactions (Domain B). Physical security encompasses mechanisms to safeguard assets, personnel, and buildings, while ATM transactions involve self-service banking operations that are increasingly vulnerable to fraud and user experience challenges. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of physical security principles into ATM operations presents a novel approach to addressing contemporary challenges in the banking sector. This research not only fills existing gaps in both domains but also proposes a redefined understanding of ATMs as secure, multifunctional banking hubs.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can physical security principles be effectively transposed to enhance ATM security and user experience?
- What are the potential impacts of integrating advanced security measures on ATM fraud rates and user trust?
- What interdisciplinary frameworks can be developed to support the implementation of these integrated security measures?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Physical Security:** Evolution from basic security measures to integrated systems involving technology and human factors.
- **ATM Transactions:** Historical development from cash dispensers to multifunctional banking machines, incorporating advanced technologies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Physical Security:** Emphasis on holistic approaches, technology integration, and human behavior considerations.
- **ATM Transactions:** Focus on convenience, security challenges, and user experience enhancements.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There is limited research on the application of physical security principles in ATM transactions. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap, creating opportunities for interdisciplinary innovation.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Risk Assessment Theory:** Used in both physical security and ATM transaction security to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED):** Principles applicable to both domains to enhance safety and deter criminal activities.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Integrated Security Model:** A framework that merges physical security strategies with ATM operational procedures to enhance overall security.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A comprehensive model that incorporates access control, surveillance, and environmental design tailored for ATM transactions.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research to assess the effectiveness of integrated security measures.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with users and banking professionals.
- Longitudinal studies comparing fraud rates before and after implementing new security measures.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of fraud incident data.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and surveys.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring user privacy and data security in all research activities, with informed consent obtained from participants.
