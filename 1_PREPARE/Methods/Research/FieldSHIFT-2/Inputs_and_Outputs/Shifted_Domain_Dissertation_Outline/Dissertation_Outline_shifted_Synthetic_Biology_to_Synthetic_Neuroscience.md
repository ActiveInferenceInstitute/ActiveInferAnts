# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Biology to Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of biology and neuroscience, termed the "Neuroecological Paradigm." By transposing key biological concepts—such as ecosystems, biodiversity, and population dynamics—onto the study of neural networks, this research aims to reveal transformative insights into brain function, adaptability, and resilience. The significance of this work lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of neural processes and inform new therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders. This dissertation will establish a comprehensive framework for investigating these parallels, offering a roadmap for future research and interdisciplinary collaboration.
