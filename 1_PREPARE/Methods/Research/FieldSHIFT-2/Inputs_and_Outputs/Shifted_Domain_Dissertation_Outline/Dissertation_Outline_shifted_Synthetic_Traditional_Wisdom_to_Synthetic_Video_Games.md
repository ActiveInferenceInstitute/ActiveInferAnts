# PhD Dissertation Plan: Traditional Knowledge in Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative integration of Traditional Knowledge (TK) into the field of Game Design, creating a Shifted Domain that offers unprecedented opportunities for cultural preservation, ecological sustainability, and community engagement. By examining the intersections of these two fields, this research seeks to develop new theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical applications that enhance player experiences while promoting understanding and appreciation of indigenous cultures and sustainable practices. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, educational approaches, and policy-making.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Game Design represents a significant shift in how we understand and utilize cultural narratives and ecological practices within interactive media. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, while Game Design focuses on creating engaging and immersive player experiences. This dissertation will explore how these domains can inform and enrich one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both fields. By integrating TK into game design, we can create narratives that foster empathy and cultural understanding while promoting sustainable practices. This novel approach challenges existing paradigms in game design and offers a framework for responsible cultural representation and environmental stewardship.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Knowledge inform the narrative and mechanics of game design?
2. What are the implications of integrating TK into game design for player engagement and cultural awareness?
3. How can game design serve as a tool for the preservation and revitalization of Traditional Knowledge?
