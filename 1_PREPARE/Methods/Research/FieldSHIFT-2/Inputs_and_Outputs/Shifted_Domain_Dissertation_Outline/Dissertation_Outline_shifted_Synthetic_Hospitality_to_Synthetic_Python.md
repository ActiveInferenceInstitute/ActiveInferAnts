# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience in Hospitality to Python Programming Language

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of guest experience in hospitality and the Python programming language, proposing a transformative framework that enhances developer interaction and satisfaction. By integrating principles of personalization, service quality, and technology from the hospitality sector into Python programming environments, this research aims to revolutionize software development practices. The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve coding experiences, increase productivity, and foster collaborative development, thereby making substantial contributions to both the fields of hospitality and software engineering.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on creating memorable interactions through personalization, quality service, and technology integration. Concurrently, the programming landscape, particularly with Python, has evolved to emphasize usability and versatility. This dissertation seeks to transpose the core principles of guest experience into the programming domain, specifically within Python's development environments.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it identifies and leverages the synergies between two seemingly disparate fields, proposing a novel framework that enhances user experience in programming. The novelty lies in the application of hospitality principles to programming, which has not been extensively explored, thereby opening new avenues for research and practice.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience enhance the usability and satisfaction of Python programming environments?
2. What frameworks can be developed to assess code quality akin to service quality in hospitality?
3. How can AI and personalization be integrated into the coding process to improve developer productivity?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of the hospitality industry from basic service provision to a focus on holistic guest experiences highlights the importance of user-centered design. Similarly, the development of programming languages, particularly Python, has shifted towards enhancing user experience and accessibility.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature in hospitality emphasizes personalization, technology integration, and sustainability. In programming, research focuses on usability, code quality, and developer experience. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary studies that connect these domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The gap lies in the absence of frameworks that integrate hospitality principles into programming. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing methodologies that enhance the coding experience through insights derived from guest experience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service Quality Theory (SERVQUAL):** Measures service quality across dimensions such as reliability, assurance, empathy, and responsiveness.
- **User Experience (UX) Design Principles:** Focus on usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Code Experience Theory:** A framework that parallels guest experience, focusing on the overall interaction a developer has with the coding environment.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines service quality metrics with user experience principles to assess and enhance the coding environment in Python.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies to assess the impact of hospitality principles on Python programming environments.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with developers to gather insights on current experiences and preferences.
- A/B testing to compare traditional vs. personalized IDEs.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between personalized environments and developer satisfaction.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring confidentiality and the right to withdraw from the study at any time.
