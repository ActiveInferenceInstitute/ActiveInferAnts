# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between Physical Security, which focuses on protecting assets and personnel from threats, and the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework that describes how adaptive systems minimize surprise and maintain their integrity. This fusion allows for a deeper understanding of security as a dynamic and predictive process rather than a static set of measures.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it proposes a paradigm shift in how security is conceptualized and implemented. By leveraging the principles of active inference and predictive coding, the study aims to create frameworks that anticipate threats and adapt to changing environments, thus enhancing the effectiveness of security measures. This novel approach has the potential to inform new methodologies, technologies, and practices in both physical security and cognitive science.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to enhance physical security measures?
2. What are the isomorphic relationships between surveillance, access control, and predictive coding?
3. How can generative models be used to improve threat prediction and response in security systems?
4. What are the interdisciplinary implications of integrating cognitive science with physical security practices?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Physical Security
The evolution of physical security has progressed from basic measures such as locks and guards to sophisticated systems integrating technology and methodologies. Historical milestones include the development of surveillance systems, access control methods, and environmental design strategies.

### Free Energy Principle & Active Inference
The Free Energy Principle has its roots in Bayesian inference and predictive coding, evolving into a unifying theory for understanding perception, action, and learning in biological systems. Active inference describes how organisms act to confirm predictions and minimize surprise, providing insights into decision-making processes.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Physical Security
Current trends in physical security emphasize the integration of emerging technologies such as AI and IoT, which enhance monitoring capabilities, response strategies, and predictive analytics.

### Free Energy Principle & Active Inference
Research in FEP and active inference has expanded into various domains, including cognitive science, mental health, and artificial intelligence, but its application to physical security remains underexplored.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of physical security with cognitive science principles presents significant gaps in existing literature. There is a lack of frameworks that combine predictive modeling with traditional security measures, creating an opportunity for innovative research that could redefine security practices.
