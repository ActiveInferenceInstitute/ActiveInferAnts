## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines health care's patient-centered approach with the adaptive capabilities of intelligent soft matter. Health care emphasizes the importance of user experience and responsiveness, while intelligent soft matter focuses on materials that can sense and react to environmental stimuli. This dissertation will investigate how these two fields can synergistically enhance each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of health care principles into intelligent soft matter represents a groundbreaking shift that can lead to the creation of materials that not only fulfill functional requirements but also prioritize user experience and sustainability. This research is novel in its approach to material design, emphasizing the importance of user feedback and environmental adaptability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
