# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of logistics and the artistic and literary contributions of William Blake. By applying logistical principles to Blake's works, we propose a new framework termed "Cultural Logistics," which examines how artistic expressions function as supply chains of cultural ideas. This research will not only enhance our understanding of Blake's contributions but also revolutionize the way we perceive the dynamics of art and its dissemination in contemporary society. The potential impact of this work extends to educational curricula, technological applications, and interdisciplinary collaborations, thereby fostering a deeper appreciation of both logistics and the arts.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of logistics—a field focused on the efficient movement and management of goods—and the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art, presents a unique opportunity for scholarly inquiry. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, highlighting the parallels between logistical processes and the transmission of artistic ideas.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes a novel theoretical framework that integrates principles of logistics with artistic expression. By viewing Blake's work through the lens of logistical efficiency and thematic management, we can uncover new insights into the creative process and its societal implications. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to reshape both fields, offering fresh perspectives and methodologies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistical principles be applied to the analysis of Blake's artistic and literary works?
2. What are the implications of viewing cultural production as a supply chain of ideas?
3. How can this framework enhance audience engagement and understanding of Blake's work?
