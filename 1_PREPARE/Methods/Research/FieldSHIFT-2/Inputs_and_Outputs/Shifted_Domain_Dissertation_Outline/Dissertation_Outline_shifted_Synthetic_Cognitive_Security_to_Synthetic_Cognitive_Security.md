# PhD Dissertation Plan: Cognitive Security to Information Integrity

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of cognitive security and information integrity, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances our understanding and management of data reliability in the digital age. The research will investigate the cognitive biases that influence data validation processes and propose a framework integrating cognitive security principles into information integrity initiatives. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and technological innovation, this study seeks to revolutionize data governance practices and education, ultimately contributing to a more informed and resilient society. The potential impact of this research extends to academia, industry, and policy-making, paving the way for new sub-disciplines and practical applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges cognitive security—focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation and deception—with information integrity, which emphasizes the accuracy and reliability of information. This integration addresses the growing concerns surrounding misinformation, data manipulation, and the cognitive biases that affect data interpretation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it highlights the interplay between cognitive processes and data integrity, providing a fresh perspective on information management. The novelty lies in the proposed integration of cognitive security strategies into information integrity frameworks, creating a comprehensive approach to data reliability that considers both human and technological factors.
