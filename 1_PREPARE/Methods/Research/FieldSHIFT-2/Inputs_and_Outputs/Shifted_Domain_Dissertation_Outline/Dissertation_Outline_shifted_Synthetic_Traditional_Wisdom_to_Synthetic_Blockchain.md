# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Blockchain technology, termed the Shifted Domain. The research aims to investigate how blockchain can enhance the preservation, documentation, and application of traditional knowledge systems while empowering indigenous communities. The significance of this research lies in its potential to create sustainable resource management practices, protect cultural heritage, and promote equitable economic opportunities for indigenous populations. The findings will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications, paving the way for interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge cultural and technological realms.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of Traditional Knowledge, which encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, and Blockchain technology, a decentralized digital ledger system. This fusion offers a unique opportunity to address the challenges faced by traditional knowledge systems in the modern world, such as appropriation, misrepresentation, and loss of cultural heritage.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The research is significant as it seeks to redefine the relationship between technology and culture, proposing that blockchain can serve as a tool for empowerment rather than exploitation. This novel approach emphasizes community control, sustainability, and the preservation of cultural identity, thereby challenging existing paradigms in both fields.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can blockchain technology be utilized to document and preserve Traditional Knowledge?
2. In what ways can the integration of TK into blockchain governance models enhance sustainable resource management?
3. What are the implications of this integration for indigenous communities and broader societal frameworks?
