# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Blockchain Technology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) with Blockchain Technology (BT). By examining the synergies between these two domains, the research seeks to develop innovative frameworks for sustainable resource management, cultural preservation, and community governance. The findings will not only contribute to the academic discourse but also provide practical applications for indigenous communities and policymakers, enhancing social equity and environmental stewardship.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Blockchain Technology represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that leverages the strengths of both fields. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, while Blockchain Technology offers a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for managing information and transactions. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform and enhance each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to create sustainable frameworks that empower indigenous communities, preserve cultural heritage, and promote ecological stewardship. The novelty stems from the application of blockchain principles to traditional practices, enabling a new paradigm of governance and resource management that respects and incorporates indigenous knowledge.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can blockchain technology be utilized to preserve and protect Traditional Knowledge?
- In what ways can the principles of Traditional Knowledge enhance the sustainability of blockchain applications?
