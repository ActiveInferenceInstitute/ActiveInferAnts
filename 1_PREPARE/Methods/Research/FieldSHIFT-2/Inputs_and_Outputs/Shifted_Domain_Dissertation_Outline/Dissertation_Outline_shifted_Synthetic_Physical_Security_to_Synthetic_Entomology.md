# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security Principles to Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of physical security principles and entomology, proposing a transformative framework for pest management that leverages surveillance, environmental design, and integrated strategies. By systematically transposing concepts from physical security into the realm of entomology, this research aims to address critical challenges such as declining insect populations, sustainable pest management, and biodiversity conservation. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic discourse, offering practical applications for agriculture, public health, and environmental policy.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fields of physical security and entomology have traditionally operated in isolation, with distinct methodologies and objectives. Physical security focuses on safeguarding assets and personnel, while entomology centers on the study of insects and their ecological roles. Recent challenges in pest management and declining insect populations necessitate a fresh perspective that synthesizes these domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines established physical security principles with entomological practices. This fusion promises to enhance pest management strategies, promote biodiversity, and foster sustainable agricultural practices. The novelty lies in the application of security methodologies to ecological contexts, paving the way for innovative solutions to pressing environmental issues.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of physical security be effectively transposed to enhance pest management strategies in entomology?
2. What novel methodologies can be developed to monitor and manage insect populations using surveillance technologies?
3. In what ways can environmental design principles improve biodiversity and reduce pest infestations?
