# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of neuroscience and health care, creating a new paradigm that enhances patient outcomes through an interdisciplinary approach. By leveraging insights from neuroscience, such as neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and communication mechanisms, this research seeks to develop adaptive care models that prioritize patient experience and engagement. The potential impact of this work extends beyond theoretical contributions, offering practical applications that can reshape health care practices, inform policy, and foster patient empowerment.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of neuroscience and health care represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding patient behavior, decision-making, and care delivery. Neuroscience provides insights into the functioning of the brain and nervous system, while health care focuses on improving patient outcomes through various interventions. By integrating these fields, we can create a more holistic approach to patient care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in traditional health care models by applying neuroscience principles to enhance patient engagement, adaptability in care plans, and communication strategies. The novelty lies in the development of an integrated framework that redefines patient networks, care flexibility, and support structures, ultimately transforming the patient experience.
