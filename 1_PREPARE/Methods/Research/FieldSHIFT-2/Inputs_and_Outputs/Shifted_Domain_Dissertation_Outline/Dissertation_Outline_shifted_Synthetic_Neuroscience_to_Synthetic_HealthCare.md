# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Neuroscience into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating neuroscience into health care, creating an innovative framework that enhances patient engagement, adaptive care, and overall health outcomes. By synthesizing principles from neuroscience with contemporary health care practices, this research seeks to address existing challenges in the health care system, such as fragmentation, patient disengagement, and health disparities. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both fields, leading to the development of new methodologies, technologies, and care models that prioritize patient-centered approaches.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of neuroscience and health care represents a paradigm shift that leverages insights from brain function to improve health care delivery. Neuroscience offers a deep understanding of neural processes that influence behavior, cognition, and emotional responses, while health care focuses on patient outcomes and care strategies. This intersection presents unique opportunities for innovation in health care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
Integrating neuroscience into health care introduces a novel perspective that emphasizes the importance of understanding the brain's role in health behaviors and treatment responses. This research is significant as it aims to develop a comprehensive model that can be applied across various health care settings, addressing the need for personalized and adaptive care.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience inform and enhance patient engagement strategies in health care?
2. What adaptive care models can be developed based on the concept of synaptic plasticity?
3. How can feedback mechanisms from neuroscience be utilized to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
Neuroscience has evolved from early anatomical studies to a multidisciplinary field that incorporates biology, psychology, and technology. Health care has transitioned from a disease-centered model to a more patient-centered approach, emphasizing holistic care.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current neuroscience research highlights the complexity of brain networks and their influence on behavior. In health care, there is a growing emphasis on integrated care and the importance of patient-centered practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements in both fields, there remains a gap in the integration of neuroscientific insights into health care practices. This presents an opportunity to develop innovative models that improve patient engagement and care delivery.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Neural Network Theory**: Understanding brain function through interconnected networks.
- **Behavioral Psychology**: Examining how behavior is influenced by cognitive processes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Synaptic Engagement**: The active involvement of patients in their care decisions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines neural network theory with adaptive care principles, emphasizing the dynamic relationship between patients and health care providers.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of neuroscience into health care.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with health care providers and patients.
