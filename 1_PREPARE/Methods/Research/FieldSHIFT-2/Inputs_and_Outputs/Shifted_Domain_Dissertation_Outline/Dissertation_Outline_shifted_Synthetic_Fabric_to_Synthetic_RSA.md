# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into RSA Cryptography

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection between the fabric industry and RSA cryptography, proposing a transformative framework that integrates craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural expression into cryptographic practices. By identifying isomorphisms between these two domains, this research aims to generate novel hypotheses that enhance user engagement, promote eco-friendly practices, and redefine the role of identity in digital communications. The findings have the potential to revolutionize the field of cryptography, offering significant implications for both the fabric industry and digital security.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, with its rich traditions and emphasis on craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural narratives, contrasts sharply with the mathematical and technical foundations of RSA cryptography. This dissertation posits that by transposing elements from the fabric industry into the realm of RSA cryptography, we can create a new paradigm that emphasizes the human experience in digital security.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers a novel interdisciplinary approach, merging artistic and technical perspectives. It challenges conventional views of cryptography as purely mathematical, proposing that cultural and artistic elements can enhance security practices. This shift has the potential to foster greater user engagement and trust in digital communications.
