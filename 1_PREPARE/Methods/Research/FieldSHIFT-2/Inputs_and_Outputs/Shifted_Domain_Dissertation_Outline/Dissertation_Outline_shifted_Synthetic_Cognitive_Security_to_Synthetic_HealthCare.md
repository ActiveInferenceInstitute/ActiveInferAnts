# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Cognitive Security to Healthcare

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of cognitive security principles into the healthcare domain, addressing the critical need for enhanced patient education, misinformation management, and cognitive bias mitigation. By investigating the interplay between these two fields, the research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances patient outcomes, fosters informed decision-making, and promotes a resilient healthcare system. The potential impact of this work extends beyond healthcare, offering insights into interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of new paradigms in knowledge creation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of cognitive security and healthcare represents a transformative shift in how we understand and address the complexities of patient care and information integrity. Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation, while healthcare encompasses the multifaceted aspects of patient care and service delivery. This dissertation will delve into the synergies between these domains, highlighting their shared challenges and opportunities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing concern over misinformation in healthcare, particularly in the digital age where patients are bombarded with conflicting information. By applying cognitive security strategies to healthcare, we can enhance patient literacy, improve decision-making, and ultimately lead to better health outcomes. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, creating a new lexicon and framework for understanding health literacy through the lens of cognitive security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can cognitive security principles be effectively integrated into healthcare practices?
- What are the potential impacts of enhanced patient education and misinformation management on health outcomes?
- How can we develop a new theoretical framework that bridges cognitive security and healthcare?
