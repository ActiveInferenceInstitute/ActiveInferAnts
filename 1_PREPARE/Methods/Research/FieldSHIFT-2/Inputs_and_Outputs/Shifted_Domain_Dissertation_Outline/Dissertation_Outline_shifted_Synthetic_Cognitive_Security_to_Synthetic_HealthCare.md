# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Cognitive Security into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of cognitive security and health care, aiming to enhance patient outcomes through the lens of cognitive resilience and misinformation management. By applying principles from cognitive security—focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation—this research seeks to address the pervasive issue of health misinformation that undermines patient decision-making and trust in healthcare systems. The proposed research will generate new theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and practical applications that can revolutionize patient education and health communication strategies, ultimately fostering a more informed and resilient patient population.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of cognitive security and health care stems from the increasing prevalence of misinformation affecting health outcomes. Cognitive security emphasizes safeguarding cognitive processes against manipulation, while health care is focusing on patient-centered approaches. This dissertation aims to bridge these domains, providing a comprehensive analysis of how cognitive security principles can enhance health care practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it introduces cognitive security frameworks into health care, addressing the urgent need for innovative strategies to combat health misinformation. By integrating these two fields, the dissertation will contribute to the development of new educational paradigms, technological solutions, and interdisciplinary collaborations.
