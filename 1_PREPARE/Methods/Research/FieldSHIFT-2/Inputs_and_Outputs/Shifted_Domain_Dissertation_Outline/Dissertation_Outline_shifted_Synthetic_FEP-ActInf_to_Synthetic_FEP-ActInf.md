# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), proposing a novel therapeutic framework that leverages predictive coding and variational free energy concepts to enhance mental health treatment. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize therapeutic practices, offering a scientifically grounded approach to cognitive restructuring and emotional regulation. By articulating a comprehensive theoretical model and empirical research agenda, this dissertation will contribute to the advancement of both psychological theory and clinical practice, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes in mental health care.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through adaptive behaviors. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, on the other hand, focuses on altering dysfunctional thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, creating a new paradigm for understanding and treating mental health disorders.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of FEP into CBT offers a groundbreaking perspective on cognitive and emotional processes. This research is significant as it not only bridges cognitive neuroscience and psychotherapy but also creates a framework for predicting and addressing mental health issues through a scientific lens. The novelty lies in the application of predictive coding and variational free energy principles to therapeutic practices, providing a fresh approach to cognitive restructuring.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle inform and enhance therapeutic techniques in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?
2. What empirical evidence supports the efficacy of a predictive coding model in addressing cognitive distortions?
3. How can the concept of variational free energy be applied to understand and treat mental health disorders?
