# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Applications of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference in Adaptive Systems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore and redefine the applications of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) by integrating insights from both frameworks to foster a deeper understanding of adaptive systems. The research seeks to bridge the gap between biological and social sciences, proposing innovative models that incorporate predictive behaviors and collective dynamics. By addressing existing challenges and gaps in both domains, the dissertation aspires to generate novel hypotheses and practical applications that could significantly impact ecological management, social cohesion, and technological advancements. 

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain homeostasis, while Active Inference extends this concept by suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environments to confirm predictions and minimize surprise. This dissertation will explore how these principles can be applied to social and ecological systems, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes predictive modeling and adaptive behaviors.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of adaptive systems by combining insights from FEP and AI. This novel approach can lead to groundbreaking advancements in ecological management, social dynamics, and artificial intelligence, offering a unified framework for understanding complex interactions across disciplines.
