# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemical Reaction Concepts into the Free Energy Principle Context

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), creating a novel framework for understanding adaptive behaviors in biological systems. By systematically transposing concepts from chemistry into the context of cognitive science, this research seeks to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of adaptation and learning. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize educational approaches, inform artificial intelligence design, and inspire new materials that mimic adaptive behaviors. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis of the theoretical underpinnings, empirical investigations, and practical applications of this Shifted Domain.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of chemical reaction principles, such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics, with the Free Energy Principle, which posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the transformative processes shared between chemical systems and adaptive behaviors in organisms.
