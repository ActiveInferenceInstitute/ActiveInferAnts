# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemistry into the Context of the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the fields of Chemistry and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Active Inference. By establishing a framework that integrates chemical processes with predictive modeling, this research seeks to redefine our understanding of chemical interactions as dynamic, adaptive systems. The transformative potential of this Shifted Domain lies in its ability to provide novel insights into chemical behavior, catalysis, and equilibrium, ultimately leading to advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications in various fields, including materials science, pharmacology, and environmental science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Chemistry, traditionally viewed through a reductionist lens, and the FEP, which emphasizes the adaptive nature of living systems. This integration offers a fresh perspective on chemical reactions, catalysis, and equilibrium, framed as processes that strive to minimize free energy and maximize predictive accuracy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges the conventional paradigms of both Chemistry and cognitive science. By viewing chemical reactions as predictive processes, we can develop a deeper understanding of how systems adapt and evolve, opening up new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can chemical reactions be conceptualized as predictive models within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
- In what ways do catalysts enhance predictive capabilities in chemical systems?
- What implications does the integration of these fields have for our understanding of homeostasis and equilibrium in both chemical and biological systems?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of Chemistry from alchemy to a rigorous scientific discipline has been marked by significant milestones, including the development of atomic theory and thermodynamics. Similarly, the FEP has emerged as a pivotal concept in understanding biological systems, drawing from a rich history of cognitive science and neuroscience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Chemistry currently emphasizes sustainability and interdisciplinary approaches, while the FEP has gained traction in understanding cognition and behavior. However, there remains a lack of integration between these domains, highlighting the need for a comprehensive exploration of their interconnections.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
