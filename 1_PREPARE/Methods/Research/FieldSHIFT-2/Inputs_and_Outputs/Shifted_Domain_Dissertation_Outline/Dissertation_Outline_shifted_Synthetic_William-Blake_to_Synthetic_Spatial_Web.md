# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake’s Life and Work into the Context of the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's life and work with the emerging field of the Spatial Web. By analyzing Blake's visionary experiences, duality, and integration of art and poetry, this research will propose a new framework for enhancing user engagement and experience in the Spatial Web. The significance of this study lies in its potential to transform digital interactions, promote ethical practices, and inspire new artistic collaborations. The overarching goal is to establish a comprehensive understanding of how Blake's philosophies can inform and shape the development of immersive digital environments, ultimately leading to a more enriched and meaningful user experience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift in how users interact with digital content, merging physical and digital experiences through technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This domain shift invites a reevaluation of artistic and literary traditions, particularly the works of visionary artists like William Blake.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between literature, art, and technology. By applying Blake's philosophical concepts to the Spatial Web, the dissertation seeks to create a framework that enhances user engagement, promotes creativity, and addresses ethical considerations in digital environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can William Blake's visionary experiences inform the design and development of immersive experiences in the Spatial Web?
- What are the implications of integrating duality and contraries from Blake's philosophy into interaction design?
- How can collaborative artistic projects inspired by Blake's work be facilitated in the Spatial Web?
- What ethical considerations arise from user empowerment in the Spatial Web, and how can they be addressed?
