# Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes an innovative framework that reimagines negotiation through the lens of culinary principles, creating a Shifted Domain that merges the fields of Cuisine and Negotiation. By exploring the intersections between flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and negotiation strategies, this research aims to provide fresh insights into negotiation practices. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance negotiation outcomes through creativity, adaptability, and cultural understanding. The findings may not only impact negotiation theory and practice but also influence educational curricula and industry training programs, fostering a more collaborative approach to conflict resolution.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain merges two previously distinct fields: Cuisine and Negotiation. Cuisine encompasses the art and science of food preparation, emphasizing creativity and cultural awareness, while Negotiation focuses on the strategies and tactics employed to reach agreements. This dissertation seeks to explore the synergies between these domains, proposing that culinary principles can inform and enhance negotiation practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which allows for a fresh perspective on negotiation. By applying culinary concepts, this study aims to address the limitations of traditional negotiation paradigms that often emphasize win-lose scenarios. This research highlights the importance of understanding interests and needs, preparation, and relationship building, offering a transformative approach to negotiation.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can culinary principles inform negotiation strategies and practices?
2. What is the relationship between flavor profiles and negotiation interests?
3. How can the integration of culinary techniques enhance negotiation outcomes?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the Shifted Domain?
