# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from the Fabric Industry and Arts to Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with mitochondrial biology, proposing a transformative framework that reimagines mitochondrial health through principles of creativity, sustainability, and cultural significance. By identifying isomorphisms between these domains, the research aims to generate novel hypotheses and theories that enhance our understanding of mitochondrial function and promote public awareness of mitochondrial diseases. This interdisciplinary approach not only expands the theoretical landscape of both fields but also proposes practical applications that can have significant societal impacts.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry and arts have long been recognized for their cultural, economic, and environmental significance. Concurrently, mitochondrial biology serves as a cornerstone of cellular function and health. This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, leveraging their unique strengths to foster a deeper understanding of mitochondrial health and its implications for human well-being.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on mitochondrial biology through the lens of fabric design and sustainability. The novelty lies in the application of artistic and sustainable principles to biological systems, paving the way for innovative research methodologies and public health initiatives.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from the fabric industry inform our understanding of mitochondrial architecture and function?
2. In what ways can sustainable practices in textiles provide insights into mitochondrial health maintenance?
3. How can cultural narratives surrounding textiles enhance public engagement with mitochondrial health issues?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of these domains?
