# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Game Design into Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of game design and neuroscience, proposing a framework that leverages the principles of game mechanics to enhance understanding of neural processes. By investigating the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research seeks to contribute novel insights into cognitive engagement, neuroplasticity, and therapeutic applications. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform both fields, offering new methodologies for cognitive enhancement and educational practices, as well as informing the design of therapeutic interventions.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of digital gaming as a cultural and educational phenomenon has led to a reevaluation of its potential impact on cognitive processes. Concurrently, advancements in neuroscience have provided deeper insights into brain function and behavior. This dissertation posits that the principles of game design can be transposed into neuroscience to create a new paradigm for understanding cognitive engagement and neural adaptation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a novel lens through which to examine cognitive processes. The integration of game design principles into neuroscience not only enhances our understanding of neural mechanisms but also provides practical applications for education and therapy.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game mechanics inform our understanding of neural circuits and cognitive processes?
2. What are the implications of player engagement strategies for enhancing neuroplasticity?
3. How can this transposed framework be utilized to develop therapeutic interventions for cognitive disorders?
