# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Integration of William Blake's Life and Work into Intelligent Soft Matter

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the transformative potential of integrating the philosophical and artistic principles of William Blake with the emerging field of intelligent soft matter. By reimagining materials as entities that embody narrative and emotional qualities, this research aims to bridge the gap between art and science, fostering innovative applications that resonate with human experiences. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine our understanding of materials, challenge traditional paradigms, and inspire new interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately enhancing societal well-being and environmental sustainability.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of William Blake's artistic and philosophical insights with the scientific advancements in intelligent soft matter. Blake's exploration of dualities, imagination, and interconnectedness provides a rich conceptual foundation for rethinking material design and functionality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, merging the realms of literature, art, and material science. By applying Blakean principles to intelligent soft matter, this dissertation aims to create materials that not only respond to environmental stimuli but also engage users on an emotional and narrative level, thereby enhancing human experience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of duality, imagination, and interconnectedness from Blake's work inform the design of intelligent soft materials?
2. In what ways can intelligent materials be developed to express emotional states and narratives?
3. What are the implications of this integration for the fields of material science, art, and psychology?
