# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles into physical security practices, proposing a novel framework termed "Cognitive-Physical Security." This interdisciplinary approach seeks to enhance resilience against both cognitive and physical threats by addressing the psychological dimensions of security. The research aims to fill critical gaps in current security paradigms, offering innovative strategies for training security personnel, developing community awareness programs, and leveraging technology for behavioral analysis. The implications of this work extend beyond traditional security measures, promising significant advancements in public safety, policy formulation, and societal resilience.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

Cognitive security focuses on protecting individuals from cognitive manipulation and misinformation, while physical security is concerned with safeguarding tangible assets and personnel from physical threats. The fusion of these domains represents a paradigm shift in how security is conceptualized, emphasizing the interplay between cognitive vulnerabilities and physical security measures.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of cognitive security into physical security practices is groundbreaking, as it addresses the often-overlooked psychological factors that influence security effectiveness. This research aims to create a cohesive framework that enhances the understanding of security threats, leading to more effective prevention and response strategies.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can cognitive security principles be effectively integrated into physical security practices?
2. What are the psychological vulnerabilities that impact physical security?
3. What training methodologies can enhance the cognitive resilience of security personnel and communities?
