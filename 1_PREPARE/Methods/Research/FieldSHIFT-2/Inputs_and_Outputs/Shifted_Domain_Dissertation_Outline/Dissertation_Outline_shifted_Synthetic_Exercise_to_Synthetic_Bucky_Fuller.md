# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying Exercise Principles to Buckminster Fuller's Philosophy and Innovations

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating exercise principles with the holistic design philosophy of Buckminster Fuller. By examining the synergies between physical health and sustainable design, the research will develop a new framework for urban planning that promotes community well-being and environmental sustainability. The findings are expected to have significant implications for public health, architecture, and policy-making, ultimately contributing to the creation of healthier, more resilient communities.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the fields of exercise science and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy. Exercise science focuses on the benefits of physical activity for health and wellness, while Fuller’s work emphasizes comprehensive design and sustainability. This intersection provides a unique opportunity to address contemporary challenges in urban planning and public health.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes a novel framework that prioritizes human health in design practices. It challenges traditional approaches to urban planning by integrating exercise principles, thereby fostering environments that encourage physical activity and promote overall well-being. The novelty lies in the application of exercise science to architectural and environmental design, creating a new paradigm for sustainable living.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can exercise principles be effectively integrated into urban design to improve community health?
2. What are the synergies between exercise science and Fuller's design philosophy that can inform sustainable practices?
3. In what ways can this integration lead to innovative solutions for contemporary urban challenges?
