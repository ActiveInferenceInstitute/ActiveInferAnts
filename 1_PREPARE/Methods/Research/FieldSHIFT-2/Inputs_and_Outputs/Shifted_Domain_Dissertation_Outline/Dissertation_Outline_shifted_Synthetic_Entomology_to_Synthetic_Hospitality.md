# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Entomology into Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of entomology and guest experience within the hospitality industry. By applying principles from entomology—such as metamorphosis, communication systems, social structures, and adaptation mechanisms—this research seeks to redefine guest experiences, enhance service delivery, and foster team dynamics. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize hospitality practices, offering a novel framework that emphasizes adaptability and emotional engagement. The findings are expected to inform both academic discourse and practical applications within the industry, ultimately leading to increased guest satisfaction and loyalty.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of entomology and guest experience represents a pioneering approach to understanding and enhancing the dynamics of hospitality. Entomology, the study of insects, provides insights into complex biological systems, while guest experience focuses on the emotional and experiential aspects of consumer interactions in hospitality settings.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant not only for its interdisciplinary approach but also for its potential to introduce biological insights into the largely anthropocentric field of hospitality. By leveraging entomological concepts, the dissertation aims to create a transformative framework that enhances guest interactions and operational efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of entomology inform and enhance the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of adopting insect-inspired frameworks for team dynamics and service delivery?
3. How can the understanding of metamorphosis, communication, social structures, and adaptation mechanisms lead to innovative practices in the hospitality industry?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Entomology:** Tracing its evolution from natural history to a scientific discipline, focusing on biodiversity and ecosystem health.
- **Guest Experience:** Examining the shift from basic service provision to a comprehensive focus on emotional engagement and personalization.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Entomology:** Current trends include biotechnology applications and ecological modeling.
- **Guest Experience:** Emphasis on data-driven personalization, technology integration, and service quality.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There is a notable gap in the application of biological insights to enhance guest experiences. This research seeks to fill that gap by exploring isomorphisms between entomological principles and hospitality practices.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Entomology Theories:** Evolutionary biology, ecological interactions, and behavioral ecology.
- **Guest Experience Theories:** Service quality models, emotional engagement frameworks, and customer satisfaction theories.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Metamorphosis Framework:** Viewing the guest journey as a transformative experience.
- **Communication Strategies:** Multi-modal approaches inspired by insect signaling.
- **Social Structures:** Collaborative service delivery models based on insect colony behaviors.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that synthesizes entomological principles with guest experience theories, providing a comprehensive framework for enhancing hospitality practices.

## Methodology
