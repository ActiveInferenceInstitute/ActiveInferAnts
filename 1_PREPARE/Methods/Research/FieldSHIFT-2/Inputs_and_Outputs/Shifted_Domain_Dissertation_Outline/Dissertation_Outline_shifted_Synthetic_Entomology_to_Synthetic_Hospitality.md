# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of entomological principles into the field of hospitality, specifically focusing on enhancing guest experience. By transposing concepts from the study of insects—such as metamorphosis, specialization, social structures, and communication—into hospitality management, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that redefines guest interactions. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize hospitality practices, improve guest satisfaction, and foster sustainable operational models. The anticipated impact extends beyond academic contributions, offering practical applications for industry stakeholders, policy-makers, and educators.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the intersection of entomology and hospitality management. Insects play a crucial role in ecosystems through their unique adaptations, communication methods, and social structures. Meanwhile, the hospitality industry faces challenges in personalization, service quality, and technology integration. This dissertation posits that insights from insect behavior can inform and enhance guest experiences.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, merging biological principles with hospitality practices. It addresses critical gaps in current hospitality paradigms by proposing a framework that leverages biological insights to improve guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The transformative potential of this research lies in its ability to create a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that redefine guest experience.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can insect principles inform the design of guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of applying entomological concepts for service delivery and team dynamics?
3. How can technology be utilized to enhance the metamorphosis of guest experiences?
