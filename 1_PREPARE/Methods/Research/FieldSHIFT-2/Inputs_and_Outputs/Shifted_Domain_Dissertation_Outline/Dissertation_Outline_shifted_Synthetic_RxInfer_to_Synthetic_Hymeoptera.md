# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference from RxInfer.jl to Hymenoptera Studies

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference methodologies from the RxInfer.jl framework into the study of Hymenoptera, specifically focusing on ants, bees, and wasps. By leveraging advanced statistical models and computational techniques, this research seeks to address critical gaps in understanding the complex social behaviors and ecological dynamics of these insects. The outcomes are expected to revolutionize Hymenoptera studies, providing robust models for decision-making, foraging strategies, and social structures, while also contributing to broader ecological research and applications.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between probabilistic programming and ecological studies, specifically focusing on Hymenoptera. RxInfer.jl, a powerful tool for Bayesian inference, provides a framework for modeling uncertainty and complex relationships, which can be applied to the intricate social structures and behaviors of these insects.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a rigorous, data-driven approach to Hymenoptera studies, which have traditionally relied on qualitative observations. By applying probabilistic models, this dissertation aims to uncover the underlying mechanisms of collective intelligence and decision-making in social insects.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can probabilistic graphical models enhance our understanding of foraging strategies in Hymenoptera?
2. What implications does Bayesian inference have for analyzing decision-making processes in ant colonies?
3. How can hierarchical Bayesian models predict changes in social structure under environmental stress?
