## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Intelligent soft matter represents a transformative field where materials can respond to environmental stimuli, integrating functions such as sensing and actuation. William Blake, a pivotal figure in literature and visual arts, explored themes of duality and interconnectedness in his work. This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these domains, leveraging the adaptive nature of intelligent materials to reinterpret Blake's artistic vision.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between material science and literary art, providing fresh perspectives on both fields. The novelty lies in the application of intelligent soft materials to create responsive art and poetry, challenging traditional notions of authorship and engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can intelligent soft materials be utilized to create adaptive artworks that reflect the themes of William Blake's poetry?
2. What new theoretical frameworks emerge from the intersection of intelligent soft matter and Blake's artistic vision?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach inform educational practices and societal perceptions of creativity?
