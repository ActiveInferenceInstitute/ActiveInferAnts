# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Hymenoptera to Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of principles derived from Hymenoptera—specifically ants, bees, and wasps—and their application to modern physical security systems. By transposing concepts such as collective intelligence, adaptive architecture, and community engagement from the study of these insects, this research seeks to develop novel frameworks and methodologies that enhance security operations. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize physical security practices, fostering more adaptive, effective, and community-oriented approaches to safeguarding people and property. This dissertation will contribute to both entomological and security studies, providing a comprehensive roadmap for future interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The study of Hymenoptera has revealed intricate social structures and adaptive behaviors, which can inform various fields, including security. Physical security, traditionally focused on technological and procedural aspects, can benefit from biological insights that emphasize adaptability and community involvement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking in its approach to integrating biological principles into physical security, offering a fresh perspective that challenges existing paradigms. By drawing parallels between the behaviors of Hymenoptera and security operations, this dissertation will propose innovative strategies that enhance situational awareness, resource allocation, and community engagement.
