# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating health care principles with traditional knowledge systems, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines health and wellness. By examining the intersection of patient-centered care and community-centered approaches, this research seeks to establish a framework that enhances health outcomes for indigenous populations while preserving cultural heritage. The significance of this work lies in its ability to foster interdisciplinary collaboration, promote sustainability, and encourage holistic health practices. The potential impact extends beyond health care, influencing policy, education, and community engagement, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and equitable health landscape.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between health care principles and traditional knowledge systems. Health care has evolved to prioritize patient-centered, holistic approaches, while traditional knowledge emphasizes community practices and sustainability. This convergence offers a unique opportunity to enhance health outcomes by integrating the strengths of both domains.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges the traditional dichotomy between modern health care and indigenous practices, proposing a collaborative framework that respects and utilizes the strengths of both. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of health care principles into traditional knowledge contexts, creating a new paradigm that can enhance health care delivery and cultural preservation.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can health care principles be effectively integrated into traditional knowledge systems?
2. What are the impacts of this integration on health outcomes and community engagement?
3. How can technology facilitate the preservation and dissemination of traditional knowledge in health care contexts?
