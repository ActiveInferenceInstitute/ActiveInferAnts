# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Concepts into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of health care principles and traditional knowledge systems, proposing a transformative framework that enhances community health practices. By investigating how modern health care concepts can be transposed into traditional contexts, this research seeks to create a model of community-centered care that respects cultural heritage while promoting sustainable health practices. The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge gaps between modern health care and traditional practices, thereby improving health outcomes, preserving cultural identities, and fostering ecological stewardship. The findings are expected to contribute to interdisciplinary discourse and inspire practical applications in both health care and community settings.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of health care concepts—focused on patient experience, service quality, technology integration, and patient-centered care—with traditional knowledge systems grounded in sustainability, holistic health practices, cultural practices, and environmental stewardship. This fusion presents a unique opportunity to enhance community health practices by harmonizing modern and traditional approaches.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses the growing need for culturally relevant health care models that are adaptable to diverse communities. By transposing health care principles into traditional knowledge frameworks, this study seeks to create a comprehensive understanding of health that is both inclusive and effective. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that challenges existing paradigms and proposes new lexicons and frameworks for understanding health.
