# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Hymenoptera to Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of principles from Hymenoptera—specifically ants, bees, and wasps—into the health care domain. It aims to develop a transformative framework that enhances patient outcomes, optimizes resource management, and fosters collaborative relationships between patients and providers. By examining the social structures, collective intelligence, and adaptive strategies of Hymenoptera, this research seeks to address current challenges in health care, such as patient engagement, communication, and resource allocation. The potential impact of this work is significant, promising advancements in health care delivery, education, and technology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: Hymenoptera biology and health care. Hymenoptera showcases remarkable social structures and problem-solving strategies that can inform and enhance health care practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it applies biological principles to health care, creating a new interdisciplinary framework. It draws parallels between the organization of ant colonies and health care systems, offering fresh insights into improving patient care and operational efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of collective intelligence from Hymenoptera enhance patient engagement and outcomes in health care?
2. What adaptive strategies from Hymenoptera can be implemented for effective resource management in health care settings?
3. In what ways can specialized roles within health care teams mimic the caste system of ant colonies to improve efficiency and satisfaction?
