# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Visionary Artistry into Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the intersection of William Blake's life and work with the emerging field of quantum computation. By integrating Blake's philosophies, artistic styles, and thematic explorations with the technical and theoretical aspects of quantum computing, this research aims to create a novel interdisciplinary framework. This framework will not only redefine our understanding of quantum computation as a creative and spiritual endeavor but also provide innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in the field. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, educational methodologies, and societal perceptions of technology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking synthesis of the imaginative and philosophical insights of William Blake with the complex, often abstract principles of quantum computation. This intersection allows for a reimagining of both fields, fostering a dialogue that enriches our understanding of creativity and technology.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of quantum computation by framing it as an artistic and imaginative pursuit rather than solely a technical one. The novelty lies in the application of Blake's principles to develop new algorithms, educational frameworks, and interdisciplinary collaborations that could revolutionize quantum computing.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination, contraries, and spirituality inform the development of quantum algorithms?
2. In what ways can an artistic approach to quantum computation enhance educational practices and public engagement?
3. What are the implications of viewing quantum computing through a Blakean lens for both the technology itself and its societal impact?
