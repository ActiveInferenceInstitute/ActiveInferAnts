# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of negotiation principles into the field of astronomy, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters collaborative research, enhances communication, and resolves conflicts among diverse scientific teams. By examining the underlying structures of both negotiation and astronomy, this research will propose new frameworks and methodologies that can improve the effectiveness of scientific inquiry. The potential impact of this work includes advancing collaborative practices in astronomy, enhancing public engagement, and inspiring interdisciplinary approaches across various fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of negotiation and astronomy represents a groundbreaking approach to scientific collaboration. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a tool for resolving conflicts and reaching agreements, can offer valuable insights into the dynamics of teamwork in astronomy, where diverse teams must often navigate complex challenges.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in the current understanding of collaborative practices in astronomy. By applying negotiation theories and strategies, the dissertation will provide a novel perspective on how scientific teams can work together more effectively, paving the way for innovative discoveries and advancements.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles enhance collaboration in astronomical research?
2. What are the cultural factors that influence negotiation styles among international research teams?
3. How can structured negotiation frameworks improve conflict resolution in scientific interpretations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation**: The evolution from informal agreements to structured negotiation theories in business and diplomacy.
- **Astronomy**: The historical progression from ancient celestial observations to modern astrophysics and space exploration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Negotiation**: Emphasis on emotional intelligence, technology integration, and cross-cultural dynamics.
- **Astronomy**: Challenges related to data analysis, international collaboration, and public engagement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the absence of negotiation frameworks in astronomical collaboration presents an opportunity to enhance research practices and outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Negotiation theories (e.g., Fisher and Ury's principled negotiation).
- Collaborative science models in astronomy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
The development of "Astro-negotiation" as a new paradigm for collaborative research.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines negotiation principles with collaborative research frameworks, emphasizing dialogue, relationship-building, and ethical considerations.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques to investigate the impact of negotiation principles in astronomy.

### Data Collection Methods
- Case studies of collaborative astronomical projects.
- Surveys and interviews with astronomers regarding their experiences with negotiation.

### Analytical Approaches
Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical analysis for quantitative surveys.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and integrity in research practices.
