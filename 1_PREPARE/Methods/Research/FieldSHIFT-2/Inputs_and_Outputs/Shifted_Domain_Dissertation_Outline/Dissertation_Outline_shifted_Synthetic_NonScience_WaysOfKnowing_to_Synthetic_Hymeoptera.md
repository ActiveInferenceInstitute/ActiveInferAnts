# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Study of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of non-science ways of knowing—such as cultural narratives, experiential learning, and holistic approaches—into the scientific study of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps). By bridging these two distinct domains, the research aims to redefine ecological understanding and conservation practices, enhancing the richness of Hymenoptera research while fostering community engagement and cultural sensitivity. The potential impact of this work extends to educational frameworks, policy development, and sustainable practices, positioning the candidate as a leader in this emergent interdisciplinary field.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of non-science ways of knowing with the biological study of Hymenoptera represents a significant paradigm shift. Non-scientific methodologies emphasize subjective experience and cultural context, which have been historically marginalized in scientific discourse. Conversely, Hymenoptera research has predominantly relied on quantitative data and reductionist methodologies, often overlooking the cultural significance and ecological interdependence of these species.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional scientific paradigms and advocates for a more inclusive approach to ecological research. By integrating non-science methodologies, we can develop a richer, more nuanced understanding of Hymenoptera and their roles in ecosystems, ultimately informing conservation strategies and fostering community engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance our understanding of Hymenoptera behaviors and ecological roles?
2. What are the implications of integrating cultural narratives and experiential learning into Hymenoptera research?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform conservation practices and community engagement?
