# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Mitochondrial Biology to Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between mitochondrial biology and health care, creating a Shifted Domain that leverages biological principles to enhance patient care and system efficiency. By drawing parallels between mitochondrial functions and health care dynamics, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework for patient empowerment, adaptive care models, and continuous quality improvement. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize health care practices, improve patient outcomes, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. The dissertation will provide actionable insights and theoretical contributions that can inform both academic research and practical applications in health care.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, play a crucial role in energy production and metabolic regulation. In contrast, health care is primarily concerned with delivering quality patient services and optimizing health outcomes. The fusion of these domains allows for a novel approach that utilizes biological principles to inform health care strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it provides a fresh perspective on health care by applying biological concepts. The novelty lies in the transposition of mitochondrial dynamics into health care frameworks, which can lead to more effective patient engagement and service delivery models.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of mitochondrial biology inform and enhance patient empowerment in health care?
2. In what ways can adaptive care models be developed based on mitochondrial dynamics?
3. What frameworks can be established for continuous quality improvement in health care that parallel mitochondrial quality control mechanisms?
