# PhD Dissertation Plan: Non-Science Ways of Knowing Transposed into the Context of Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing into the field of chemistry. By examining the intersection of holistic perspectives, narrative techniques, and experiential learning with traditional chemical practices, this research seeks to establish a new paradigm that enhances understanding, sustainability, and public engagement in chemistry. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both educational methodologies and practical applications in the field, fostering a more inclusive and relevant approach to scientific inquiry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of non-science ways of knowing into chemistry represents a paradigm shift that challenges traditional empirical methodologies. Non-science ways of knowing emphasize intuition, cultural beliefs, and holistic understanding, while chemistry has historically focused on measurable phenomena and reductionist approaches. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform and enrich each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it not only addresses the limitations of reductionist approaches in chemistry but also recognizes the value of indigenous knowledge systems and holistic methodologies. The novelty lies in creating an integrated framework that combines empirical and non-empirical knowledge, promoting sustainability and cultural relevance in chemical practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the understanding of chemical systems?
2. What are the implications of integrating holistic and narrative approaches in chemistry education?
3. How can experiential learning be utilized to bridge the gap between scientific and traditional knowledge?
