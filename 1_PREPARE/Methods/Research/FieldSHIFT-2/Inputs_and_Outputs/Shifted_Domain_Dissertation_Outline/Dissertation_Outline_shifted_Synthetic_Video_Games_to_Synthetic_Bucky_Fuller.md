# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Game Design Principles Applied to Buckminster Fuller’s Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of game design principles and the philosophy of Buckminster Fuller, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines sustainability through engaging and interactive experiences. By employing game mechanics to enhance public engagement and understanding of complex systems, this research intends to revolutionize approaches to sustainability, resource management, and education. The potential impact of this work includes fostering deeper connections to environmental issues, promoting sustainable practices, and inspiring interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the principles of game design—focused on player engagement, narrative integration, and iterative processes—with Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy of holistic thinking and sustainable design. This integration offers a novel framework for addressing pressing global challenges by transforming how individuals and communities interact with sustainability concepts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of sustainability, which often appear technical and disengaging. By applying game design principles, it proposes a more interactive and relatable approach, making sustainability accessible and engaging. The novelty lies in the synthesis of these two distinct fields, creating a new paradigm for education, policy, and community engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles enhance public engagement in sustainability initiatives?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating narrative elements into sustainability education?
3. In what ways can iterative design processes improve resource management practices?
4. What frameworks can be developed to facilitate the application of game design in sustainability contexts?
