# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Spatial Web into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Spatial Web—comprising technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)—with Traditional Knowledge systems rooted in indigenous and local community practices. This Shifted Domain seeks to uncover new methodologies for sustainable resource management, cultural preservation, and community resilience. By establishing a robust theoretical framework and empirical research agenda, this work will contribute significantly to both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and generating practical applications that enhance societal well-being and ecological sustainability.

## Introduction
