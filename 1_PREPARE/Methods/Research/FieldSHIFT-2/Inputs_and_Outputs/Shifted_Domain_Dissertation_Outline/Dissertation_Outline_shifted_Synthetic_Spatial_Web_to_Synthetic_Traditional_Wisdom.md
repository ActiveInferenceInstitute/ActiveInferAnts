# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating the Spatial Web with Traditional Knowledge, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters innovative approaches to sustainable resource management, cultural preservation, and community engagement. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT), this research aims to enhance the transmission of traditional ecological practices, improve decision-making processes, and empower indigenous communities. The findings have the potential to revolutionize both fields, offering a roadmap for future research and practical applications that respect and elevate traditional knowledge systems.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of the Spatial Web—characterized by its integration of digital and physical environments—and Traditional Knowledge, which embodies the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities. This convergence presents an unprecedented opportunity to rethink how we engage with both technology and culture, fostering a more holistic understanding of our environment.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both the Spatial Web and Traditional Knowledge domains, proposing innovative frameworks that bridge technological advancements with cultural heritage. By exploring the synergies between these fields, the dissertation aims to contribute to sustainable development, cultural revitalization, and enhanced community resilience.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can technologies from the Spatial Web enhance the transmission and application of Traditional Knowledge?
2. What are the implications of creating digital twins of ecosystems managed by indigenous communities?
3. How can community engagement be fostered through the integration of AR and VR in traditional practices?
