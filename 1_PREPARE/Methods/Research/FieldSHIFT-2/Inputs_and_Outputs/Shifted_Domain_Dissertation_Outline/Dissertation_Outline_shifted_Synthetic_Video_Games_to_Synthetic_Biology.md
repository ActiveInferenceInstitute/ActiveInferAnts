# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Game Design Principles into Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating game design principles into the field of biology, particularly in ecological conservation and education. By leveraging the engagement strategies, feedback mechanisms, and narrative techniques found in game design, the research seeks to create innovative frameworks for enhancing public awareness, participation, and understanding of biodiversity and ecological systems. The anticipated impact includes improved conservation strategies, enriched educational methodologies, and the emergence of new interdisciplinary fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of game design and biology, where the principles of engaging gameplay can inform ecological understanding and conservation efforts. This fusion emerges from the recognition that both domains rely on complex systems of interaction and feedback, and both benefit from innovative approaches to engagement and education.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to revolutionize how we approach ecological education and conservation. By applying game design methodologies, we can create more compelling and effective means of engaging the public in biodiversity issues, thus addressing critical challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles enhance public engagement in ecological conservation efforts?
2. In what ways can feedback mechanisms from game design inform adaptive management strategies in ecology?
3. What narrative techniques from game design can be integrated into ecological education to improve information retention and emotional connection?
