# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The origins of blockchain technology can be traced back to Bitcoin in 2009, followed by the introduction of smart contracts with Ethereum. The evolution of blockchain has led to various applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, and identity verification.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current trends in blockchain focus on financial applications, enterprise solutions, and the development of decentralized applications (DApps). However, challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and governance remain prevalent.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in blockchain technology, there is a lack of research on decentralized governance models and their impact on community engagement. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by exploring the intersection of blockchain principles and governance.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The dissertation will draw upon foundational theories such as decentralized networks, trustlessness, and consensus mechanisms to establish a theoretical basis for the Shifted Domain.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

New theoretical constructs will emerge from the reimagined application of blockchain principles, including decentralized governance and dynamic consensus models.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be proposed, combining elements from both original domains to create a cohesive framework for understanding the implications of the Shifted Domain.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

The research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods to explore the impact of decentralized governance on blockchain projects.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and case studies of existing blockchain projects that have implemented decentralized governance models.

## Analytical Approaches

Analytical approaches will include statistical analysis of survey data, thematic analysis of qualitative data, and comparative case studies to identify best practices.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be addressed by ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and adhering to ethical research guidelines.
