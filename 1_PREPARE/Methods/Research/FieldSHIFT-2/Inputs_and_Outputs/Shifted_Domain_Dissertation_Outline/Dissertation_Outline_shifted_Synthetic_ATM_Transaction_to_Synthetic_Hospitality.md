# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing ATM Transaction Concepts into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of ATM transaction principles into enhancing guest experiences within the hospitality sector. By analyzing the core functionalities of ATMs—self-service, security, and user experience—and transposing these elements into hospitality settings, this research seeks to develop a framework that will revolutionize guest interactions. The significance of this research lies in its potential to improve operational efficiency, increase guest satisfaction, and establish new standards for service delivery in hospitality. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also offer practical applications for industry stakeholders, ultimately driving innovation in guest experience management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on personalized service and guest satisfaction. However, with the rise of technology and changing consumer behaviors, there is a pressing need to adapt and innovate. ATMs exemplify a successful model of self-service and efficiency that can be mirrored in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it bridges two distinct fields—banking technology and hospitality management—by applying transaction flow methodologies to enhance guest experiences. The integration of self-service kiosks and biometric security measures presents a unique opportunity to redefine service delivery in hospitality.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ATM transaction principles enhance guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the impacts of self-service technologies on guest satisfaction and operational efficiency?
3. How can security measures from ATM systems be adapted to improve guest perceptions of safety in hospitality settings?
