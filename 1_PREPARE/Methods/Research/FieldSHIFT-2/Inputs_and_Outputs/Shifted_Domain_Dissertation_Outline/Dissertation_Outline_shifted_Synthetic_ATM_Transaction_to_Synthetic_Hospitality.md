# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing ATM Transaction Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transaction principles into the guest experience within the hospitality sector. By examining the core principles of self-service operations, transaction flows, security protocols, user experience design, and feedback mechanisms from the ATM domain, this research aims to develop a framework that enhances guest satisfaction, operational efficiency, and brand loyalty in hospitality. The significance of this study lies in its potential to transform traditional service paradigms, addressing contemporary challenges such as personalization, privacy, and technology integration. The findings will provide actionable insights for industry practitioners and contribute to the academic discourse on service design and guest experience.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has faced increasing demands for personalized service, efficient operations, and enhanced security. Concurrently, the banking sector has successfully implemented self-service technologies through ATMs, which empower users to conduct transactions independently. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that merges these two domains, leveraging ATM transaction concepts to enhance the guest experience in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between two traditionally distinct fields. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ATM principles to hospitality, offering a fresh perspective on service delivery that prioritizes guest autonomy, efficiency, and security. By addressing the challenges faced by both sectors, the study aims to create a new paradigm for guest interaction and operational excellence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can self-service technologies from the ATM domain be effectively integrated into the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What structured interaction flows can enhance operational efficiency and guest satisfaction?
3. How do enhanced security protocols influence guest trust and loyalty in hospitality settings?
4. What are the implications of this integration for training, technology adoption, and service design in the hospitality industry?
