# Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing ATM transaction concepts into the healthcare context, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that enhances patient engagement, streamlines healthcare processes, and safeguards data privacy. By leveraging principles from the banking sector, such as self-service, transaction flow, security measures, and interoperability, this research seeks to address critical challenges in healthcare, including patient empowerment, care continuity, and data protection. The findings promise to not only contribute to academic discourse but also inform practical applications that can revolutionize patient experiences and outcomes in the healthcare system.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The healthcare sector is increasingly integrating technology to improve patient care and streamline operations. Concurrently, the banking sector has perfected self-service transaction systems through ATMs, which provide secure, efficient, and user-friendly experiences. This dissertation proposes a unique synthesis of these two domains, exploring how ATM transaction principles can be effectively applied to healthcare.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for patient-centered care through innovative technological solutions. The novelty lies in the systematic application of well-established banking practices to healthcare, offering new insights into patient engagement and operational efficiency.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can self-service technologies from the banking sector enhance patient engagement in healthcare?
- What standardized care pathways can be developed akin to ATM transaction flows?
- How can robust data security measures be integrated into patient self-service applications?
- What are the implications of this transposed framework for healthcare providers and patients?
