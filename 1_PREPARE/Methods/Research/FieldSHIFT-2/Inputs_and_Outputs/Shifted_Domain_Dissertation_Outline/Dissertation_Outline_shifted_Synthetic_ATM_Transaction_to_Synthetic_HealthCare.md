## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an intersection between the fields of ATM transactions and healthcare patient experience. ATMs have evolved to prioritize user autonomy, security, and real-time feedback, while healthcare is increasingly recognizing the importance of patient-centered care. This dissertation seeks to analyze these domains and transpose successful elements from one to the other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective on patient experience by applying established methodologies from ATM transactions. It highlights the importance of user-friendly interfaces, real-time communication, and robust security protocols, aiming to create a more efficient and satisfying healthcare experience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles from ATM transactions be integrated into healthcare to enhance patient experience?
- What are the expected impacts of implementing self-service technologies on patient satisfaction and engagement?
- How can real-time feedback mechanisms improve patient adherence to treatment plans?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The introduction of ATMs in the late 1960s revolutionized banking, allowing for 24/7 access to financial services. In contrast, healthcare has evolved from a provider-centered model to a patient-centered approach, emphasizing the importance of patient experience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in ATM transactions focuses on user interface design, security, and the integration of technology. In healthcare, studies emphasize patient engagement, communication barriers, and the impact of technology on care delivery.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements, both fields face significant challengesâ€”ATMs in enhancing user engagement and healthcare in streamlining patient interactions. The Shifted Domain presents an opportunity to leverage successful strategies from banking to address these gaps.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **User-Centered Design**: Principles guiding interface design in ATMs.
- **Patient-Centered Care**: Framework emphasizing the importance of patient involvement in their care.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Patient Transaction Flow**: A new model for understanding patient interactions similar to ATM transaction flows.
- **Real-Time Patient Engagement Theory**: A framework for analyzing the impact of immediate feedback on patient behavior.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines user-centered design from banking with patient-centered care in healthcare, emphasizing real-time feedback and security.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data to assess the impact of implementing ATM-inspired technologies in healthcare settings.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys**: To gauge patient satisfaction and engagement pre- and post-implementation of self-service kiosks.
- **Interviews**: With healthcare professionals to understand the challenges and benefits of new technologies.
- **Pilot Programs**: For testing the effectiveness of proposed innovations.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis**: To evaluate survey data.
- **Thematic Analysis**: For qualitative interview data.
- **Comparative Case Studies**: To analyze pilot program outcomes.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring patient data confidentiality and adherence to ethical guidelines in healthcare research.
- Obtaining informed consent from all participants.
