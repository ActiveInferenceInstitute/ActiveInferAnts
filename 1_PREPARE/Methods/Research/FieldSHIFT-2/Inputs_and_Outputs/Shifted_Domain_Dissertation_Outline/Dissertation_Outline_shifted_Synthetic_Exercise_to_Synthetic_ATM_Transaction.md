# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Exercise into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of exercise principles with ATM transactions, creating a novel Shifted Domain that enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and financial literacy. By applying methodologies from exercise science to the realm of banking, this research aims to develop personalized transaction pathways, gamification strategies, and educational modules that promote both financial health and physical well-being. The potential impact of this research extends beyond the banking sector, offering insights into user experience design, community engagement, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a pioneering intersection between the fields of exercise science and banking technology, specifically focusing on ATM transactions. As society increasingly recognizes the importance of holistic health—encompassing both physical and financial wellness—this research seeks to bridge the gap between these two domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation addresses the lack of interdisciplinary approaches in user experience design for ATMs, proposing that principles of exercise can enhance user interaction and satisfaction. The novelty lies in the application of exercise methodologies to banking services, providing a framework for personalized and engaging user experiences.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can exercise principles be effectively transposed into ATM transaction design?
- What impact do personalized and gamified ATM experiences have on user engagement and satisfaction?
- In what ways can ATMs serve as platforms for promoting financial literacy and health education?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Exercise:** Development from basic physical activity to structured fitness programs and therapeutic interventions.
- **ATM Transactions:** Evolution from manual banking to automated, self-service banking solutions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Overview of exercise methodologies, user engagement strategies in fitness, and the technological advancements in ATM design.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research connecting exercise science with financial technology.
- Opportunities for enhancing user experience and promoting holistic wellness through ATM services.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Exercise Science:** Theories of motivation, progressive overload, and user-centered design.
- **Banking Technology:** User experience design principles, security protocols, and transaction efficiency.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Transaction Fitness:** Optimization of ATM usage for user satisfaction.
- **Progressive Transaction Design (PTD):** Gradual introduction of complex features based on user familiarity.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model combining principles from both domains to enhance user engagement and promote financial literacy.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to assess user experiences and engagement with ATMs.

### Data Collection Methods
