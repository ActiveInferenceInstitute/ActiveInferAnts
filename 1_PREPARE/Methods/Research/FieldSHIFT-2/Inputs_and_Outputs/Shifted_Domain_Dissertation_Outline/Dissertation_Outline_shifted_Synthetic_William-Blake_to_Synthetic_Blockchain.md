# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions with blockchain technology. It aims to articulate how Blake's themes of imagination, contraries, and spirituality can inform and transform the understanding and application of blockchain. By developing a new lexicon, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications, this research seeks to illuminate the potential for blockchain to not only facilitate transactions but also foster creativity and community engagement. The findings could revolutionize both the art world and blockchain governance, providing significant contributions to interdisciplinary scholarship.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of William Blake's life and work with blockchain technology represents a unique interdisciplinary domain that combines literature, art, philosophy, and cutting-edge technology. This shift offers a rich landscape for exploration, as both fields challenge traditional notions of ownership, creativity, and societal values.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it reinterprets Blake's enduring themes within a modern technological framework. It provides a novel perspective that emphasizes the ethical and creative dimensions of blockchain, positioning it as a medium for artistic expression rather than mere transactional utility.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's artistic principles inform the development of blockchain technologies?
2. In what ways can blockchain serve as a platform for artistic expression that aligns with Blakean themes?
3. What new governance models can emerge from integrating Blake's ideas of contraries into blockchain systems?
