# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of William Blake's artistic and philosophical principles with blockchain technology. It aims to create a new framework that emphasizes creativity, community engagement, and spiritual exploration within decentralized systems. By articulating how Blake's concepts of imagination, contraries, and collective consciousness can inform blockchain governance and functionality, this research seeks to redefine the intersection of art and technology, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and visionary approach to blockchain systems. The potential impact of this work spans academia, industry, and society, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
William Blake, an influential artist and poet of the Romantic era, challenged societal norms through his unique blend of visual art and poetry. His exploration of spirituality and the human experience resonates with contemporary movements advocating for decentralization and community governance in blockchain technology. Blockchain, a decentralized ledger technology, offers transparency and security but often lacks the imaginative and artistic dimensions present in Blake's work.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two seemingly disparate fields—art and technology—by demonstrating how Blake's ideals can enrich blockchain applications. The novelty lies in proposing a theoretical framework that integrates artistic expression into blockchain governance, potentially transforming how we perceive and utilize this technology.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can William Blake's philosophical principles inform the development of blockchain technology?
- In what ways can blockchain serve as a medium for artistic expression and community engagement?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of Blakean philosophy with blockchain?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of William Blake's life, artistic contributions, and philosophical insights.
- Development of blockchain technology, its key principles, and current applications.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
