# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Free Energy Principle in Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) within the healthcare domain, proposing a novel framework that enhances patient care through predictive processing, active inference, and adaptive systems thinking. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by improving patient outcomes, satisfaction, and engagement. By systematically analyzing the interplay between FEP and healthcare, this dissertation will contribute to both theoretical advancements and practical applications, paving the way for a new paradigm in patient-centered care.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a unifying framework for understanding adaptive behavior in biological systems. In healthcare, this principle can be applied to enhance patient experiences and outcomes by framing care as a dynamic process of prediction and adaptation. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between cognitive science and healthcare, introducing innovative methodologies for improving patient-provider interactions. The novelty lies in the systematic application of FEP concepts, such as predictive processing and active inference, to real-world healthcare challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the Free Energy Principle be operationalized to enhance patient care in healthcare settings?
- What is the impact of predictive processing on patient satisfaction and health outcomes?
- In what ways can active patient engagement reduce variational free energy in treatment adherence?
- How do Markov blankets influence the quality of patient-provider communication?

## Literature Review
