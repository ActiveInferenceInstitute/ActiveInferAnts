# PhD Dissertation Plan: Free Energy Principle and Active Inference in Healthcare

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of applying the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) from cognitive neuroscience to the healthcare domain. By reimagining healthcare delivery, patient experience, and outcomes through this interdisciplinary lens, the research seeks to establish a new paradigm in healthcare that prioritizes predictive modeling and active patient engagement. This work is expected to significantly impact both cognitive neuroscience and healthcare, fostering innovative practices that enhance patient satisfaction and health outcomes while offering a robust framework for future research in these fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize free energy to maintain homeostasis, while Active Inference suggests that organisms act to confirm predictions and reduce surprise through environmental interactions. When applied to healthcare, these principles can reshape how care is delivered and experienced.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research represents a novel intersection of cognitive neuroscience and healthcare, proposing a framework that emphasizes predictive models and active patient engagement. By integrating these concepts, the dissertation aims to address existing challenges in healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of FEP and AI be integrated into healthcare delivery models?
2. What are the implications of predictive modeling for patient engagement and satisfaction?
3. How can healthcare systems minimize variational free energy to improve patient outcomes?
