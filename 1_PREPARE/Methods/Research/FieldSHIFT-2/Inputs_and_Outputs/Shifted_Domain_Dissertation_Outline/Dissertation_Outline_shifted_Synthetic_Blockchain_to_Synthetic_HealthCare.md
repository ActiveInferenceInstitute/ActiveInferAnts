# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Blockchain Technology into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology into the health care sector. By merging the principles of decentralization, transparency, and security inherent in blockchain with the evolving paradigms of patient-centered care, this research seeks to address longstanding challenges such as data silos, inefficiencies, and privacy concerns. The proposed research will not only contribute to the academic understanding of this Shifted Domain but also offer practical applications that can significantly enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiencies in health care. The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications for both fields, potentially leading to new sub-disciplines and innovations.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of blockchain technology and health care marks a significant paradigm shift. Blockchain, originally designed to support cryptocurrencies, has evolved into a versatile technology with applications in various sectors, including supply chain management and identity verification. Health care, characterized by fragmented data systems and a focus on patient-centered care, presents an ideal landscape for the application of blockchain principles, offering opportunities for enhanced data sharing, security, and patient engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to revolutionize how health care data is managed and shared. By addressing critical issues such as data integrity, patient privacy, and administrative inefficiencies, the integration of blockchain can lead to improved health outcomes and a more equitable health care system. This dissertation represents a novel approach by synthesizing knowledge from both blockchain and health care domains, creating a framework for future research and practical applications.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can blockchain technology be effectively integrated into health care systems to enhance data management and patient care?
- What are the potential impacts of decentralized health data systems on patient privacy, care coordination, and operational efficiencies?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of blockchain and health care, and how can they inform future research?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Originating with Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has evolved to support diverse applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain management and decentralized finance.
- **Health Care:** The field has transitioned from paper-based records to electronic health records (EHRs), with increasing reliance on technology for diagnosis and patient engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Blockchain:** Current trends focus on interoperability, scalability, and the integration of blockchain with emerging technologies like AI and IoT.
- **Health Care:** The sector faces challenges such as data silos, privacy concerns, and the need for improved care coordination.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite the growing interest in both fields, there remains a lack of comprehensive research on the integration of blockchain into health care. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by exploring the synergies between the two domains and proposing innovative solutions to existing challenges.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Blockchain Theories:** Decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
- **Health Care Theories:** Patient-centered care, data interoperability, and health information exchange.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Decentralized Health Information Exchange (DHIE):** A framework for sharing health data across decentralized networks.
- **Blockchain-Enhanced Patient Engagement (BPEE):** A model for understanding how blockchain can empower patients in their health care journey.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the interactions between blockchain technology and health care systems, highlighting the potential for improved data management, patient empowerment, and care coordination.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of blockchain in health care.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys and Interviews:** Gather perspectives from health care professionals, patients, and blockchain experts.
- **Pilot Studies:** Implement blockchain solutions in selected health care settings to collect quantitative data on outcomes.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis:** To evaluate the impact of blockchain on operational efficiencies and patient outcomes.
- **Thematic Analysis:** To identify key themes and insights from qualitative data.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will include ensuring patient privacy, obtaining informed consent, and addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis.
