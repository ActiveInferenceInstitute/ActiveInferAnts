# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing with culinary practices. By examining the core principles of non-science epistemologies—such as intuition, cultural narratives, and holistic understanding—and their application in cuisine, this research seeks to challenge conventional culinary paradigms that prioritize scientific methodologies. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enrich culinary education, enhance sustainability, and foster deeper cultural connections through food. This dissertation will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and applying these interdisciplinary insights within culinary arts.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between non-science ways of knowing and culinary arts, where subjective experiences, cultural narratives, and holistic approaches inform culinary practices. This domain recognizes the value of diverse epistemologies in shaping culinary knowledge and practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the dominance of reductionist scientific approaches in cuisine, advocating for a more inclusive understanding that values tradition, personal experience, and cultural context. It offers a fresh perspective on culinary arts that can lead to innovative practices and educational frameworks.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing enhance culinary practices and education?
- What are the implications of integrating indigenous knowledge systems into modern cuisine?
- How does emotional intelligence influence creativity and satisfaction in cooking?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Exploration of indigenous knowledge systems, oral traditions, and holistic philosophies.
- **Cuisine:** Historical evolution of culinary practices, cultural significance, and the impact of globalization.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of existing literature on non-science epistemologies and their applications in various fields.
- Examination of contemporary culinary practices and the scientific principles underlying them.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary research that combines non-science ways of knowing with culinary arts.
- Opportunities for innovation in culinary education and practice through the integration of diverse epistemologies.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Constructivist Epistemology:** Understanding knowledge as constructed through experiences and interactions.
- **Cultural Theory:** Examining how culture shapes knowledge and practices within culinary contexts.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Culinary Intuition:** A framework for understanding decision-making in cooking based on personal experience.
- **Cultural Flavor Profiles:** Conceptualizing the unique tastes and aromas that embody cultural narratives.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- An integrated model that combines insights from non-science ways of knowing and culinary arts, emphasizing the interconnectedness of culture, emotion, and technique.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing in culinary practices.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with chefs, culinary educators, and cultural practitioners to gather insights on their experiences and practices.
- **Workshops:** Organize experiential workshops that blend traditional cooking methods with non-science epistemologies.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and workshops.
- Statistical analysis of quantitative data collected through surveys measuring participant satisfaction and creativity.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from participants.
- Respecting cultural sensitivities and knowledge ownership in the context of indigenous knowledge systems.
