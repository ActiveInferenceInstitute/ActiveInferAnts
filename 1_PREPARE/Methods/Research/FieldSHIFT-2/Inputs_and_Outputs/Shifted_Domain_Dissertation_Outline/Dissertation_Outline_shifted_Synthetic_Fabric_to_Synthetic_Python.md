# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of Python Programming

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of merging the fabric industry and arts with Python programming, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters creativity, sustainability, and craftsmanship in software development. By drawing parallels between textile design principles and programming methodologies, the research will develop innovative frameworks, methodologies, and tools that enhance both fields. The anticipated impact includes novel educational approaches, interdisciplinary collaborations, and advancements in sustainable software practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has historically been a blend of artistry and technology, characterized by creativity, sustainability, and technical innovation. Python, a versatile programming language, is widely used in various domains but often lacks the artistic and sustainable perspectives found in the fabric industry. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, exploring how principles from the fabric industry can enrich Python programming.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for sustainability and creativity in software development. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that combines artistic principles with technical programming skills, offering fresh insights and methodologies that can redefine both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can textile design principles inform and enhance software architecture in Python programming?
2. What sustainable practices from the fabric industry can be applied to software development?
3. How can interdisciplinary collaborations between textile designers and software engineers foster innovation in both domains?
