# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Intelligent Soft Matter

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with Intelligent Soft Matter. By transposing core concepts from adaptive biological systems into the realm of responsive materials, this research seeks to develop a new framework for understanding and designing intelligent soft materials that can sense, process, and act in real-time. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize material science and engineering, leading to advancements in various applications, including biomedical devices, robotics, and environmental sustainability. The findings will contribute to the foundational knowledge of both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that all adaptive systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept that has profound implications for understanding behavior in biological organisms. Intelligent soft matter, on the other hand, refers to materials that can autonomously respond to environmental stimuli. This dissertation will bridge these two domains, creating a novel perspective on material behavior through the lens of adaptive biological principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a transformative framework that applies biological principles to the design of intelligent materials. By leveraging concepts such as predictive processing and active inference, this work will pioneer the development of materials that not only respond to stimuli but also anticipate and adapt to changes in their environment.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to design intelligent soft materials?
2. What novel properties and functionalities can emerge from the integration of adaptive behaviors in soft materials?
3. How can predictive models enhance the responsiveness and adaptability of intelligent soft matter?
