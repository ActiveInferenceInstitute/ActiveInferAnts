# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience into Ecosystem Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and ecosystem management practices. By transposing core elements of personalization, service delivery, technology integration, and sustainability from Domain A (Guest Experience) into Domain B (Ecosystems), this research will develop new frameworks and models that enhance biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize conservation strategies, promote sustainable practices, and foster a deeper connection between humans and nature.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalized service, technological integration, and sustainable practices. Conversely, ecosystem management has traditionally centered on biodiversity conservation and ecological balance. This dissertation will explore how the principles of guest experience can inform and transform ecosystem management, creating a new paradigm for both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to merging two distinct domains, creating a framework that not only addresses ecological challenges but also emphasizes human engagement and satisfaction. By applying guest experience principles to ecosystems, we can develop tailored conservation strategies that resonate with local communities and stakeholders, ultimately leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of guest experience be effectively transposed into ecosystem management?
- What are the potential benefits of personalized ecosystem management strategies on biodiversity conservation?
- How can technology enhance the monitoring and management of ecosystems in a manner similar to guest experience technologies in hospitality?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
