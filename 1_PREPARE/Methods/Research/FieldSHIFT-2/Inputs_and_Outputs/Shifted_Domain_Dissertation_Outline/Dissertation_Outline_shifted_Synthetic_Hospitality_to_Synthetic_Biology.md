# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Guest Experience in Hospitality into Ecosystem Dynamics in Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles of guest experience from the hospitality industry into the study of ecosystem dynamics in biology. By establishing a novel framework that emphasizes interaction, personalization, and co-creation, this research seeks to enhance biodiversity, resilience, and community engagement in ecosystem management. The significance of this study lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which not only challenges traditional ecological assumptions but also offers practical applications for enhancing ecosystem services and fostering sustainable practices. The anticipated impact of this work includes contributions to both hospitality and ecological management fields, paving the way for innovative educational programs and technological advancements.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on optimizing guest experiences through personalization, service quality, and emotional engagement. Concurrently, ecosystem dynamics in biology emphasize the intricate interactions among organisms and their environment, stressing the importance of biodiversity and resilience. This dissertation seeks to fuse these two domains, exploring how principles of guest experience can inform and enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research represents a pioneering exploration of the intersections between hospitality and ecology, providing a fresh perspective on both fields. The novelty lies in applying concepts from guest experience to ecological management, which has the potential to revolutionize how we approach conservation and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of guest experience enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics?
- What are the potential benefits of integrating hospitality concepts into ecological management practices?
- How can community engagement and personalization improve biodiversity and resilience in ecosystems?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
