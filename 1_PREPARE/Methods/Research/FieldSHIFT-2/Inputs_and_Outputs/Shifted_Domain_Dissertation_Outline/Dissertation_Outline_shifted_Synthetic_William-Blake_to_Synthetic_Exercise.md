# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Exercise Science

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions with contemporary exercise science, proposing a transformative framework that integrates imagination, creativity, and spirituality into fitness paradigms. By examining Blake's concepts of contraries and the interplay of imagination and reason, this research aims to redefine exercise science, fostering a holistic approach that enhances physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The potential impact of this study extends beyond academia, influencing fitness practices, mental health strategies, and educational curricula, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive understanding of health.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's life and work with exercise science represents a unique interdisciplinary approach that draws on the rich philosophical and artistic legacy of the Romantic era and the empirical rigor of modern health sciences. This domain shift seeks to bridge the gap between the imaginative insights of Blake and the practical applications of exercise science, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of human health.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to challenge traditional paradigms in exercise science, which often prioritize physical outcomes over psychological and spiritual dimensions. By integrating Blake's emphasis on imagination and holistic experience, this dissertation proposes a novel framework that recognizes the importance of creativity and personal vision in motivating individuals to engage in physical activity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and contraries be integrated into exercise science to enhance motivation and adherence to fitness regimens?
2. What are the potential mental health benefits of incorporating imaginative practices into exercise programs?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform new educational models in exercise science?
