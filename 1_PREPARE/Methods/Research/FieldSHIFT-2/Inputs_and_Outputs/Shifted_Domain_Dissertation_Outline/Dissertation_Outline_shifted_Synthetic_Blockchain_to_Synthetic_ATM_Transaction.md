# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Concepts into the ATM Transaction Context

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of blockchain technology into the traditional Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transaction landscape. By examining the core principles of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, immutability, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms—and applying them to the existing ATM infrastructure, this research aims to propose a transformative model that enhances security, improves user experience, and fosters financial inclusion. The potential impact of this research extends beyond the banking sector, offering insights into interdisciplinary applications and paving the way for new sub-disciplines in fintech and human-computer interaction.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of blockchain technology and ATM transactions represents a significant paradigm shift in financial services. While blockchain has revolutionized digital currencies and decentralized finance, traditional ATMs remain largely centralized and vulnerable to security threats. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these two domains, leveraging blockchain's strengths to address the challenges faced by ATM networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical issues such as fraud, user experience, and interoperability within ATM networks. By proposing a blockchain-based ATM model, the dissertation not only contributes to the academic literature but also offers practical solutions that could reshape the banking landscape. The novelty lies in the application of blockchain principles to a well-established yet outdated system, creating a new framework for financial transactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology be effectively integrated into ATM transactions to enhance security and user experience?
2. What are the potential impacts of decentralized ATM networks on financial inclusion?
3. How can smart contracts streamline ATM processes and improve transaction efficiency?
