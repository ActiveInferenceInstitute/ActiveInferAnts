# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming ATM Transactions through Blockchain Technology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a comprehensive exploration of the integration of blockchain technology into Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions, a Shifted Domain that promises to revolutionize the way users interact with financial services. By analyzing the core principles of blockchain—decentralization, immutability, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and tokenization—this research aims to develop innovative ATM solutions that enhance security, efficiency, and accessibility. The potential impact of this research extends to redefining banking infrastructure, improving user experience, and fostering financial inclusion, particularly for unbanked populations. This dissertation will provide a detailed roadmap for a doctoral candidate to contribute significantly to this emerging field, culminating in a series of empirical studies, theoretical advancements, and practical applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of blockchain technology and traditional ATM systems. Blockchain, a decentralized and immutable ledger technology, has gained prominence since the advent of Bitcoin in 2009. In contrast, ATMs have long been a staple of banking, facilitating cash transactions and other financial services. The intersection of these two domains offers an unprecedented opportunity to innovate and enhance the functionality of ATMs.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to disrupt traditional banking models and improve user experiences. By leveraging blockchain's features, we can address critical challenges faced by ATM systems, such as security vulnerabilities, high operational costs, and limited access for unbanked populations. This research is novel in its approach to systematically integrate blockchain elements into ATM transactions, thereby creating a new paradigm in financial services.
