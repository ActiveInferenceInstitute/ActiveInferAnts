# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of negotiation principles with Buckminster Fuller’s design science philosophy, creating a Shifted Domain that addresses global challenges through collaborative problem-solving. The research will articulate an integrative framework that enhances negotiation practices by incorporating Fuller's concepts of sustainability, systems thinking, and holistic design. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to revolutionize both negotiation strategies and design science, offering new pathways for effective resource management and global cooperation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of negotiation—a field traditionally focused on conflict resolution and agreement-making—and Buckminster Fuller’s design science, which emphasizes holistic, sustainable solutions to complex global problems. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform and enhance one another, leading to innovative approaches to negotiation that prioritize sustainability and collaboration.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of negotiation with Fuller's principles represents a novel approach to addressing contemporary issues such as climate change, resource scarcity, and social inequality. This research is significant as it not only contributes to academic discourse but also offers practical solutions that can be applied in various sectors, including international relations, environmental policy, and organizational management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be redefined through the lens of Buckminster Fuller’s design science?
2. What frameworks can be developed to facilitate collaborative negotiation processes that prioritize sustainability?
3. In what ways can the integration of these domains lead to innovative solutions for global challenges?
