# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and Buckminster Fuller’s holistic design philosophy. By synthesizing these two domains, the research will develop a transformative framework for collaborative design that emphasizes ethical practices, cultural sensitivity, and adaptability. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to redefine negotiation as an integral component of design science, fostering sustainable solutions that benefit diverse stakeholders. This dissertation will contribute significantly to both negotiation theory and design practice, paving the way for new interdisciplinary methodologies and educational paradigms.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the principles of negotiation—a process aimed at achieving mutually beneficial agreements—with Buckminster Fuller’s comprehensive design philosophy, which emphasizes sustainability and interconnectedness. This integration presents a unique opportunity to enhance design processes by embedding negotiation strategies within them.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between negotiation and design, proposing a new paradigm where negotiation is seen as a design dialogue. By doing so, it opens up pathways for innovative solutions to complex global challenges, aligning with Fuller’s vision of a sustainable future.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles enhance collaborative design processes?
2. What frameworks can be developed to integrate negotiation strategies into design science?
3. How can cultural sensitivity and ethical considerations be incorporated into this integrated approach?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation**: Overview of key theories and practices in negotiation, including integrative and distributive approaches.
- **Buckminster Fuller**: Examination of Fuller's major works, including Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science and Synergetics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of contemporary negotiation practices and their applications in various fields, including business and conflict resolution.
- Analysis of current design methodologies influenced by Fuller’s principles, focusing on sustainability and system thinking.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary research connecting negotiation and design.
- Exploration of opportunities for developing new frameworks that address complex, multifaceted problems.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Negotiation Theory**: Key concepts such as BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) and the dual concern model.
- **Design Science**: Principles of systems thinking and sustainability from Fuller's work.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Negotiation as Design Dialogue**: A conceptual framework that positions negotiation as a collaborative design process.
- **Synergetic Design**: The emergent properties of solutions arising from collaborative efforts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that illustrates the interdependence of negotiation and design, highlighting how each can inform and enhance the other.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative case studies with quantitative surveys to explore the integration of negotiation in design.

### Data Collection Methods
- Interviews with design practitioners and negotiators.
- Surveys assessing the effectiveness of negotiation strategies in design projects.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for survey data to identify correlations and trends.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from participants and maintaining confidentiality of sensitive information.
