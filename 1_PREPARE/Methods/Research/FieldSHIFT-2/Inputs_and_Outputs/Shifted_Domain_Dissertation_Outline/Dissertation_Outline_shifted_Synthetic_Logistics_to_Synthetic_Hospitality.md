# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of logistics and guest experience, proposing a transformative framework that leverages logistics principles to enhance the hospitality sector. As the hospitality industry faces evolving guest expectations and operational challenges, integrating logistics methodologies offers unprecedented opportunities for optimizing service delivery, improving guest satisfaction, and promoting sustainability. The research aims to establish a new interdisciplinary paradigm that not only enriches the guest experience but also redefines operational efficiency, positioning hospitality businesses as leaders in both service excellence and environmental responsibility.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain encapsulates the intersection of logistics and guest experience, two traditionally distinct fields. Logistics focuses on the efficient movement and management of goods and services, while guest experience emphasizes the holistic interactions between guests and hospitality establishments. This dissertation aims to synthesize these domains, revealing insights and methodologies that can enhance operational practices within the hospitality sector.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it addresses the pressing need for hospitality businesses to adapt to rapidly changing consumer expectations. By applying logistics principles—such as supply chain management, just-in-time service delivery, and real-time tracking—this study explores how these methodologies can be transposed to improve guest interactions, operational efficiency, and sustainability in hospitality.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into the guest experience to enhance service delivery?
2. What are the potential impacts of this integration on guest satisfaction, operational efficiency, and sustainability?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach, and how can they be operationalized in hospitality practices?

# Literature Review
## Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Logistics:** Tracing the evolution from basic transportation to advanced supply chain management.
- **Guest Experience:** Examining the shift from service delivery to a focus on emotional connections and personalization.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Logistics:** Current trends include automation, data analytics, and sustainability practices.
- **Guest Experience:** Emphasis on personalization, technology integration, and evolving guest expectations.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges logistics and guest experience.
- Opportunities to apply logistics methodologies to enhance operational practices in hospitality.

# Theoretical Framework
## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Logistics Theories:** Supply chain management, inventory optimization, and risk management.
- **Guest Experience Theories:** Service quality models, customer satisfaction frameworks, and emotional engagement theories.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Service Chain Management (SCM):** Integrating logistics principles into hospitality service delivery.
- **Just-in-Time Service (JITS):** Adapting JIT methodologies to provide timely and personalized guest services.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines logistics frameworks with guest experience theories, illustrating how operational efficiency can enhance guest satisfaction and sustainability.

# Methodology
## Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of logistics principles into guest experience.

## Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with hospitality professionals and guests.
- Case studies of hospitality establishments implementing logistics-based practices.

## Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between logistics integration and guest satisfaction.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

## Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent, particularly when collecting data from guests and industry professionals.
