# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics Principles to Enhance Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of logistics principles into the hospitality sector, aiming to enhance guest experiences through improved efficiency, real-time data utilization, and sustainable practices. By systematically transposing key logistics concepts to hospitality, this research seeks to create a comprehensive framework for optimizing guest interactions. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering practical applications for industry leaders, policymakers, and educators, ultimately revolutionizing the way hospitality businesses operate.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry is increasingly competitive, necessitating novel approaches to enhance guest experiences.
