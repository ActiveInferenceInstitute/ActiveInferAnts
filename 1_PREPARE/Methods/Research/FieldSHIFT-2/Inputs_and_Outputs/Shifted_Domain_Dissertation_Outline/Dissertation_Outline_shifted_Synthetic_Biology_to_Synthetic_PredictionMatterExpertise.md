# PhD Dissertation Plan: From Ecosystem to Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of ecological principles from the field of ecosystem studies with the predictive frameworks of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). The research will investigate how concepts such as biodiversity, resilience, and information flow in ecosystems can enhance predictive accuracy and adaptability in organizational decision-making. By establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework and empirical methodologies, this dissertation seeks to provide significant contributions to both fields, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation in complex environments.
