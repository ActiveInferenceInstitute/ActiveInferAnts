# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Fabric Arts and Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the fabric industry and arts with non-science ways of knowing. By examining the cultural narratives embedded in textiles and the holistic approaches of non-scientific knowledge, this research will reveal new pathways for understanding creativity, sustainability, and community identity. The study will propose an integrated theoretical model, develop innovative educational practices, and suggest practical applications that can enhance mental health and social cohesion. The findings will contribute to both the fabric arts and non-science knowledge domains, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and societal impact.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has historically been a crucial medium for cultural expression and innovation, while non-science ways of knowing offer alternative perspectives on understanding the world. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains by analyzing their intersections and synergies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional hierarchies of knowledge by advocating for the integration of artistic practices and non-scientific methodologies. The novelty lies in framing textiles as vessels of cultural knowledge, thus expanding the discourse around both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the narratives embedded in textile arts inform non-science ways of knowing?
2. What are the implications of integrating fabric arts into educational and therapeutic practices?
3. How can sustainable practices in the fabric industry contribute to holistic health and community well-being?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the evolution of the fabric industry from artisanal practices to modern industrialization.
- Examination of non-science ways of knowing, including indigenous knowledge systems and holistic approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of contemporary trends in textile arts, focusing on sustainability and technology.
- Overview of the challenges faced by non-scientific knowledge in gaining recognition within academic and professional spheres.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Exploration of opportunities for innovation in education, health, and community development.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Theories of creativity and cultural expression in the fabric industry.
- Holistic health models and indigenous epistemologies in non-science ways of knowing.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Concept of "Fabric Knowledge" as a means of understanding cultural narratives.
- "Artisanal Intuition" as a framework for exploring intuitive knowledge in creative practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that visualizes the interconnections between fabric arts and non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing creativity, sustainability, and cultural identity.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersections of fabric arts and non-science knowledge.

### Data Collection Methods
- Interviews with textile artists and practitioners of non-science knowledge.
- Surveys assessing the impact of textile arts on emotional well-being and community identity.
- Case studies of community fabric projects.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.
- Statistical analysis of survey results to identify correlations between textile arts and community health outcomes.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from all participants.
- Respecting cultural sensitivities and the intellectual property of traditional knowledge systems.
