# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts to William Blake’s Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing the innovative concepts of Buckminster Fuller into the artistic and literary framework of William Blake. By examining the interconnectedness of Fuller's principles—such as holistic thinking, sustainability, tensegrity, and synergetics—with Blake's exploration of dualities and social critique, this research seeks to uncover new insights and applications that bridge the fields of design science and art. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize interdisciplinary studies, fostering a deeper understanding of how creativity can address contemporary societal challenges. Through a comprehensive analysis and innovative methodologies, this dissertation will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications in education and technology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between the realms of design science, as articulated by Buckminster Fuller, and the artistic and literary contributions of William Blake. Fuller’s holistic and systems-oriented approach to problem-solving contrasts with Blake’s focus on the dualities of human experience, spirituality, and social critique. This dissertation will systematically explore the underlying isomorphisms between these two domains, proposing a new framework for understanding their interconnectedness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it merges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on both Fuller’s and Blake’s contributions. By highlighting the synergies between design science and artistic expression, this dissertation will create a novel discourse that challenges traditional interpretations and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings have the potential to influence educational practices, technological innovations, and societal approaches to sustainability and creativity.
