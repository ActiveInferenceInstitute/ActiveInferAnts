# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts to William Blake’s Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s principles of holistic design and sustainability with William Blake’s artistic and poetic vision. By investigating the structural and conceptual interrelations between these two influential figures, the research seeks to establish a new interdisciplinary framework that emphasizes the importance of imagination, creativity, and environmental stewardship. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to inspire novel approaches to sustainability, foster new educational paradigms, and cultivate a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of human experience and the environment.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain arises from the intersection of two distinct fields: the systemic design and sustainability principles espoused by Buckminster Fuller and the imaginative, spiritual, and socially critical works of William Blake. This unique blend provides an opportunity to explore how Fuller’s holistic thinking can recontextualize Blake’s vision in a contemporary setting.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to create a new lexicon and theoretical framework that bridges art, literature, and environmental science. By transposing Fuller’s concepts to Blake’s work, we can uncover new insights into both fields and propose innovative solutions to modern challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s principles of design and sustainability be applied to the interpretation of William Blake’s work?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these two domains?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach inform contemporary practices in art, literature, and environmental stewardship?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Buckminster Fuller:** Overview of Fuller’s life, major works, and the socio-political context of his ideas.
- **William Blake:** Examination of Blake’s biography, key themes in his work, and the historical challenges he faced.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of contemporary interpretations of Fuller’s designs and Blake’s artistry.
- Review of existing interdisciplinary studies that touch on either domain.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that connect artistic expression with sustainability.
- Exploration of the potential for new methodologies that integrate systemic thinking with creative practices.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- Analysis of Blake’s duality of innocence and experience, and his critique of industrialization.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Development of concepts such as "Spaceship Albion" and "Synergetic Imagination."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Introduction of a model that synthesizes Fuller's and Blake’s ideas, emphasizing holistic perspectives and emergent properties in both art and sustainability.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative and quantitative approaches, including case studies, workshops, and artistic collaborations.

### Data Collection Methods
- Interviews with experts in art, literature, and sustainability.
- Surveys to gather insights on public perceptions of Blake's work in relation to environmental issues.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of Blake’s texts and Fuller’s designs.
- Comparative analysis to identify synergies between the two thinkers.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring respectful representation of Blake’s work and Fuller’s principles.
- Engaging with communities in a participatory manner.
