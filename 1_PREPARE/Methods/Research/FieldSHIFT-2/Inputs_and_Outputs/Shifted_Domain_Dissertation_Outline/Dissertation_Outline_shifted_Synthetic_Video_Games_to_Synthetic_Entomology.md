# PhD Dissertation Plan: Game Design Principles Applied to Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of game design and entomology, proposing a transformative framework that utilizes game design principles to enhance public engagement, education, and research in the field of entomology. By integrating interactive experiences, narrative-driven campaigns, and gamified learning modules, the research seeks to address significant challenges in entomology, such as declining insect populations and public awareness. The potential impact of this research extends beyond entomology, offering insights into interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative educational practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of game design and entomology represents a novel approach to understanding and engaging with the complex world of insects. Game design, with its focus on player interaction, engagement, and narrative, provides powerful tools for enhancing the study and appreciation of entomological principles. This dissertation will investigate how these tools can be effectively applied to foster greater understanding and conservation of insect species.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and public engagement. By employing game design methodologies, the dissertation proposes a fresh perspective on entomological education and conservation, making complex ecological concepts more accessible and engaging. The novelty lies in the application of game mechanics to real-world ecological issues, creating a unique interdisciplinary approach.
