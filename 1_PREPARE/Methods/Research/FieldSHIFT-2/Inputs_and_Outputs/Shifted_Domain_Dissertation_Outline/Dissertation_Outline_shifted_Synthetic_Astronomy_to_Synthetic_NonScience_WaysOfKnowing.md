# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Astronomy into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of astronomy and non-science ways of knowing, aiming to create a comprehensive framework that integrates empirical observation with intuitive, narrative, and artistic interpretations of the cosmos. By examining the intersections of these two domains, the research seeks to uncover novel insights into human experience and promote a holistic understanding of knowledge creation. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing educational practices, cultural narratives, and societal values, ultimately fostering a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of all forms of knowledge.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a transformative approach to understanding the universe, merging the empirical rigor of astronomy with the rich, subjective landscapes of non-scientific knowledge systems. This interdisciplinary exploration acknowledges that both domains offer valuable insights into existence and our place within the cosmos.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between science and non-science, advocating for an integrated approach that values diverse epistemologies. The novelty lies in the development of new theoretical constructs and methodologies that bridge these domains, fostering an enriched understanding of both.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can astronomical concepts be reframed within non-scientific narratives?
- In what ways do intuitive and artistic interpretations of the cosmos complement empirical observations in astronomy?
- What are the implications of this integration for education, community engagement, and cultural identity?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Trace the evolution of astronomy from ancient civilizations to modern astrophysics.
- Examine the philosophical underpinnings of non-scientific ways of knowing, including indigenous knowledge systems and artistic expressions.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review recent advancements in astronomy, such as discoveries related to dark matter and exoplanets.
- Explore contemporary movements in non-science ways of knowing, including the resurgence of indigenous knowledge and the role of art in understanding complex realities.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identify the lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate empirical and non-empirical approaches.
- Highlight opportunities for innovative research that enriches both fields and addresses global challenges.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Discuss key astronomical theories (e.g., the Big Bang, relativity) and their implications for understanding cosmic phenomena.
- Explore philosophical theories related to non-scientific ways of knowing, such as constructivism and interpretivism.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Propose new constructs that emerge from the integration of astronomy and non-science, such as "Cosmic Narratives" and "Intuitive Cosmology."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Develop an integrated model that illustrates the interplay between empirical observation and subjective interpretation in understanding the universe.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- Outline a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research techniques to explore the Shifted Domain.

### Data Collection Methods
- Conduct surveys and interviews with individuals engaged in both astronomy and non-scientific practices.
- Analyze community narratives that incorporate cosmic events.

### Analytical Approaches
- Use thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical methods for quantitative data.
- Employ case studies to illustrate successful integrations of both domains.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensure ethical research practices by obtaining informed consent and respecting cultural sensitivities, particularly regarding indigenous knowledge systems.
