# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing RxInfer.jl (Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference) into the Context of Biology and Ecosystems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking integration of RxInfer.jl, a probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference framework, into the study of biology and ecosystems. By leveraging the principles of probabilistic modeling, this research aims to develop novel ecological models that account for uncertainty and complexity in species interactions and environmental dynamics. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of ecosystem resilience, biodiversity, and the impacts of climate change. This interdisciplinary approach not only advances ecological theory but also has practical applications in conservation and environmental policy.
