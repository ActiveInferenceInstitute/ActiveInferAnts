## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy and modern urban planning, addressing the urgent need for innovative solutions to urban challenges. Fuller's concepts, including tensegrity, synergetics, and ephemeralization, provide a rich theoretical foundation for rethinking urban design and resource management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on urban planning that emphasizes systems thinking and sustainability. The novelty lies in the application of Fuller's principles to contemporary urban issues, creating a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that can guide future urban development.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Buckminster Fuller’s design principles be systematically integrated into urban planning practices?
- What are the implications of applying these principles for sustainability, community engagement, and resource management in urban environments?
