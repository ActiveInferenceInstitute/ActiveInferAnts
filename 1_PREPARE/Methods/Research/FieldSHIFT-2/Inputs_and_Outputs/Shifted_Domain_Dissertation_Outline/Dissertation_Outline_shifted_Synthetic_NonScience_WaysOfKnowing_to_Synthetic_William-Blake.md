# PhD Dissertation Plan: Reimagining William Blake through Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing with the life and work of William Blake. By examining Blake's art and poetry through lenses such as intuition, emotion, and experiential learning, this research seeks to uncover deeper insights into his contributions to literature and philosophy. The significance of this study lies in its potential to enrich both literary scholarship and the understanding of human experience, offering a holistic framework that bridges rational analysis and spiritual exploration. The outcomes of this research could lead to innovative educational practices, interdisciplinary collaborations, and new methodologies for engaging with artistic works.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of non-science ways of knowing—such as intuition, tradition, and artistic expression—with the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in the Romantic movement. This intersection allows for a reevaluation of Blake’s contributions beyond traditional literary analysis, embracing a broader understanding of knowledge that includes subjective experiences and emotional engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional boundaries of literary studies, proposing that a more holistic approach can yield richer interpretations of Blake's work. By integrating non-science ways of knowing, the study highlights the relevance of spirituality, emotion, and personal experience in understanding artistic expression. This novel perspective offers a fresh lens through which to engage with Blake's themes of imagination, contraries, and the human condition.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing enhance our understanding of William Blake's life and work?
- In what ways do Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions resonate with contemporary non-scientific knowledge systems?
