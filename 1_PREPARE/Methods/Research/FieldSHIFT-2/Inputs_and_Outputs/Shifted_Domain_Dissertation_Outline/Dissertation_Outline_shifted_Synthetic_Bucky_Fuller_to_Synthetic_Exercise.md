# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts to the Field of Exercise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Buckminster Fuller’s innovative concepts into the field of exercise. By examining the intersections between Fuller's principles—such as holistic thinking, ephemeralization, and tensegrity—and contemporary exercise paradigms, this research seeks to develop a new framework for understanding physical fitness that emphasizes community engagement, efficiency, and overall well-being. The findings are expected to have significant implications for public health, educational practices, and community initiatives, ultimately contributing to a healthier, more cohesive society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophies with exercise science represents a groundbreaking shift in how we conceptualize health and fitness. Fuller’s holistic approach underscores the interconnectedness of systems, paralleling the need for a comprehensive understanding of physical health that incorporates mental and social dimensions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it challenges traditional paradigms in exercise science, which often focus on individual performance and isolated health outcomes. By applying Fuller's principles, we can create a more inclusive and effective model that prioritizes community health and sustainable practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Fuller’s principles be effectively transposed into exercise paradigms to enhance community health?
- What are the potential benefits of a community-oriented approach to exercise on mental and physical well-being?
- How can innovative design principles improve the efficacy and accessibility of exercise programs?
