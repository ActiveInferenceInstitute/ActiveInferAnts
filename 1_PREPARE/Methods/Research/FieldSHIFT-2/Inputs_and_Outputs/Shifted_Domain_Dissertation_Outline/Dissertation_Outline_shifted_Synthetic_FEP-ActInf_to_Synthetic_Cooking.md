# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying the Free Energy Principle to Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative application of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to the culinary arts, proposing a systematic framework that integrates concepts from cognitive science and gastronomy. By examining the predictive coding, active inference, and generative models inherent in both domains, this research seeks to uncover new methodologies for culinary innovation and education. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize culinary practices, enhance flavor development, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately impacting both the culinary field and cognitive sciences.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. Cuisine, as a cultural and artistic practice, embodies similar principles in its pursuit of flavor harmony and innovation. This dissertation investigates the parallels between these two domains, highlighting how insights from FEP can enhance culinary practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research presents a novel perspective by merging cognitive science with culinary arts, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding flavor development, recipe innovation, and culinary education. The implications extend beyond gastronomy, offering insights into human cognition and adaptive systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of predictive coding and active inference be applied to flavor development in culinary practices?
2. In what ways can generative models inform the evolution of cuisines and culinary fusion?
3. What educational frameworks can be developed to integrate FEP concepts into culinary training?
