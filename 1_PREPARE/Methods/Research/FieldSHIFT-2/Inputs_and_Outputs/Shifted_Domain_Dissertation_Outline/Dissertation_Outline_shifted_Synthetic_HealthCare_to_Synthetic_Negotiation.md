# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Negotiation through Healthcare Principles

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of healthcare principles with negotiation strategies, creating a new interdisciplinary framework termed "Patient-Centric Negotiation." By integrating patient-centered care, service quality, and technology from healthcare into negotiation practices, this research seeks to enhance negotiation outcomes, improve stakeholder relationships, and promote sustainable agreements. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation education, practices, and technologies, offering practical applications across various industries. The findings are expected to create pathways for future research, policy implications, and societal benefits.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between healthcare and negotiation, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. However, both domains share core principles such as stakeholder engagement, quality outcomes, and the importance of communication. This dissertation will investigate how healthcare's patient-centered approach can inform and improve negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which challenges conventional views of negotiation as purely competitive. By applying healthcare principles, this study aims to promote empathy, active listening, and collaboration in negotiations, leading to better outcomes for all parties involved.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can healthcare principles enhance negotiation practices?
2. What are the key isomorphisms between patient-centered care and negotiation strategies?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these domains?
4. How can technology be leveraged to improve negotiation outcomes?
