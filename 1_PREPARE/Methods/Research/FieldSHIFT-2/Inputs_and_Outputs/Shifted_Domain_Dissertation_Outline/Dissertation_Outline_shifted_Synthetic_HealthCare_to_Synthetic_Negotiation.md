# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles to Revolutionize Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking integration of health care principles into negotiation practices, creating a novel Shifted Domain that emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and holistic approaches. By examining the core tenets of patient-centered care and their applicability to negotiation, this research aims to redefine success in negotiations as fostering sustainable relationships rather than merely achieving transactional outcomes. The dissertation will explore theoretical frameworks, empirical studies, and practical applications, ultimately providing a roadmap for practitioners and scholars in both fields. The anticipated impact extends to improved negotiation outcomes, enhanced relationship management, and the potential for interdisciplinary innovations.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of health care and negotiation represents a paradigm shift, where principles traditionally associated with patient care are applied to negotiation contexts. This shift is driven by an increasing recognition of the importance of relationships and emotional intelligence in achieving successful outcomes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it offers a fresh perspective on negotiation strategies, moving away from adversarial tactics towards a more collaborative and empathetic approach. It is novel in its application of health care methodologies—such as shared decision-making and continuity of care—within negotiation frameworks, providing a unique lens through which to analyze and improve negotiation practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of patient-centered care enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What are the theoretical underpinnings of empathetic negotiation?
3. In what ways can the integration of health care principles transform negotiation outcomes and relationships?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Health Care:** The evolution from provider-centric to patient-centered care, highlighting the importance of emotional and psychological factors.
- **Negotiation:** The transition from adversarial negotiation tactics to collaborative approaches, with a focus on relationship-building.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Health Care:** Emphasis on service quality, technology integration, and holistic care.
- **Negotiation:** Dominance of competitive strategies and the need for innovative, empathetic approaches.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There is a lack of research exploring the intersection of health care principles and negotiation practices. This presents an opportunity to fill a significant gap by developing a comprehensive framework that integrates insights from both fields.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Patient-Centered Care Theory:** Emphasizing the role of patient engagement and satisfaction.
- **Collaborative Negotiation Theory:** Focusing on mutual gains and relationship maintenance.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Empathetic Negotiation Theory:** Proposing that empathy in negotiation leads to better outcomes.
- **Patient-Centered Negotiation Model:** Integrating health care principles into negotiation frameworks.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model that combines the principles of patient-centered care with negotiation strategies, focusing on empathy, active listening, and relationship maintenance.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of health care principles into negotiation practices.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiation professionals and healthcare providers.
- Case studies of successful negotiations employing patient-centered approaches.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring confidentiality and informed consent for all participants, as well as addressing any potential biases in the research.
