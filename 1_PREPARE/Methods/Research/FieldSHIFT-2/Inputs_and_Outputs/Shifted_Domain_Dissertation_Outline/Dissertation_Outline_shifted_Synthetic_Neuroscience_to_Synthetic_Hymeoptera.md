# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into the Context of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and the study of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps). By investigating the parallels between neural networks and ant colony structures, the research seeks to develop a new theoretical framework that redefines our understanding of collective behavior and intelligence in social insects. The findings will have significant implications for both fields, potentially leading to advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and environmental management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of neuroscience with Hymenoptera studies represents a novel approach to understanding complex systems. Neuroscience provides insights into information processing, adaptability, and communication within neural networks, while Hymenoptera exhibits sophisticated social behaviors and collective intelligence.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on collective behavior. By applying concepts from neuroscience to social insects, we can uncover new mechanisms of communication and decision-making that challenge traditional views of intelligence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can neural network principles inform our understanding of ant colony architecture and behavior?
2. In what ways do pheromonal communications in Hymenoptera mirror neurotransmitter functions in neural circuits?
3. What new theoretical constructs can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
