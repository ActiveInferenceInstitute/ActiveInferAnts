# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience Principles into the Study of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles of neuroscience with the study of Hymenoptera, specifically ants, bees, and wasps. By framing social insect behavior through the lens of neural mechanisms, this research seeks to uncover new insights into collective intelligence, decision-making, and communication strategies within these complex societies. The significance of this work lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which not only enriches our understanding of Hymenoptera but also offers innovative applications in ecology, technology, and education.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of neuroscience and entomology represents a novel interdisciplinary domain that leverages insights from neural mechanisms to better understand the intricate behaviors of social insects. Hymenoptera, known for their complex social structures and adaptive behaviors, provide a unique context for this exploration.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes a new theoretical framework that bridges two previously distinct fields, offering fresh perspectives on social insect behavior. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of neural principles to explain and predict behaviors in ant colonies, bee societies, and wasp communities.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of neural networks be applied to understand the collective behaviors of ant colonies?
2. In what ways do chemical communication and pheromone signaling resemble neurotransmission in neural circuits?
3. What insights can be gained from studying the adaptability of Hymenoptera behaviors through the lens of synaptic plasticity?
