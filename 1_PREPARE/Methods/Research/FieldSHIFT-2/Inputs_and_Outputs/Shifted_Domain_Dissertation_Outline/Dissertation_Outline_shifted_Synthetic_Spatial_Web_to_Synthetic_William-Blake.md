# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Spatial Web into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the Spatial Web and the life and work of William Blake, examining how contemporary technologies can enhance understanding and engagement with Blake's art and poetry. By integrating augmented reality, digital twins, and geospatial mapping with Blake's visionary perspectives, this research seeks to create new methodologies for experiencing art and literature. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize educational practices, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and redefine how we perceive the interconnectedness of art and technology. The findings are expected to have profound implications for both the fields of digital technology and literary studies, ultimately contributing to a richer cultural discourse.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift in how we interact with our environment, merging physical and digital realms to create immersive experiences. In contrast, William Blake's work embodies a deep exploration of human experience, spirituality, and artistic expression. This dissertation will investigate the synergies between these two domains, focusing on how Blake's visionary art can be reinterpreted through the lens of contemporary technology.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields—digital technology and Romantic literature—creating a new interdisciplinary framework. The novelty lies in applying Spatial Web technologies to enhance the understanding of Blake's work, providing fresh insights into his artistic vision and its relevance in today's digital age.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can augmented reality and other Spatial Web technologies be utilized to enhance the engagement and interpretation of William Blake's works?
2. What new insights can be gained from applying geospatial mapping to Blake's life and artistic development?
3. How does the integration of digital technologies influence our understanding of the interconnectedness present in Blake's work?
