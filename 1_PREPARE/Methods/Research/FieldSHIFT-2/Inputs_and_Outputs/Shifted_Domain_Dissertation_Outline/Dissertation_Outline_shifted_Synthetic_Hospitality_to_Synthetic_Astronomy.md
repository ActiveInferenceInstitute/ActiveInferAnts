# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience into Astronomy: A Transformative Framework

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and the field of astronomy, creating a transformative framework that enhances public engagement, scientific literacy, and the overall experience of interacting with astronomical phenomena. By leveraging methodologies from guest experience, such as personalization, service quality, and technology integration, this research will propose a new paradigm for how astronomy can engage the public and foster a deeper understanding of the universe. The potential impact of this work extends beyond astronomy; it may influence interdisciplinary collaboration and reshape how scientific fields communicate with the public.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on creating memorable interactions through personalization, service quality, and technology integration. Conversely, astronomy has primarily concentrated on scientific inquiry and data analysis, often neglecting direct public engagement. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, applying principles of guest experience to enhance the way individuals interact with and understand astronomy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel framework that reimagines the public's experience of astronomy through the lens of guest experience. It offers fresh insights into how astronomy can become more accessible and engaging, ultimately fostering a culture of scientific inquiry and appreciation. The novelty lies in the application of hospitality principles to a scientific discipline, creating new pathways for engagement and education.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience enhance public engagement in astronomy?
2. What frameworks can be developed to personalize and co-create astronomical experiences for diverse audiences?
3. In what ways can technology be integrated into astronomy outreach to improve accessibility and understanding?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The guest experience has evolved from basic service provision to a comprehensive approach that incorporates personalization and technology. In contrast, astronomy has transitioned from observational techniques to advanced data analysis, with a growing emphasis on public engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature highlights the importance of personalization and service quality in hospitality, while astronomy literature emphasizes the need for improved public communication and engagement strategies. However, there is limited exploration of the intersection between these fields.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The literature reveals a gap in the application of guest experience principles to astronomy, presenting an opportunity to enhance public engagement and understanding. This research aims to fill that gap by proposing a transformative framework.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service-Dominant Logic**: Focuses on value co-creation in service industries.
- **Experiential Learning Theory**: Emphasizes learning through experience and reflection.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Astronomer Experience**: A new construct that encapsulates the holistic journey of researchers, students, and the public in engaging with astronomy.
- **Personalized Learning in Astronomy**: Tailoring educational experiences based on individual interests and backgrounds.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model will be developed to illustrate the relationship between guest experience principles and public engagement in astronomy, highlighting key components such as personalization, co-creation, and technology integration.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to gather comprehensive data on public engagement in astronomy.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys**: To assess public interest and understanding of astronomical concepts.
- **Interviews**: With astronomers and educators to explore current engagement practices.
- **Case Studies**: Of successful public engagement initiatives in both hospitality and astronomy.

### Analytical Approaches
Data will be analyzed using statistical techniques for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the research questions.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will include informed consent, data privacy, and the responsible use of public feedback in citizen science initiatives.
