# PhD Dissertation Plan: "Transacting the Imagination: An Interdisciplinary Exploration of ATM Transactions and William Blake's Life and Work"

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of ATM transactions and the life and work of William Blake, reimagining Blake’s artistic and philosophical contributions through the lens of transactional processes, user experience, and network interactions. By developing a transformative framework that integrates principles from both domains, this research will uncover new insights into Blake's work while providing valuable implications for user experience design in the arts. This interdisciplinary approach not only revitalizes Blake's contributions but also enriches our understanding of how art can serve as a portal for emotional and spiritual exploration, inviting readers to engage deeply with the dualities of human experience.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of ATM transactions and William Blake's artistic philosophy represents a novel interdisciplinary field that examines how transactional experiences can inform the interpretation of art and literature. This fusion allows for a deeper understanding of user engagement, accessibility, and the integrity of expression in both financial and artistic contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the humanities and technology, offering a fresh perspective on Blake’s work while introducing innovative frameworks for user experience design in the arts. The novelty lies in applying transactional principles to literary analysis and artistic expression, creating a dialogue between seemingly disparate fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Blake’s works function as self-service portals for emotional and spiritual inquiry?
- In what ways can the transaction flow in Blake’s poetry be mapped to user experience design principles?
- What are the implications of viewing Blake’s artistic integrity as a form of security protocol in creative expression?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the development of ATM technology and its impact on banking and user experience.
- Examination of William Blake’s life, artistic philosophy, and the historical context of his work.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of existing literature on ATM transactions, user experience design, and security protocols.
- Review of scholarly interpretations of Blake’s poetry, art, and philosophical contributions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Interactivity in Art: The role of audience engagement in the interpretation of artistic works.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that maps transactional principles onto Blake’s poetic structures and themes.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative research design incorporating textual analysis, user experience evaluation, and case studies.

### Data Collection Methods
- Analysis of Blake’s texts and artworks.
- Surveys and interviews with audiences engaging with Blake’s work.
- Case studies of user experience design in digital art platforms.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of Blake’s poetry and art.
- Comparative analysis of ATM transaction flows and poetic structures.
- User experience evaluation metrics.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring the integrity of artistic interpretations and respecting the original context of Blake’s work.
- Addressing privacy concerns in user experience research.
