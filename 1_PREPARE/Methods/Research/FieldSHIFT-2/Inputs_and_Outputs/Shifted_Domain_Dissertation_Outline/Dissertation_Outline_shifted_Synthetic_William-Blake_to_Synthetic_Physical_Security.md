# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions with the practical field of physical security. By examining Blake’s concepts of imagination, duality, spirituality, and social critique, this research aims to develop a new paradigm for understanding and implementing physical security measures. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform traditional security practices into more holistic, community-oriented, and ethically sound approaches, thereby enhancing safety and fostering a deeper connection between individuals and their environments.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's life and work with physical security represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that draws from literature, art, philosophy, and security studies. This shift challenges conventional perceptions of security as merely a reactive measure against threats, advocating for a proactive and imaginative framework that prioritizes human factors and community engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it bridges two previously distinct fields, opening new avenues for understanding the complexities of security in a modern context. By integrating Blake's visionary insights, the dissertation offers innovative solutions that address both the physical and psychological dimensions of security.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake’s philosophies inform the design and implementation of physical security measures?
2. What are the implications of integrating imaginative and artistic elements into security practices?
3. How can community engagement be enhanced through the application of Blake’s concepts?
