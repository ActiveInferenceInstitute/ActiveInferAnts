# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation Concepts into Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and culinary practices, termed "Culinary Negotiation." By analyzing how negotiation strategies can enhance flavor pairing, ingredient selection, and cultural exchange in cuisine, this research seeks to establish a new theoretical framework that enriches both culinary arts and negotiation studies. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, promising to influence culinary education, industry practices, and cultural understanding, fostering a more inclusive and innovative culinary landscape.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of negotiation concepts and culinary arts, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Negotiation involves dialogue aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements, while cuisine encompasses the cultural and technical aspects of food preparation and presentation. This dissertation explores how the principles of negotiation can be applied to culinary practices, creating a new paradigm for chefs and food enthusiasts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms in both negotiation and culinary studies by proposing that cooking can be viewed as a negotiation process. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of negotiation strategies into culinary practices, offering fresh insights into flavor creation, cultural influences, and the collaborative nature of cooking.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be applied to enhance culinary practices?
2. What are the cultural implications of integrating negotiation strategies into cuisine?
3. How does the concept of "Culinary Negotiation" influence flavor pairing and ingredient selection?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation:** Review the evolution of negotiation theories, from distributive bargaining to integrative negotiation, highlighting key scholars and their contributions.
- **Cuisine:** Trace the historical development of culinary arts, emphasizing cultural influences and technological advancements.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Negotiation:** Summarize contemporary negotiation research, focusing on cultural dimensions and ethical considerations.
- **Cuisine:** Discuss current culinary trends, challenges, and innovations, particularly in the context of globalization and sustainability.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identify gaps in existing literature where negotiation concepts have not been applied to culinary practices, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary research that bridges these fields.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Negotiation Theories:** Explore key theories such as the Harvard Negotiation Project and interest-based negotiation.
- **Culinary Theories:** Discuss theories related to flavor pairing, culinary traditions, and cultural gastronomy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
Introduce the concept of "Flavor Negotiation Theory," which posits that the culinary process mirrors negotiation dynamics, requiring balance and compromise among competing flavors.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
Develop a model that illustrates the interplay between negotiation strategies and culinary practices, emphasizing the role of cultural influences and collaborative cooking.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
Adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with chefs and quantitative analysis of culinary outcomes based on negotiation principles.

### Data Collection Methods
- Conduct interviews with professional chefs to gather insights on their experiences with flavor negotiation.
- Use surveys to assess the impact of negotiation training on culinary students' recipe development.

### Analytical Approaches
- Employ thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical methods for quantitative data to identify patterns and correlations.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure informed consent from participants, maintain confidentiality, and address any potential biases in data interpretation.
