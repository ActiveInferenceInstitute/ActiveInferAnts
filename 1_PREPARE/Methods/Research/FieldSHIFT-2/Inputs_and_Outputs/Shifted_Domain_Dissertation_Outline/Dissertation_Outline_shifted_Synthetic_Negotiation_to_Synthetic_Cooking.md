# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain arises from the intersection of negotiation, a field rooted in communication and agreement, and cuisine, characterized by its rich cultural heritage and evolving practices. As globalization and technological advancements reshape both domains, there is a pressing need to understand and leverage the synergies between them. This dissertation posits that viewing culinary practices through the lens of negotiation can yield new insights and methodologies for chefs and culinary educators alike.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it introduces a novel framework for understanding the collaborative and communicative aspects of cooking. By applying negotiation principles to culinary practices, we can challenge traditional views of cooking as a solitary endeavor and highlight the importance of dialogue and flexibility in creating exceptional culinary experiences. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the culinary arts but also provides valuable insights into negotiation as a skill set applicable beyond its conventional boundaries.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can negotiation principles enhance collaboration in culinary practices?
2. What impact does effective ingredient negotiation have on dish quality and diner satisfaction?
3. In what ways can culinary education integrate negotiation skills to prepare future chefs for collaborative cooking environments?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Negotiation
The evolution of negotiation from informal discussions to structured methodologies has been shaped by cultural influences, technological advancements, and the increasing complexity of global interactions. Key milestones include the development of integrative negotiation strategies and the emphasis on emotional intelligence.

### Cuisine
Culinary practices have historically been influenced by trade, colonization, and cultural exchange, leading to diverse and rich culinary traditions. Modern culinary trends reflect the interplay of globalization, sustainability, and health consciousness.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Negotiation
Current research highlights the importance of emotional intelligence, cultural sensitivity, and the role of technology in negotiation processes. However, there is a lack of exploration into how these principles can be applied in non-traditional contexts, such as cuisine.

### Cuisine
The culinary field is increasingly focused on sustainability, innovation, and the integration of technology. Despite this, there is limited research on the collaborative aspects of cooking and how negotiation can enhance these processes.
