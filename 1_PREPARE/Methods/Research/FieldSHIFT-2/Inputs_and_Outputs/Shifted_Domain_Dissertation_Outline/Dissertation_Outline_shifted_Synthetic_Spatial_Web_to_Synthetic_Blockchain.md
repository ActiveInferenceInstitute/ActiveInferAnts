# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of the Spatial Web and Blockchain represents a groundbreaking shift in how we perceive and interact with our environments. The Spatial Web integrates physical and digital realms through immersive technologies, while Blockchain provides a decentralized framework for secure data transactions. This dissertation will investigate the intersection of these two domains, focusing on their potential to create a more interconnected and user-centric experience.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for secure, transparent interactions in the increasingly digital landscape. By merging the Spatial Web's immersive capabilities with Blockchain's decentralized nature, we can create innovative solutions that enhance trust and user engagement. The novelty lies in the systematic exploration of this integration, which has not been extensively studied in existing literature.
