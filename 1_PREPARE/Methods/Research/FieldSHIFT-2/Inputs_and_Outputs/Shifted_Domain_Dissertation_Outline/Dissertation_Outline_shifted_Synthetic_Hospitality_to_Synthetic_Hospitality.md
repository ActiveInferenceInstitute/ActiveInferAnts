### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between theoretical principles of guest experience and practical applications in hospitality management. It introduces a novel framework that prioritizes guest journey management, personalization, sustainability, and employee engagement, offering a fresh perspective on enhancing guest satisfaction and operational success.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can a holistic guest experience management framework be effectively integrated into hospitality management practices?
2. What role does data-driven personalization play in enhancing guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can sustainable practices be embedded into operational strategies without compromising efficiency?
4. What is the impact of employee empowerment on guest experience and satisfaction?
