# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Education

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing guest experience principles from the hospitality industry to the field of education. By integrating methodologies, theories, and practices from hospitality into educational frameworks, this research seeks to enhance student engagement, satisfaction, and learning outcomes. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize educational practices, creating personalized and meaningful learning experiences that cater to diverse student needs. The findings could have profound implications for both the education sector and the hospitality industry, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The guest experience in hospitality has evolved to focus on personalization, service quality, and emotional connections, while education has traditionally emphasized standardized knowledge transfer. As both fields increasingly recognize the importance of individual experiences, there is an opportunity to merge these domains, creating a new paradigm for educational practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to apply established hospitality principles to education, creating a framework that prioritizes the learner's journey. By doing so, it addresses critical challenges in education, such as student engagement and personalized learning, while also contributing to the broader discourse on interdisciplinary innovation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can guest experience principles from hospitality be effectively integrated into educational frameworks?
2. What are the impacts of personalized learning experiences on student engagement and academic outcomes?
3. How does technology enhance the learning experience in ways analogous to its use in hospitality?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Hospitality:** The evolution from basic service provision to a focus on holistic guest experiences.
- **Education:** The transition from rote learning to a growing emphasis on personalized and experiential learning.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Hospitality:** Emphasis on service quality, emotional connections, and technology integration.
- **Education:** Recognition of diverse learning needs and the importance of student engagement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of research on the application of hospitality principles in education.
- Opportunities for innovative practices that enhance student experiences and outcomes.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **SERVQUAL Model:** A framework for measuring service quality.
- **Experiential Learning Theory:** Learning as a process where knowledge is created through the transformation of experience.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Learner Experience (LX) Framework:** A model that encompasses all interactions a student has with an educational institution.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a comprehensive model that combines elements of guest experience and learner experience, focusing on personalization, engagement, and feedback.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be utilized, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of guest experience principles into educational practices.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** To gather quantitative data on student engagement and satisfaction.
- **Interviews:** To collect qualitative insights from educators and students about their experiences.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data.
- Thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify key themes and insights.

### Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent from participants.
- Anonymity and confidentiality in data collection and reporting.
