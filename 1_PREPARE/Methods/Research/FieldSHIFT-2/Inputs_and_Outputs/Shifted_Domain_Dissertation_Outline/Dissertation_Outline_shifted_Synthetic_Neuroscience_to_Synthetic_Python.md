# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Neuroscience

Neuroscience has evolved from early anatomical studies of the brain to a multidisciplinary field encompassing cognitive psychology, molecular biology, and computational neuroscience. Key milestones include the discovery of synaptic plasticity and advances in neuroimaging techniques.

### Python Programming

Python emerged in the late 1980s and has grown to become one of the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity and versatility. Key developments include the rise of libraries and frameworks that facilitate data science and machine learning.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Neuroscience

Current research emphasizes brain plasticity, neural networks, and the integration of computational models to simulate cognitive processes.

### Python Programming

Python is widely used in AI, data science, and web development, with ongoing discussions about performance optimization and effective coding practices.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there is a lack of interdisciplinary dialogue that explores how principles from neuroscience can enhance programming practices. This research aims to fill that gap by proposing a framework for integrating these domains.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Neuroscience

- **Hebbian Learning:** "Cells that fire together, wire together," emphasizing the importance of synaptic connections in learning.
- **Neural Plasticity:** The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections.

### Python Programming

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data and behaviors.
- **Dynamic Typing:** A feature that allows variable types to change at runtime, promoting flexibility.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Neural Functions:** Functions that adapt their behavior based on historical usage patterns, inspired by synaptic plasticity.
- **Adaptive Code Structures:** Code that evolves over time, similar to neurogenesis in biological systems.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that maps neural processes onto programming concepts, illustrating how adaptability and learning can be implemented in code design.

# Methodology
