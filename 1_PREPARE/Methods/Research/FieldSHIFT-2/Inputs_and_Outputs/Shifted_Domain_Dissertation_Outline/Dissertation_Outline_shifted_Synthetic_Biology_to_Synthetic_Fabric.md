# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Ecosystem Concepts into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of ecosystem principles into the fabric industry and arts, creating a transformative framework that promotes sustainability, resilience, and creativity. By analyzing the interconnectedness of stakeholders, the diversity of textile practices, and the resource management strategies inherent in ecosystems, this research will contribute to a more sustainable fabric industry. The findings will have significant implications for ecological practices, industry standards, and cultural expressions, ultimately fostering a vibrant and sustainable textile ecosystem.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of ecosystem science with the fabric industry and arts represents an unprecedented opportunity to rethink production and design practices. Ecosystems are characterized by complex interactions among living organisms and their environments, while the fabric industry faces challenges related to sustainability and ethical production. This dissertation will investigate how principles from ecosystems can inform and enhance practices within the fabric industry.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in the fabric industry by applying ecological principles. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecosystem concepts to create a new theoretical framework—Textile Ecosystems—that highlights the interdependence of stakeholders and the importance of diversity in promoting resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can ecosystem principles be applied to enhance sustainability in the fabric industry?
- What role does diversity play in the resilience of textile practices?
- How can the relationships among stakeholders in the fabric industry be understood through the lens of ecosystem dynamics?
- Objectives:
  - Develop a theoretical model of Textile Ecosystems.
  - Investigate consumer behavior towards sustainable fabrics.
  - Identify influential designers and their impact on industry practices.
