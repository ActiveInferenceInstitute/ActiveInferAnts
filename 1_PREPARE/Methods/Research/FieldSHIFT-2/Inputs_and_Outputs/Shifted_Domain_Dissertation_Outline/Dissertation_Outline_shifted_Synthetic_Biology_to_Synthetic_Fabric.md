# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Applying Biological Ecosystem Principles to the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of biological ecosystem principles with the fabric industry and arts, proposing a new framework for sustainability and creativity. By applying core ecological concepts such as interconnectedness, diversity, energy flow, resilience, and keystone species to the fabric industry, this research seeks to establish a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices that enhance both environmental stewardship and artistic expression. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize textile production and consumption, offering practical applications that can lead to substantial ecological and societal impact.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long operated under a linear model characterized by mass production and consumption, leading to environmental degradation and waste. Meanwhile, biological ecosystems thrive on principles that promote sustainability and resilience. This dissertation will investigate how these ecological principles can be transposed into the fabric industry to create a more sustainable and interconnected system.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only addresses the pressing challenges of sustainability in the fabric industry but also introduces a novel interdisciplinary approach that integrates ecological concepts into industrial practices. By bridging the gap between biology and textile arts, this dissertation offers a fresh perspective that can inspire new methods of production, design, and consumer engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of biological ecosystems inform sustainable practices in the fabric industry?
- What are the potential impacts of implementing ecological frameworks on the production and consumption of textiles?
- How can the fabric industry leverage diversity and resilience to adapt to environmental challenges?
