# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with non-science ways of knowing. By establishing a comprehensive framework that bridges empirical scientific methodologies with holistic, intuitive, and culturally-based understandings, this research seeks to illuminate the transformative potential of this Shifted Domain. The significance of this work lies in its ability to foster interdisciplinary dialogue, enhance decision-making processes, and ultimately contribute to more resilient and adaptive communities. The anticipated impact includes the development of new educational paradigms, technological innovations, and practical applications for policy-making and societal engagement.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle, rooted in cognitive science and neuroscience, posits that living organisms strive to minimize surprise and maintain homeostasis through predictive coding. In contrast, non-science ways of knowing emphasize intuition, tradition, and subjective experiences, often overlooked in empirical research. This dissertation seeks to explore the synergies between these domains, proposing a new paradigm for understanding knowledge acquisition and decision-making.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of FEP and non-science ways of knowing represents a novel approach to understanding human behavior and cognition. This research holds the potential to redefine educational frameworks, enhance community resilience, and promote inclusivity in knowledge creation. By recognizing the validity of diverse epistemologies, this dissertation aims to challenge traditional scientific hierarchies and advocate for a more holistic understanding of complex systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of FEP and Active Inference be adapted to encompass non-scientific ways of knowing?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration, and how can they be empirically tested?
- In what ways can this shifted domain inform educational practices, policy-making, and societal engagement?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The Free Energy Principle has evolved through interdisciplinary research, drawing from statistical mechanics, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Non-science ways of knowing have deep historical roots in indigenous knowledge systems, philosophy, and cultural practices, yet they remain underrepresented in contemporary academic discourse.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in FEP emphasizes predictive coding and adaptive learning, while studies on non-science ways of knowing highlight the importance of cultural narratives and intuition. However, there is a lack of systematic frameworks that integrate these perspectives.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of FEP and non-science ways of knowing presents a unique opportunity to address existing gaps in understanding adaptive systems. By exploring the isomorphisms between these domains, this research can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of knowledge acquisition and decision-making processes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Free Energy Principle**: Theoretical underpinnings of variational free energy and its implications for adaptive behavior.
- **Active Inference**: The role of action in confirming predictions and minimizing uncertainty.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Holistic Free Energy Principle**: A reimagined framework that incorporates emotional and cultural dimensions into the FEP.
- **Cultural Generative Models**: Frameworks representing collective cultural knowledge and practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines FEP, Active Inference, and non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing the interconnectedness of empirical and experiential knowledge.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of FEP and non-science ways of knowing.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys and Questionnaires**: To gather quantitative data on individuals' decision-making processes and cultural narratives.
- **Interviews and Focus Groups**: To collect qualitative insights into personal experiences and intuitive knowledge.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis**: To identify patterns and correlations in quantitative data.
- **Thematic Analysis**: To analyze qualitative data and extract key themes related to knowledge integration.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure informed consent, confidentiality, and respect for cultural knowledge systems throughout the research process.
