# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into the Context of RxInfer.jl

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference into the probabilistic programming framework of RxInfer.jl. By merging insights from cognitive science with advanced probabilistic modeling, this research seeks to develop adaptive generative models that dynamically respond to environmental changes, thereby enhancing inference processes. The significance of this research lies in its ability to bridge two previously distinct domains, offering innovative solutions to challenges in machine learning and cognitive modeling. The anticipated impact includes advancing theoretical frameworks, improving practical applications in AI, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept rooted in statistical physics and cognitive science. RxInfer.jl, on the other hand, is a cutting-edge Julia package that facilitates complex probabilistic modeling through Bayesian inference. This dissertation will investigate the synergies between these two domains, focusing on how the principles of FEP can enhance the capabilities of RxInfer.jl.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to integrate biological principles of learning and adaptation into probabilistic modeling. By applying concepts from the FEP, this dissertation will redefine how inference is understood and implemented within RxInfer.jl, leading to the development of more robust and interpretable models.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
