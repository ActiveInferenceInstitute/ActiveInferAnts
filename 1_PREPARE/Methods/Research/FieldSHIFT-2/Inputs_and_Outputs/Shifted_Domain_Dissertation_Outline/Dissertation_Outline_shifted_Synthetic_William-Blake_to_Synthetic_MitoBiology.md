# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: William Blake’s Visionary Paradigm Applied to Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's visionary framework with mitochondrial biology, creating a Shifted Domain that reveals new insights into cellular processes and human experience. By integrating Blake's concepts of imagination, duality, and spirituality with the biological functions of mitochondria, this research seeks to establish a novel theoretical model that enriches both fields. The potential impact includes advancing mitochondrial research, enhancing educational approaches, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge art, science, and spirituality.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the artistic and philosophical insights of William Blake with the scientific principles of mitochondrial biology. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a deeper understanding of both the human experience and cellular functions, providing a framework for exploring the interconnectedness of creativity, energy, and life.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between art and science, proposing a holistic view of mitochondrial function that incorporates psychological and spiritual dimensions. The novelty lies in the application of Blake's visionary concepts to biological processes, offering fresh perspectives on energy production, cellular dynamics, and human well-being.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and duality inform our understanding of mitochondrial function?
2. What new theoretical models emerge from the integration of Blake’s philosophy and mitochondrial biology?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach enhance educational practices and societal perceptions of health and creativity?
