# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the visionary philosophy of William Blake with the scientific field of mitochondrial biology. By examining the isomorphisms between Blake's artistic and philosophical principles and the biological functions of mitochondria, this research seeks to propose a novel framework that redefines our understanding of cellular health, creativity, and spirituality. The implications of this interdisciplinary approach promise to revolutionize both fields, offering new insights into the nature of human experience, health, and the interconnectedness of life.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of the literary and artistic insights of William Blake with the scientific rigor of mitochondrial biology. This intersection presents a unique opportunity to explore the philosophical underpinnings of creativity and vitality within the context of cellular function.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the arts and sciences, proposing that mitochondrial health can be understood through a lens of creativity and spirituality. The novelty lies in reinterpreting biological processes as manifestations of imaginative and spiritual principles, thus enriching both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Blake's philosophical concepts illuminate our understanding of mitochondrial function?
- What new theoretical models can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
- In what ways can this research contribute to practical applications in health and education?
