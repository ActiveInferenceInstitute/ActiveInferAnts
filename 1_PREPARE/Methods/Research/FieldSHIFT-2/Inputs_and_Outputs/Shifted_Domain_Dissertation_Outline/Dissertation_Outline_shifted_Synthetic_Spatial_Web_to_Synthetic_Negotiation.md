# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Spatial Web into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Spatial Web and negotiation, creating a new framework that leverages advanced technologies to enhance negotiation processes. By integrating concepts such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain, this research seeks to redefine negotiation practices, improve communication, and foster trust among stakeholders. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academic contributions, promising practical applications in industries ranging from business to diplomacy, and opening avenues for future interdisciplinary studies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web represents a convergence of physical and digital environments, where technologies like AR and IoT enhance user experiences and decision-making processes. Negotiation, traditionally confined to dialogue-driven interactions, faces challenges such as communication inefficiencies and trust issues. This dissertation proposes a systematic integration of the Spatial Web's principles into negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of conventional negotiation methods by proposing a transformative framework that utilizes cutting-edge technologies. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of Spatial Web elements into negotiation, fostering a new paradigm that enhances engagement, transparency, and efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can AR and VR reshape cognitive processes in negotiation?
2. In what ways can IoT data inform and enhance negotiation strategies?
3. What role does Blockchain play in fostering trust and transparency in negotiation processes?
4. How can this integrated approach revolutionize negotiation education and practice?
