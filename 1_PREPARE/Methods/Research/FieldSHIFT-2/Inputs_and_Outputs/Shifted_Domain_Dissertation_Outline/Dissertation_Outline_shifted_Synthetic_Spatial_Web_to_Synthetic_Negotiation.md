By providing a comprehensive roadmap for future research and interdisciplinary collaboration, this dissertation seeks to contribute to both academic knowledge and practical applications in an increasingly digital world.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of the Spatial Web and negotiation represents a transformative shift in how individuals and organizations engage in dialogue and decision-making. The Spatial Web, characterized by the seamless integration of physical and digital environments, offers unprecedented opportunities for real-time interaction and data exchange. As negotiations increasingly occur in digital spaces, the need for innovative strategies that incorporate these advancements becomes essential.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to redefine negotiation practices by integrating advanced technologies that enhance communication, understanding, and collaboration. The novelty lies in the development of a new theoretical framework that combines principles from both the Spatial Web and negotiation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of how these domains can synergistically improve negotiation outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Spatial Web be integrated into negotiation practices to enhance effectiveness?
