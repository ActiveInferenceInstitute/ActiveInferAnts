# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Free Energy Principle & Active Inference in Exercise Science

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with the field of Exercise Science. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research seeks to develop novel hypotheses, frameworks, and practical applications that could significantly enhance exercise adherence, personalization, and overall health outcomes. The implications of this research extend beyond academia, promising to impact industry practices, policy formulation, and societal health initiatives.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy through predictive processing and active inference. Exercise Science, on the other hand, focuses on optimizing physical activity for health and performance. The intersection of these fields presents a unique opportunity to redefine exercise paradigms and enhance individual engagement through a deeper understanding of cognitive and behavioral processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges theoretical constructs from cognitive neuroscience with practical applications in exercise science. It introduces a new lens through which to view exercise behavior, emphasizing the role of predictive models and active engagement in optimizing fitness outcomes. This novel approach could lead to more effective interventions and a better understanding of the psychological underpinnings of exercise adherence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of predictive processing and active inference be applied to enhance exercise adherence and performance?
2. What are the implications of variational free energy for designing personalized exercise programs?
3. How do social contexts influence individual exercise behaviors through the lens of Markov blankets?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The Free Energy Principle has evolved through interdisciplinary research, gaining traction in neuroscience and psychology. Exercise Science has similarly progressed, recognizing the multifaceted benefits of physical activity beyond mere fitness.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature highlights the applications of FEP in understanding cognition and behavior, while exercise science is increasingly incorporating technology to monitor and enhance performance. However, there is limited exploration of the synergies between these domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of FEP and exercise science reveals gaps in understanding how cognitive processes influence exercise behavior and adherence. This research aims to capitalize on these gaps by developing a cohesive framework that merges theoretical insights with practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Active Training Inference**: The process of refining training strategies based on feedback.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines FEP with exercise science, illustrating how predictive processing and active inference can inform exercise program design and adherence strategies.

## Methodology
