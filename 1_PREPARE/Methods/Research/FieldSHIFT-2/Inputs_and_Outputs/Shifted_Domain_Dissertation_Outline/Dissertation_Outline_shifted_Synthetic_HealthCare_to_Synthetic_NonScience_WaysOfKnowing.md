# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of health care principles and non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework that enhances patient care through cultural sensitivity and holistic approaches. By systematically transposing core health care concepts into non-scientific realms, the research seeks to address gaps in current health care practices and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. The potential impact includes improved patient outcomes, enriched cultural understanding, and the establishment of new educational paradigms that embrace diverse knowledge systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary approach that merges the structured methodologies of health care with the rich, narrative-driven perspectives of non-science ways of knowing. This fusion recognizes the limitations of traditional health care models and seeks to incorporate holistic and culturally relevant practices into patient care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional boundaries of health care by advocating for the inclusion of non-scientific knowledge systems. It emphasizes the importance of understanding patients' cultural backgrounds, personal narratives, and holistic experiences, thereby promoting a more inclusive and effective health care model.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can health care principles be effectively integrated into non-science ways of knowing to enhance patient care?
- What are the implications of this integration for health care practices, education, and policy?
- What new theoretical frameworks can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Health Care:** Evolution from paternalistic models to patient-centered care.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Historical roots in cultural traditions and oral histories.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Health Care:** Trends in telehealth, personalized medicine, and mental health integration.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Recognition of the value of narrative, cultural beliefs, and holistic experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between scientific and non-scientific knowledge in health care.
- Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration that respects diverse cultural practices.

## Theoretical Framework
