# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics Principles to Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of logistics principles into the healthcare sector, proposing a transformative framework that enhances operational efficiency, patient experience, and resource optimization. By systematically transposing key logistics methodologies to healthcare practices, this research seeks to address pressing challenges such as patient flow management, supply chain inefficiencies, and rising operational costs. The potential impact of this work extends beyond theoretical contributions, offering practical solutions that can revolutionize healthcare delivery and foster sustainable practices within the industry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of logistics and healthcare is a burgeoning field that leverages the operational efficiencies inherent in logistics to address the complexities of healthcare delivery. Historically, logistics has focused on the efficient movement and management of goods, while healthcare has prioritized patient care and service quality. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge critical gaps between logistics and healthcare, creating a new paradigm that prioritizes patient-centered care through optimized resource management. This novel approach not only addresses existing inefficiencies but also sets the stage for future innovations in health service delivery.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively transposed to enhance patient flow and care coordination in healthcare settings?
2. What are the implications of adopting just-in-time inventory management techniques for medical supplies in hospitals?
