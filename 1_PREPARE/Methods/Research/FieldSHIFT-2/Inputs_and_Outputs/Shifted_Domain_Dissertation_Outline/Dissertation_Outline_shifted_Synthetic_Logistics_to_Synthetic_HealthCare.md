# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics into Healthcare

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore and establish the Shifted Domain of integrating logistics principles into healthcare delivery systems. By leveraging the efficiency, coordination, and data-driven methodologies of logistics, this research will address critical challenges in healthcare, such as patient flow, resource allocation, and service quality. The potential impact of this work is transformative, promising to enhance patient experiences, optimize healthcare operations, and contribute to the development of new interdisciplinary fields. The findings will not only advance academic discourse but also offer practical applications that can reshape healthcare practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of logistics and healthcare, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Logistics focuses on the optimization of goods movement and storage, while healthcare emphasizes patient care and service delivery. The convergence of these domains presents an opportunity to apply logistics principles to improve healthcare systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to the increasing demand for efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare delivery. By applying logistics methodologies, we can streamline operations, enhance patient experiences, and potentially lower costs. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, which has been underexplored in existing literature.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively transposed into healthcare delivery systems?
2. What impact does the application of logistics methodologies have on patient flow and satisfaction?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these fields?
4. What are the practical implications for healthcare providers and policymakers?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Logistics:** Evolution from basic transportation to complex supply chain management, driven by technological advancements and globalization.
- **Healthcare:** Transition from paternalistic models to patient-centered approaches, focusing on quality and collaboration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Logistics:** Emphasis on efficiency, real-time data utilization, and customer satisfaction.
- **Healthcare:** Challenges include inefficiencies in patient flow, communication barriers, and resource management.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between logistics principles and healthcare practices.
- Opportunities to enhance patient care through improved operational efficiency and real-time data analytics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Logistics Theories:** Supply Chain Management (SCM), Just-In-Time (JIT) principles, and Route Optimization.
- **Healthcare Theories:** Patient-Centered Care, Health Systems Theory, and Quality Improvement Frameworks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Care Logistics:** A new framework for understanding patient flow and resource allocation in healthcare.
- **Patient Journey Mapping:** A method for visualizing and optimizing the patient experience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines logistics methodologies with healthcare delivery principles, focusing on efficiency, coordination, and data utilization.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research to assess the impact of logistics principles on healthcare delivery.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with healthcare providers and patients.
- Analysis of patient flow and satisfaction metrics before and after implementing logistics principles.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis to measure changes in patient flow and satisfaction.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring patient confidentiality and informed consent, and addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis.
