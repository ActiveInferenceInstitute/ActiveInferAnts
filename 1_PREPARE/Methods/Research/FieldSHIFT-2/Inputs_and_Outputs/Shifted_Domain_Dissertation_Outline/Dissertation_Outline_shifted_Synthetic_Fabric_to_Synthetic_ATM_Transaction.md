# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with ATM transactions. By investigating the potential for integrating artistic design, sustainability, and user-centered approaches, the research will propose a new model for ATM design that enhances user engagement and satisfaction while addressing environmental concerns. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize banking interfaces, making them more culturally relevant and environmentally sustainable. The outcomes of this research could lead to the development of a new sub-discipline that merges design thinking with financial technology, ultimately impacting both industries positively.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, known for its creativity and craftsmanship, has begun to embrace sustainability and technological advancements. In parallel, ATM transactions, pivotal in modern banking, are facing challenges related to user experience and security. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that transposes principles from the fabric industry into ATM design, aiming to create a more engaging and sustainable banking experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it combines two traditionally separate domains to create a unique perspective on ATM design. By leveraging the artistic and sustainable practices of the fabric industry, this study aims to redefine how users interact with ATMs, addressing both aesthetic and functional needs.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of textile design enhance the user experience of ATMs?
2. What sustainable practices from the fabric industry can be applied to ATM operations?
3. How does the integration of cultural narratives into ATM design affect user engagement?
