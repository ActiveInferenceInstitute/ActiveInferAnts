# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with ATM transactions, proposing a transformative framework that enhances user experience, promotes sustainability, and reflects cultural significance. By integrating customizable designs, eco-friendly practices, and artistic elements into ATM interfaces, this research aims to redefine the role of ATMs from mere transactional machines to vibrant community hubs. The study will provide a roadmap for future research, practical applications, and interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately contributing to both the fields of financial technology and design.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, characterized by creativity, customization, and cultural significance, contrasts sharply with the standardization and efficiency of ATM transactions. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, exploring how principles from textile design can enhance the functionality and user engagement of ATMs.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only addresses the growing need for personalized banking experiences but also emphasizes sustainability and cultural representation in technology. The novelty lies in the application of artistic principles to financial technology, creating a new paradigm that challenges existing norms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can customizable ATM interfaces enhance user satisfaction and engagement?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating artistic elements into ATM designs?
3. How can sustainable practices be effectively implemented in ATM operations?
