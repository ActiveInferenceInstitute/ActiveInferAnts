# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Guest Experience through Game Design Principles

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of game design and guest experience, proposing a transformative framework that leverages game mechanics to enhance hospitality services. The research aims to establish a comprehensive understanding of how game design principles can be integrated into guest experiences to drive engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty. By investigating the intersections of these two fields, this dissertation seeks to create a new paradigm in hospitality that not only meets but exceeds evolving guest expectations. The potential impact of this research extends to both academic and practical realms, offering insights into new business models, service design, and guest interaction strategies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The shift from game design to guest experience represents a groundbreaking intersection of two previously distinct fields. Game design, rooted in engagement and interactivity, has evolved significantly, while guest experience has increasingly focused on personalization and service quality. This dissertation aims to synthesize these domains, exploring how game design principles can revolutionize guest interactions in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in the hospitality industryâ€”how to create memorable and engaging experiences that resonate with modern travelers. By applying game design principles, such as feedback loops and player agency, to guest experiences, this dissertation presents a novel approach to enhancing service quality and customer satisfaction.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into guest experience strategies?
2. What are the potential impacts of gamification on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can feedback mechanisms from game design inform service improvements in hospitality?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Game Design
- Evolution from simple mechanics to complex narratives and immersive experiences.
- Influence of technology and player expectations on game development.

#### Guest Experience
- Transition from traditional service models to personalized, tech-driven approaches.
- Impact of consumer behavior and technological advancements on hospitality.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Game design emphasizes engagement, feedback, and player agency.
- Guest experience focuses on personalization, service quality, and technology integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- **Service Quality Models:** Frameworks for assessing and improving service delivery in hospitality.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Gamification in Service Design:** Exploring how game mechanics can enhance service interactions.
- **Dynamic Personalization Models:** The use of AI and data analytics for tailored experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines engagement theory from game design with service quality frameworks in hospitality, focusing on feedback loops, personalization, and user agency.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of game design principles into guest experience.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** Collecting data on guest preferences and experiences.
- **Interviews:** Engaging with industry experts and hospitality professionals.
- **Case Studies:** Analyzing successful implementations of gamification in hospitality.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify trends and correlations.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality, informed consent, and ethical treatment of data throughout the research process.
