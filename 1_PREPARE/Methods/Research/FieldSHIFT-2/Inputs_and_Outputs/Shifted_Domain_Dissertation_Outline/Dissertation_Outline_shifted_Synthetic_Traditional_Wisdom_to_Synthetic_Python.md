# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into Python Programming

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating traditional knowledge (TK) into Python programming. By establishing a dialogue between these two distinct domains, the research will provide a comprehensive framework for developing community-centric, sustainable programming practices that resonate with indigenous knowledge systems. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both fields, offering innovative methodologies that enhance ecological stewardship and cultural relevance in technology. This research has the potential to revolutionize software development, creating tools that not only serve technical purposes but also foster community engagement and environmental sustainability.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainability, ecological balance, and community-centric approaches. Python, a versatile programming language, has emerged as a dominant tool in various fields, including data science and web development. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, exploring how TK can enhance programming practices and promote sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of TK into Python programming represents a novel approach that challenges traditional paradigms in both fields. By reimagining programming through the lens of TK, this research aims to foster a more inclusive and sustainable technological landscape. The findings will provide insights into how programming can be adapted to reflect cultural narratives and ecological principles.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can traditional knowledge be effectively integrated into Python programming practices?
2. What are the implications of this integration for sustainability and community engagement in software development?
3. How can new pedagogical approaches be developed to teach Python programming through the lens of traditional knowledge?
