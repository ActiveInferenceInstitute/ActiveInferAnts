# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Mitochondrial Biology to Negotiation Theory

---

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative integration of mitochondrial biology with negotiation theory, proposing a novel framework that views negotiation as a dynamic energy exchange akin to cellular respiration. By transposing principles from mitochondrial biology into negotiation practices, this research aims to uncover new strategies for effective negotiation, enhance understanding of emotional management, and promote healthier negotiation environments. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation education, inform practice, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in various fields, including business, conflict resolution, and public policy.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between mitochondrial biology, which focuses on cellular energy dynamics, and negotiation theory, which emphasizes dialogue and conflict resolution. Mitochondria are essential for energy production in cells, while negotiation is crucial for interpersonal and organizational interactions. The exploration of isomorphisms between these fields reveals profound insights into the nature of negotiation as an energy exchange process.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges conventional negotiation practices by introducing biological principles that govern energy dynamics. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of mitochondrial concepts into negotiation theory, offering a fresh perspective that can enhance negotiation strategies and outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can mitochondrial principles inform and enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What are the implications of viewing negotiation as an energy exchange process?
3. How can the integration of these fields foster healthier negotiation environments and relationships?
