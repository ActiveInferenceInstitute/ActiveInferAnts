# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Mitochondrial Concepts to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and negotiation theory, proposing a groundbreaking framework that draws parallels between cellular processes and negotiation dynamics. By transposing key mitochondrial concepts—such as energy generation, regulation, dynamics, biogenesis, dysfunction, and communication—into the realm of negotiation, this research aims to enhance understanding and effectiveness in negotiation practices. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation training, inform strategies across diverse contexts, and foster collaborative environments that lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The mitochondrion, known as the powerhouse of the cell, plays a critical role in energy production and cellular regulation. Negotiation, on the other hand, is a complex social process aimed at reaching agreements. This dissertation seeks to integrate these two distinct fields, leveraging mitochondrial principles to inform negotiation strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it combines biological concepts with social science, creating a unique interdisciplinary approach. By understanding negotiation through the lens of mitochondrial function, we can uncover new insights into value creation, process management, and relationship building.
