## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of quantum computation and negotiation, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Quantum computation, with its principles of superposition and entanglement, has revolutionized our understanding of information processing. Conversely, negotiation, often characterized by competitive paradigms, has remained largely static in its approach. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, proposing a fresh perspective on negotiation through the lens of quantum principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform negotiation practices by introducing quantum concepts that allow for a more nuanced understanding of interests and relationships. This novel approach challenges the conventional zero-sum mindset, promoting a paradigm where multiple outcomes can coexist, ultimately fostering cooperation and creativity in negotiations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of quantum computation be applied to enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What are the implications of viewing negotiation through the lens of superposition and entanglement?
3. How can a Quantum Negotiation Model be developed and validated?
