# PhD Dissertation Plan: Quantum Computation in the Context of Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating quantum computation principles into negotiation practices. By examining the underlying similarities between these two distinct fields, the research will develop a comprehensive framework for "Quantum Negotiation," which leverages quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and dynamic strategies to enhance negotiation outcomes. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation methodologies, fostering more innovative, collaborative, and efficient practices across various sectors. The findings will contribute to both theoretical advancements and practical applications, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and educational paradigms.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Quantum computation represents a paradigm shift in information processing, utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations in ways that classical systems cannot. Negotiation, on the other hand, is a fundamental human activity aimed at achieving mutually beneficial agreements. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by identifying and applying quantum principles to negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging two traditionally separate fields to create a new framework for understanding negotiation. This research not only addresses existing gaps in negotiation theory but also opens new avenues for the application of quantum principles in social sciences.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of quantum computation enhance negotiation strategies and outcomes?
2. What are the theoretical implications of integrating quantum concepts into negotiation practices?
3. How can a quantum-inspired negotiation framework be developed and empirically tested?
