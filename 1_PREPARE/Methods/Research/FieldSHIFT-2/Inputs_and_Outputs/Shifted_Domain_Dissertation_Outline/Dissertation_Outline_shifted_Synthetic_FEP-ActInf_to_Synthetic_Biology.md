# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Ecosystem Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from cognitive and biological sciences with Ecosystem Dynamics, creating a Shifted Domain that offers a novel perspective on ecological interactions and resilience. By framing ecosystems as adaptive systems that minimize variational free energy through biodiversity and interspecies interactions, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem stability and functionality. The anticipated impact of this work extends to ecological management, conservation practices, and interdisciplinary education, ultimately contributing to sustainable environmental practices in the face of global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that all adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain functional integrity. Ecosystems, characterized by complex interactions and interdependencies, can be viewed through this lens, revealing deeper insights into their dynamics and resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation introduces a groundbreaking perspective by transposing principles from the FEP to ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the parallels between individual and collective adaptive behaviors in biological and ecological systems. This novel approach promises to enhance our understanding of ecological stability and inform conservation strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be systematically applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. What are the implications of viewing ecosystems as systems that minimize free energy for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management?
3. How can generative models be developed to predict ecosystem responses to environmental changes?
