# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into the Biology Ecosystem

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) into the study of biological ecosystems. By examining the parallels between adaptive systems in neuroscience and ecological dynamics, this research will provide a novel framework for understanding how ecosystems maintain stability and resilience in the face of environmental changes. The findings are expected to have significant implications for conservation strategies, biodiversity management, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that all adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. This principle has profound implications for understanding biological systems, particularly in the context of ecosystems, where interactions among organisms and their environments dictate stability and resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it bridges two previously distinct domains—cognitive neuroscience and ecology—creating a framework that enhances our understanding of both fields. By applying the FEP to ecosystems, we can reframe ecological dynamics as predictive systems, leading to innovative approaches in ecosystem management and conservation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the Free Energy Principle be applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. What role does active inference play in species interactions and ecosystem resilience?
3. How can predictive models enhance biodiversity management and conservation strategies?
