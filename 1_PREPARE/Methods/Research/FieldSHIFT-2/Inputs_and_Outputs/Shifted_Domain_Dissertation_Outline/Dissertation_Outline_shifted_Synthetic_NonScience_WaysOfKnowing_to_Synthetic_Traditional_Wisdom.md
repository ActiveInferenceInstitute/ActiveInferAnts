# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing into traditional knowledge systems. By examining the intersection of these two domains, the research will highlight how subjective experiences, emotional intelligence, and holistic perspectives can enhance ecological management, community resilience, and cultural preservation. The anticipated outcomes include the development of new theoretical frameworks, practical applications in environmental stewardship, and a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive epistemological landscape.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel convergence between non-science ways of knowing—characterized by intuitive, experiential, and culturally contextualized knowledge—and traditional knowledge systems that have evolved through generations within indigenous and local communities. This fusion holds potential for reimagining ecological management and cultural practices in a rapidly changing world.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to challenge the dominance of empirical science by advocating for a broader understanding of knowledge creation that includes diverse epistemologies. This study addresses the urgent need for sustainable practices in the face of environmental degradation and cultural loss, positioning itself at the forefront of interdisciplinary research.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing enhance traditional ecological practices?
- What are the implications of integrating emotional intelligence and narrative approaches in community engagement?
- How can this integration foster cultural resilience and environmental stewardship?
