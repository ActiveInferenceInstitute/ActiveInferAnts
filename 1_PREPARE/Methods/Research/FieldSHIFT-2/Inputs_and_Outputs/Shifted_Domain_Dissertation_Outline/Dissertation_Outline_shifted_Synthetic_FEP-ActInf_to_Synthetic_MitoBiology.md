# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle to Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and mitochondrial function, proposing a novel framework that reconsiders mitochondria as adaptive systems employing predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy to optimize energy production and maintain cellular health. By examining how these theoretical constructs can be transposed to mitochondrial dynamics, this research promises to uncover new insights into mitochondrial behavior, inform therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial dysfunction, and revolutionize our understanding of cellular energetics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity and functionality. Mitochondria, as the powerhouses of the cell, play a crucial role in energy production and metabolism. This dissertation explores the potential of integrating these two domains, suggesting that mitochondria may operate under principles akin to those guiding cognitive processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges cognitive neuroscience and cellular biology, providing a fresh perspective on mitochondrial function. By applying concepts from FEP to mitochondrial dynamics, this study aims to reveal underlying mechanisms of energy management that could lead to advancements in understanding metabolic disorders and developing new therapeutic approaches.
