# PhD Dissertation Plan: Free Energy Principle & Active Inference Applied to Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with mitochondrial biology. The proposed research will investigate how predictive coding and variational free energy can reshape our understanding of mitochondrial function, efficiency, and dynamics. By establishing a novel theoretical framework, this research seeks to bridge gaps between these domains, offering new insights into mitochondrial dysfunction, potential therapeutic interventions, and interdisciplinary collaborations. The expected outcomes will significantly impact both fields and pave the way for innovative applications in health and disease management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy, which can be applied to understand the adaptive behaviors of mitochondria in response to cellular energy demands. Mitochondria, known as the powerhouses of the cell, are integral to energy production, metabolism, and cellular signaling. The intersection of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of both the FEP and mitochondrial biology.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a new paradigm for understanding mitochondrial function through the lens of predictive coding and active inference. It challenges traditional models of mitochondrial biology by proposing that mitochondria are not passive energy producers but active participants in cellular adaptation. This novel perspective could lead to groundbreaking insights into mitochondrial dysfunction and its implications for various diseases.
