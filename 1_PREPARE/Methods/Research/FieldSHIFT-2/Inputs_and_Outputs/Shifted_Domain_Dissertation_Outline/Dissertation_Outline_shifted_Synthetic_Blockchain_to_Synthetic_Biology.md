# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Blockchain Technology with Ecosystem Management

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology with ecosystem management, creating a Shifted Domain that combines principles from both fields. The research will investigate how decentralized systems can enhance biodiversity conservation, improve resource management, and foster community engagement. By developing a comprehensive framework for decentralized ecosystem management (DEM), this dissertation seeks to make significant contributions to both blockchain technology and ecological sciences, ultimately promoting sustainable practices and resilience in ecosystems. The findings are expected to have profound implications for policy, industry practices, and societal values regarding environmental stewardship.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the convergence of blockchain technology and ecosystem management. Blockchain, characterized by decentralization, immutability, and transparency, presents innovative solutions for addressing the complex challenges faced by ecosystems, such as biodiversity loss and resource mismanagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers the application of blockchain principles to ecological contexts, offering a novel lens through which to examine and manage ecosystems. The integration of these two domains is unprecedented and holds the potential to revolutionize environmental governance and conservation efforts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology be effectively applied to enhance ecosystem management?
2. What are the implications of decentralized decision-making on biodiversity conservation?
3. In what ways can tokenization of ecosystem services create new economic incentives for sustainability?
4. To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that integrates principles from both domains.
