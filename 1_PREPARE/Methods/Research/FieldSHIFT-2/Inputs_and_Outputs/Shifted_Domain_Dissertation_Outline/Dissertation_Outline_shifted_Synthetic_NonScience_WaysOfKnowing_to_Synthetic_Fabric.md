# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of non-science ways of knowing and the fabric industry, proposing a transformative framework that integrates subjective experiences, cultural narratives, and emotional intelligence into textile design and production. By reimagining the fabric industry through holistic and intuitive practices, this research seeks to address contemporary challenges such as sustainability, ethical production, and cultural appropriation. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both fields, offering new methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and practical applications that can foster a more inclusive and culturally aware fabric industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of non-science ways of knowing, characterized by subjective and holistic approaches, with the fabric industry, which traditionally emphasizes empirical and technical practices, presents a unique opportunity for innovation. This shift recognizes the importance of cultural context, emotional resonance, and narrative in shaping the design and production of textiles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing paradigms in the fabric industry and advocates for the integration of diverse ways of knowing. By valuing emotional intelligence and cultural narratives, the dissertation aims to redefine the role of textiles in society, making them not just commodities but vessels of meaning and identity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the design and production processes in the fabric industry?
- What impact do cultural narratives embedded in textiles have on consumer engagement and emotional connections?
- In what ways can intuitive design practices lead to innovation within the fabric industry?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Exploration of indigenous knowledge systems, oral traditions, and philosophical inquiry.
- **Fabric Industry Evolution:** Transition from traditional craftsmanship to industrial manufacturing, highlighting the disconnect between artisanship and consumer culture.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

- **Non-Science Knowledge:** Recognition of the value of holistic understanding and emotional intelligence in contemporary discourse.
- **Fabric Industry Challenges:** Issues of sustainability, ethical production, and the need for cultural sensitivity in design.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Lack of integration of non-scientific methodologies in the fabric industry.
- Opportunities to create a more culturally responsive and emotionally resonant fabric industry.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Holism:** Understanding knowledge as interconnected systems.
- **Cultural Narratives:** The significance of storytelling in conveying complex ideas.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Cultural Resonance Theory:** The impact of narrative-driven textiles on consumer engagement.
- **Intuitive Design Impact Theory:** The role of intuition in fostering creativity and innovation.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A model that combines holistic understanding, emotional intelligence, and cultural narratives to enhance textile design and production.
