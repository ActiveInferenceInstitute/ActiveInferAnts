# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing into the field of negotiation. By examining the core principles of intuition, cultural narratives, and holistic approaches, the research seeks to develop a new framework that enhances negotiation practices. The significance of this work lies in its ability to foster deeper connections between negotiating parties, improve conflict resolution outcomes, and contribute to a more empathetic society. The potential impact extends beyond negotiation, influencing related fields such as conflict resolution, organizational management, and education.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of non-science ways of knowing into negotiation represents a paradigm shift that challenges traditional views of negotiation as purely analytical and competitive. This shift recognizes the importance of emotional intelligence, cultural narratives, and holistic approaches in understanding human interactions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research addresses the gaps in current negotiation practices that often overlook the emotional and cultural dimensions of human interaction. By incorporating non-science perspectives, the dissertation aims to create a more comprehensive understanding of negotiation that enhances relational dynamics and fosters collaborative outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance negotiation practices?
2. What are the implications of integrating emotional intelligence and cultural narratives into negotiation frameworks?
3. How can a holistic approach to negotiation lead to more effective conflict resolution?
