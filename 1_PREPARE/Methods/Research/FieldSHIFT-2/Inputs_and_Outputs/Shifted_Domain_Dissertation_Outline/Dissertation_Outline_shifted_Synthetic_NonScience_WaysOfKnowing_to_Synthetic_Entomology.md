# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of non-science ways of knowing with entomology presents a novel approach to understanding insects. Non-scientific methodologies emphasize cultural narratives, emotional intelligence, and holistic perspectives, contrasting with the empirical focus of traditional entomological research. This dissertation seeks to explore how these diverse ways of knowing can enhance our understanding of insect ecology and promote sustainable practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for several reasons: 

1. **Interdisciplinary Innovation**: It pioneers a new approach that integrates cultural and experiential knowledge into a field often dominated by empirical methodologies.
2. **Cultural Relevance**: By recognizing the importance of local ecological knowledge, the research validates diverse perspectives and promotes inclusivity in scientific inquiry.
3. **Practical Applications**: The findings will inform conservation strategies, pest management, and community engagement, ultimately leading to more sustainable interactions with insect populations.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance our understanding of insect ecology and behavior?
2. What are the implications of integrating cultural narratives and experiential learning for entomological research and practice?
3. How can this integration foster community engagement and promote sustainable practices in insect conservation?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The historical evolution of non-science ways of knowing reveals a rich tapestry of cultural practices, oral traditions, and holistic methodologies that have shaped human understanding of the natural world. Conversely, the development of entomology has been characterized by a focus on empirical research, scientific methodologies, and the biological sciences.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent trends in both fields highlight a growing recognition of the value of interdisciplinary approaches. In entomology, there is an increasing interest in understanding the ecological roles of insects within broader ecosystems. In non-science ways of knowing, there is a resurgence of interest in indigenous knowledge systems and the importance of experiential learning.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, significant gaps exist in the integration of non-scientific methodologies into entomological research. The opportunities presented by this shifted domain include:

- Developing a more holistic understanding of insect ecology.
- Enhancing community engagement through culturally relevant narratives.
- Fostering sustainable practices informed by local knowledge.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Cultural Ecology**: Examines the relationships between cultural practices and ecological systems.
2. **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Emphasizes the role of experience and social context in knowledge acquisition.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Eco-Cultural Knowledge Framework**: Integrates ecological understanding with cultural narratives and practices.
2. **Emotional Ecology Theory**: Explores the emotional connections between humans and insects, influencing conservation behaviors.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model synthesizes insights from cultural ecology and constructivist learning theory, illustrating the interplay between cultural narratives, experiential learning, and ecological understanding in shaping human-insect relationships.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

This dissertation will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into entomology.

## Data Collection Methods

1. **Qualitative Interviews**: Conduct interviews with community members, indigenous knowledge holders, and entomologists to gather diverse perspectives.
2. **Field Observations**: Engage in field studies to observe insect behavior and human interactions with insect populations.
3. **Surveys**: Administer surveys to assess public perceptions of insects and conservation practices.

## Analytical Approaches

1. **Thematic Analysis**: Analyze qualitative data to identify key themes and narratives related to non-science ways of knowing.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Employ statistical methods to analyze survey data and quantify relationships between variables.

## Ethical Considerations

This research will prioritize ethical considerations, including obtaining informed consent from participants, respecting cultural sensitivities, and ensuring the responsible use of indigenous knowledge.
