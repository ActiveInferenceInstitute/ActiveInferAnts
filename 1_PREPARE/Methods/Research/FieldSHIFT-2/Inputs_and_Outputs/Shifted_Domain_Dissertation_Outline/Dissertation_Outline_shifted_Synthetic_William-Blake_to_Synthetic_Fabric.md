# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic principles and the contemporary fabric industry, proposing a transformative framework that integrates imagination, duality, and personal expression into textile design. By examining the historical significance of Blake's work alongside current paradigms in the fabric industry, this research seeks to identify opportunities for artistic expression, sustainability, and cultural narrative within textiles. The potential impact of this research lies in revolutionizing textile design practices, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and enhancing the societal relevance of fabric arts.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's life and work with the fabric industry creates a unique domain that challenges traditional paradigms in textile design. Blake's emphasis on imagination, spirituality, and social critique provides a rich foundation for reimagining fabric as a medium of artistic expression and cultural narrative.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between fine arts and industrial practices, promoting a holistic approach to textile design that values personal vision and sustainability. The novelty of this work lies in its interdisciplinary nature, merging literary analysis, art history, and textile design to create a new paradigm for fabric production.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can William Blake’s artistic principles inform contemporary textile design?
2. In what ways can textiles serve as a narrative medium reflecting societal issues?
3. What are the implications of integrating spirituality and sustainability in fabric arts?
