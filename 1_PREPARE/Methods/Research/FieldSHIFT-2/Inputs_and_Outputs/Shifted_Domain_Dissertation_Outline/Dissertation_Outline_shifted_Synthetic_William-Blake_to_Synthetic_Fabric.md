# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative intersection of William Blake's life and artistic philosophy with contemporary practices in the fabric industry. By investigating the transformative potential of integrating Blake's visionary concepts—such as the coexistence of contraries and the importance of narrative—into textile design, this research aims to redefine the role of fabric as a medium for storytelling and cultural representation. The significance of this work lies in its potential to inspire sustainable practices, foster cultural dialogue, and enhance emotional engagement with textiles. Ultimately, this dissertation seeks to contribute to both the fields of literary studies and textile arts, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and innovative practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of William Blake's artistic vision with the fabric industry represents a novel approach that challenges traditional boundaries between literature and visual art. Blake's integration of text and imagery, along with his exploration of dualities, provides a rich framework for reimagining textile design.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to bridge two previously distinct fields, offering fresh perspectives on creativity, sustainability, and cultural representation. By applying Blake's philosophical concepts to fabric design, new opportunities for artistic expression and consumer engagement can be explored.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's principles of imagination and duality inform contemporary textile design?
2. In what ways can narrative textiles enhance emotional connections between consumers and fabrics?
3. What are the implications of integrating sustainable practices with artistic expression in the fabric industry?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **William Blake's Life and Work:** Exploration of Blake's biography, artistic methodologies, and philosophical beliefs.
- **Fabric Industry Evolution:** Overview of the textile industry's development, from traditional craftsmanship to modern challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Blake Studies:** Current research on Blake's influence on art, literature, and culture.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Narrative Textiles:** Conceptualization of textiles as carriers of stories and cultural narratives.
- **Contradictory Design Principles:** Framework for exploring dualities in fabric patterns and designs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A model that combines literary analysis, textile design principles, and sustainability practices to create a holistic approach to fabric arts.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Qualitative and quantitative methods will be employed to explore the integration of Blake's concepts into textile design.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and focus groups with consumers to assess emotional responses to narrative textiles.
- Interviews with textile artists and designers to understand their perspectives on integrating literary elements.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to identify key themes and patterns.
- Statistical analysis of survey data to evaluate consumer engagement with narrative textiles.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring respectful representation of cultural narratives in textile designs.
- Obtaining informed consent from participants in surveys and interviews.
