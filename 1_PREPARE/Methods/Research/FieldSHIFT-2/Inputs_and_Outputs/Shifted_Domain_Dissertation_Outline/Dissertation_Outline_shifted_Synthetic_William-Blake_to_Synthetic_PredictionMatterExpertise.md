# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake’s Life and Work into Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates the visionary elements of William Blake's life and work with the analytical rigor of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By exploring the interplay between imagination and reason, this research aims to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making processes in various fields. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize PME practices by advocating for a balanced approach that incorporates creative and intuitive insights alongside traditional data-driven methodologies. The impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering practical applications in industry, policy-making, and societal engagement.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake’s artistic and philosophical insights with PME represents a paradigm shift in how predictions can be made and understood. Blake’s emphasis on imagination, duality, and social critique provides a rich context for rethinking predictive analytics, which traditionally relies heavily on quantitative data and rational analysis.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing norms of PME by proposing an integrated approach that values both analytical and imaginative thinking. The novelty of this work lies in its interdisciplinary nature, bridging literature, art, and data science to create a more holistic understanding of prediction.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and duality inform and enhance predictive models in PME?
2. What are the implications of integrating artistic expression into data visualization and communication in PME?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach reshape educational curricula and training in PME?
