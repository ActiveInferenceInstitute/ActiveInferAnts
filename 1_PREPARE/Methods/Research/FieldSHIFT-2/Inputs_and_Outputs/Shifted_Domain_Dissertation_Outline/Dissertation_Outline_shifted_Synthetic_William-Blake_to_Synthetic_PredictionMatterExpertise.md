# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating William Blake's artistic vision and philosophical insights into the field of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME). By synthesizing the dualities present in Blake's work with contemporary predictive methodologies, this research seeks to develop an innovative framework that enhances predictive accuracy and fosters creativity in decision-making processes. The anticipated impact of this research extends beyond academia into practical applications across various industries, offering a novel perspective on how interdisciplinary approaches can address complex global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain arises from the intersection of two distinct fields: the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, and Prediction Matter Expertise, a contemporary discipline focused on synthesizing knowledge for informed decision-making. This convergence highlights the potential for creative insights to enrich analytical processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional boundaries of PME by incorporating artistic and imaginative methodologies derived from Blake's work. The novelty lies in proposing a framework that values creativity alongside analytical rigor, potentially revolutionizing how predictions are approached in various sectors.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of Blake's art and poetry inform and enhance predictive methodologies in PME?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary integration?
3. In what ways can imaginative thinking improve decision-making processes in complex scenarios?
