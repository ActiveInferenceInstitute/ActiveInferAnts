# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of Buckminster Fuller’s design principles with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference, focusing on how these frameworks can provide a comprehensive understanding of adaptive systems. The research will investigate the synergies between Fuller's holistic approach and the predictive modeling inherent in the FEP, leading to novel hypotheses and practical applications in sustainability, artificial intelligence, and ecological management. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to reshape interdisciplinary dialogue, enhance adaptive strategies, and foster sustainable practices across various domains.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of Buckminster Fuller’s design science and the theoretical underpinnings of the Free Energy Principle. Fuller’s emphasis on holistic systems thinking and sustainable resource management aligns with the FEP's focus on minimizing variational free energy through adaptive behaviors. By transposing these concepts, we can develop a richer understanding of how organisms and systems interact with their environments.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to bridge two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on adaptability, sustainability, and resource management. The novelty lies in the application of Fuller's principles to contemporary challenges in ecology and artificial intelligence, creating new pathways for research and practical solutions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller's concepts of synergetics and ephemeralization enhance our understanding of adaptive systems within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
2. In what ways can these integrated theories inform the development of sustainable resource management strategies?
3. What implications does this synthesis have for the fields of ecology, artificial intelligence, and design science?
