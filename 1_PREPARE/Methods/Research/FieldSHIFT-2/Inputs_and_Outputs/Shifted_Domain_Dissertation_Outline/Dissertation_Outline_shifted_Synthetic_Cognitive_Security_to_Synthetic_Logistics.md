# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive security and logistics, proposing a novel framework termed "Cognitive Logistics." By integrating cognitive security principles into logistics operations, the research seeks to enhance information integrity, mitigate misinformation risks, and improve decision-making processes. This work is significant as it addresses pressing challenges in supply chain management and sets the stage for future interdisciplinary research. The potential impact includes improved operational resilience, increased stakeholder trust, and the establishment of new standards in logistics practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from misinformation and cognitive threats, while logistics involves the efficient movement and management of goods and information. The fusion of these domains creates opportunities to enhance the integrity of logistics operations through cognitive security measures.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is pioneering in its approach to apply cognitive security principles to logistics, addressing the growing challenges of misinformation in supply chains. By developing a framework for Cognitive Logistics, the dissertation will contribute to both fields, providing a blueprint for operational excellence and resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be integrated into logistics operations to enhance information integrity?
2. What are the potential impacts of misinformation on logistics, and how can these be mitigated?
3. What frameworks and methodologies can be developed to train logistics personnel in cognitive security?

## Literature Review
