# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Free Energy Principle & Active Inference to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection between the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Cognitive Security, proposing a novel framework that integrates principles from both domains. The research will focus on how adaptive systems, as described by FEP, can inform strategies to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation and cognitive threats. By developing an interdisciplinary approach that combines insights from neuroscience, psychology, and cybersecurity, this dissertation seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of cognitive security and its implications for individuals and organizations in the digital age.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological organisms minimize variational free energy through predictive coding and active inference. Cognitive security, on the other hand, addresses the protection of cognitive processes from manipulation and misinformation. This dissertation explores the synergies between these two domains, proposing that cognitive threats can be framed as variational free energy minimization problems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it presents a paradigm shift in understanding cognitive security through the lens of adaptive systems theory. The novelty lies in the application of FEP concepts to cognitive security, creating a framework that enhances our understanding of how individuals and organizations can mitigate cognitive threats.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance cognitive security?
- What are the cognitive mechanisms that underpin susceptibility to misinformation?
