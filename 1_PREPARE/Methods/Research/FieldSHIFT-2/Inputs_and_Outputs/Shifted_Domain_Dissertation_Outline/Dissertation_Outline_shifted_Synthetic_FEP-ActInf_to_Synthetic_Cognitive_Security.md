# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Cognitive Security, proposing a novel framework that leverages principles from adaptive systems to enhance resilience against cognitive threats. By integrating concepts such as active inference, generative models, and variational free energy, this research aims to develop predictive models and strategies that address misinformation and cognitive biases. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform cognitive security practices and educational frameworks, ultimately contributing to a more robust societal defense against manipulation and misinformation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems strive to minimize prediction errors through active inference, creating a framework for understanding adaptive behavior. Cognitive Security, on the other hand, focuses on protecting cognitive processes from misinformation and manipulation. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by applying FEP concepts to enhance cognitive resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it offers a unique perspective on cognitive security, utilizing established theories from FEP to inform new strategies for combating misinformation. The novelty lies in the application of adaptive systems theory to cognitive processes, potentially reshaping how we understand and address cognitive threats.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance cognitive security?
2. What are the implications of generative models in predicting misinformation spread?
3. How can active inference strategies be utilized to mitigate cognitive biases in individuals and organizations?
