# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts (Domain A) with the Free Energy Principle (Domain B). By systematically transposing concepts from textile creation into the framework of adaptive systems, this research aims to develop a novel theoretical model that enhances our understanding of craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural expression. The findings will not only bridge the gap between art and science but also propose practical applications and educational reforms that can revolutionize both fields. The potential impact includes advancing sustainable practices in textiles, enhancing cognitive insights into creative processes, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry is a complex ecosystem involving creativity, craftsmanship, and sustainability, while the Free Energy Principle offers a theoretical lens to understand adaptive behavior in biological systems. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that integrates these two domains, emphasizing their shared principles of optimization and adaptation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers a new field that combines artistic expression with cognitive science. The novelty lies in the application of the Free Energy Principle to the fabric industry, redefining textiles as adaptive systems that reflect cognitive processes and cultural dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the practices of textile creation be understood as cognitive functions analogous to predictive coding?
2. In what ways do sustainable textile practices minimize variational free energy in the context of environmental adaptation?
3. How can smart textiles serve as predictive systems that enhance user adaptability?
