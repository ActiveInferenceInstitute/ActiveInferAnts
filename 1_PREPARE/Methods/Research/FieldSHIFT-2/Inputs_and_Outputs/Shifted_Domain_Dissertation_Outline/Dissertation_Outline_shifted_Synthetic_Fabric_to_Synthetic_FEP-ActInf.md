# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By systematically analyzing the creative processes, sustainability efforts, and technological advancements in the fabric industry, this research will propose an integrated framework that applies principles of predictive coding and active inference to textile design. The anticipated impact of this work includes advancing theoretical understanding in both fields, fostering innovation in sustainable practices, and addressing cultural narratives embedded in textiles. The findings will provide a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaboration, industry application, and future research directions.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has evolved from traditional craftsmanship to a complex ecosystem that incorporates sustainability and technological integration. Concurrently, the Free Energy Principle offers a robust theoretical framework for understanding adaptive systems. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, providing insights into how principles of cognitive science can inform and innovate textile design.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it uncovers synergies between creative processes in textile design and cognitive models of prediction and adaptation. By applying FEP and AI to the fabric industry, it opens new avenues for understanding how sustainability practices can be aligned with cognitive processes, ultimately leading to more resilient and adaptive systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of predictive processing and active inference be applied to enhance textile design?
2. In what ways do sustainable practices in the fabric industry reflect adaptive behaviors described by the Free Energy Principle?
3. What is the potential for cultural narratives embodied in textiles to inform our understanding of cognitive processes?
