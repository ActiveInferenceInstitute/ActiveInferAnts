# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Concepts into the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of blockchain technology and culinary practices, proposing a transformative framework that enhances transparency, sustainability, and cultural preservation in food systems. By integrating core blockchain principles such as decentralization, immutability, smart contracts, and tokenization into culinary practices, this research aims to create a new paradigm that addresses contemporary challenges in food security, sustainability, and cultural exchange. The findings will have significant implications for both fields, offering a roadmap for future research, industry applications, and educational initiatives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of two previously distinct fields: blockchain technology and cuisine. Blockchain, known for its decentralized and transparent nature, has revolutionized industries by enhancing trust and efficiency. Conversely, cuisine encompasses the rich tapestry of culinary traditions, practices, and challenges facing modern food systems. This dissertation seeks to explore how the principles of blockchain can be effectively transposed into culinary contexts, fostering innovation and addressing pressing global issues.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the critical need for sustainable food practices while preserving cultural heritage. The novelty lies in the unexplored potential of blockchain technology to reshape culinary practices, enabling decentralized networks for recipe sharing, sustainable ingredient sourcing, and cultural documentation. By bridging these two domains, the dissertation will contribute to the academic discourse on interdisciplinary approaches to complex problems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain principles enhance culinary practices to promote sustainability and cultural preservation?
2. What are the implications of decentralized culinary networks for recipe sharing and ingredient sourcing?
3. How can tokenization of culinary assets create new economic opportunities for chefs and food producers?
