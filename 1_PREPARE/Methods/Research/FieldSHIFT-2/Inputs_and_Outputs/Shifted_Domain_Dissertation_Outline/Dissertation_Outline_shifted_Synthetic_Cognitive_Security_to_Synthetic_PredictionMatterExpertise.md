# PhD Dissertation Plan: From Cognitive Security to Prediction Matter Expertise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Cognitive Security and Prediction Matter Expertise (PME), proposing a transformative framework that enhances predictive accuracy and resilience against cognitive biases. By integrating principles from cognitive security—focused on safeguarding cognitive processes from misinformation—with methodologies from PME, this research aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of how cognitive resilience can improve decision-making in uncertain environments. The findings promise to impact various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and technology, leading to more robust predictive analytics and informed decision-making practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the confluence of Cognitive Security and PME, two fields that, while distinct, share common ground in their focus on cognitive processes and decision-making. Cognitive Security emphasizes the protection of information integrity and human cognition, while PME leverages interdisciplinary approaches to enhance predictive capabilities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing need for resilience in decision-making processes amid an information-rich environment fraught with cognitive biases. The novelty lies in the systematic application of cognitive security principles to PME, creating a new paradigm that enhances prediction accuracy and promotes informed decision-making.
