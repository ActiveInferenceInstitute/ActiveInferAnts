3. How can the Shifted Domain create new pathways for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains
The study of entomology has evolved significantly, from early classifications of insect species to advanced ecological and behavioral studies. Agricultural engineering has similarly transitioned from rudimentary farming techniques to sophisticated technologies aimed at optimizing agricultural productivity.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current entomological research focuses on insect conservation, biodiversity, and their roles in ecosystem services, while agricultural engineering emphasizes precision agriculture, sustainable practices, and technological innovations. Despite their advancements, both fields face challenges that could benefit from cross-disciplinary insights.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There is a notable lack of interdisciplinary research that combines entomological principles with agricultural engineering practices. This gap presents an opportunity to innovate and develop new methodologies that enhance sustainability and resilience in agriculture.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
