# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics into Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Response

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating logistics principles into humanitarian aid and disaster response. By establishing a framework for Humanitarian Supply Chain Management (HSCM), the research seeks to enhance the efficiency, responsiveness, and effectiveness of aid delivery in crisis situations. The findings are expected to significantly impact both the logistics and humanitarian sectors, paving the way for innovative practices and interdisciplinary collaborations that can ultimately save lives and improve the quality of aid.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of logistics and humanitarian aid represents a novel approach to crisis management, where established methodologies from logistics can address the inefficiencies and challenges faced in disaster response. This shift acknowledges the need for systematic planning, real-time data utilization, and effective resource management in humanitarian contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional paradigms in humanitarian aid, advocating for a proactive, data-driven approach. The novelty lies in the application of logistics methodologies to humanitarian settings, creating a new sub-discipline that can revolutionize how aid is delivered.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into humanitarian aid practices?
2. What metrics can be developed to measure the efficiency of humanitarian logistics?
3. How can technology enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian logistics?
