# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics into Humanitarian Aid

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating logistics principles into humanitarian aid, creating a new interdisciplinary framework that enhances efficiency, coordination, and responsiveness in disaster response operations. By analyzing the synergies between logistics and humanitarian aid, this research will contribute to the development of innovative strategies and technologies that address the systemic challenges faced in humanitarian contexts. The anticipated impact includes improved disaster response outcomes, enhanced resource management, and the establishment of sustainable practices in humanitarian logistics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Logistics, traditionally focused on the efficient movement and storage of goods, has significant implications for humanitarian aid, particularly in crisis situations. Humanitarian aid often grapples with inefficiencies and resource constraints that hinder timely assistance. This dissertation posits that the application of logistics principles can revolutionize humanitarian operations, enabling more effective disaster response.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of logistics into humanitarian aid represents a paradigm shift that not only addresses immediate operational challenges but also fosters long-term resilience in affected communities. This research is novel in its systematic approach to transposing established logistics methodologies into the humanitarian sector, creating a new lexicon and theoretical framework for future research and practice.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into humanitarian aid operations?
- What are the potential impacts of this integration on disaster response efficiency and effectiveness?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary fusion, and how can they inform practice?
