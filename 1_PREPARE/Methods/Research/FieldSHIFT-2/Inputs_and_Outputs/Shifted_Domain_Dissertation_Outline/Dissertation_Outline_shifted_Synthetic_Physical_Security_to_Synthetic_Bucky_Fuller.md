# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Physical Security and Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes holistic, adaptive, and sustainable security systems. The research will investigate how principles such as synergetics and tensegrity can be integrated into physical security frameworks to enhance resilience and efficiency. The potential impact of this research extends beyond security practices, influencing urban planning, environmental design, and societal values regarding safety and sustainability. By developing new theoretical constructs and practical applications, this dissertation seeks to contribute significantly to both fields, providing a roadmap for future interdisciplinary research and collaboration.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of Physical Security—a field focused on safeguarding assets and personnel—and Buckminster Fuller’s holistic design philosophy, which emphasizes sustainability, resource management, and innovative problem-solving. This integration presents a unique opportunity to rethink security measures within a broader context of environmental and social responsibility.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize traditional security practices by embedding them within a framework that prioritizes sustainability and adaptability. The novelty of this approach stems from the application of Fuller’s principles to physical security, creating a new paradigm that addresses contemporary challenges in urban environments.
