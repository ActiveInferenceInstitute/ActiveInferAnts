# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Mitochondrial Biology into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and traditional knowledge, proposing a transformative framework that integrates biological principles with indigenous ecological practices. By identifying isomorphisms between cellular processes and cultural sustainability, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of both fields, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and practical applications for environmental stewardship. The outcomes are expected to impact scientific research, educational curricula, and community resilience strategies, ultimately promoting a holistic approach to sustainability.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of mitochondrial biology, a cornerstone of cellular energetics, with traditional knowledge, which embodies ecological wisdom, presents a novel research frontier. This convergence emphasizes the importance of energy dynamics not only at the cellular level but also within communities that rely on sustainable practices for survival.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges a critical gap between the biological sciences and indigenous knowledge systems, promoting an understanding of sustainability that transcends disciplinary boundaries. The novelty lies in the application of biological frameworks to cultural practices, offering new insights into both fields and highlighting the relevance of traditional knowledge in contemporary ecological challenges.
