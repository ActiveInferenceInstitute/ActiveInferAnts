# PhD Dissertation Plan: Intelligent Soft Matter Transposed to Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating Intelligent Soft Matter (ISM) principles into the hospitality industry, specifically focusing on enhancing guest experiences. By leveraging the adaptive and responsive nature of ISM, this research aims to develop Intelligent Guest Experience Systems (IGES) that personalize service delivery, improve guest satisfaction, and foster brand loyalty. The significance of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging materials science and hospitality management to create novel frameworks for guest interaction. The potential impact includes not only enhanced guest experiences but also broader implications for service industries seeking to innovate through technology.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Intelligent Soft Matter and Guest Experience represents a groundbreaking shift in how hospitality services can be delivered. ISM refers to materials that can sense and respond to stimuli, while guest experience encompasses all interactions between guests and hospitality establishments. This intersection opens new avenues for creating responsive environments that adapt to guest needs.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel approach to guest experience management by applying principles of intelligent materials. The novelty lies in creating adaptive environments that can autonomously adjust to enhance guest satisfaction, thereby redefining traditional service models in hospitality.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ISM principles be effectively integrated into hospitality environments to enhance guest experiences?
2. What are the measurable impacts of IGES on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. What frameworks can be developed to guide the implementation of intelligent materials in hospitality settings?
