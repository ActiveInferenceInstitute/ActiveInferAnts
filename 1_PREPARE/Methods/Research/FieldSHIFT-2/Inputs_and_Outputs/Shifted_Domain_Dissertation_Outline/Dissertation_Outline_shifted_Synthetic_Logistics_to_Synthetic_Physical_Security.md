# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative integration of logistics principles into the field of physical security, forming a new interdisciplinary domain termed **Logistical Security Management (LSM)**. By applying logistics concepts such as efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and collaborative approaches to physical security, the research aims to enhance safety measures while optimizing resource allocation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize security practices, making them more responsive and efficient in the face of evolving threats. This work will provide a comprehensive framework for implementing LSM, address existing gaps in both fields, and propose a roadmap for future research and practical applications.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an intersection between logistics and physical security, two fields that have traditionally operated independently. Logistics focuses on the efficient movement and storage of goods, while physical security emphasizes the protection of assets through various measures. This dissertation will investigate how principles from logistics can be transposed to enhance physical security practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which seeks to leverage the strengths of logistics—such as optimization, data analytics, and collaborative practices—to address the challenges faced in physical security. By establishing LSM as a framework, the dissertation aims to fill existing gaps in both fields and propose innovative solutions to contemporary security challenges.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into physical security practices?
- What are the anticipated benefits of applying logistics methodologies to security management?
- In what ways can LSM transform the current landscape of physical security?
