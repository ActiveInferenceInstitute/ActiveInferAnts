# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Chemical Reactions to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and cognitive security, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and mitigating misinformation. By transposing core concepts from chemistry—such as transformation processes, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, and thermodynamics—into the realm of cognitive security, this research seeks to establish a novel theoretical model that enhances our understanding of how misinformation spreads and can be countered. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize cognitive security practices, education, and technology, ultimately contributing to a more informed and resilient society.
