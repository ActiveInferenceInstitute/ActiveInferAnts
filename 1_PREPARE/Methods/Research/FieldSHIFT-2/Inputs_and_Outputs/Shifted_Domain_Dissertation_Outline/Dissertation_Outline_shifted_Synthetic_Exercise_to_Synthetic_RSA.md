### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to revolutionize RSA cryptographic practices by introducing dynamic, exercise-inspired methodologies. The novelty lies in the application of exercise principles—such as progressive overload, recovery, and technique training—into cryptographic systems, fostering a paradigm shift in how security protocols are designed and implemented.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can exercise principles inform the development of adaptive cryptographic systems?
2. What are the implications of integrating recovery mechanisms into RSA protocols?
3. How can training programs for developers enhance the security of RSA implementations?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
