# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Guest Experience Domain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the fabric industry and arts with the guest experience domain in hospitality. By examining how textile design principles can enhance guest satisfaction, cultural appreciation, and sustainability, this research will provide a comprehensive framework for integrating these two distinct fields. The anticipated impact includes a transformative approach to hospitality design and service delivery, fostering a deeper connection between guests and their environments while promoting sustainable practices.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has undergone significant evolution, transitioning from artisanal techniques to modern manufacturing, while the guest experience domain has increasingly prioritized personalization and sustainability. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, creating a new paradigm that leverages the aesthetic and cultural significance of textiles to enhance the guest experience in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from textile design and hospitality management to propose a framework that addresses contemporary challenges in both fields. By focusing on sustainability, personalization, and cultural integration, the dissertation aims to contribute valuable knowledge to both academia and industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from the fabric industry enhance the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of personalized textile choices on guest satisfaction and brand loyalty?
3. How can sustainable textile practices be effectively integrated into hospitality operations?
