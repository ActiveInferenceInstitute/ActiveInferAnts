# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) with Neuroscience, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that enhances our understanding of brain function and health. By examining the isomorphisms between these two domains, this research seeks to establish new theoretical constructs, methodologies, and practical applications that can revolutionize both fields. The significance of this work lies in its potential to inform therapeutic practices, educational paradigms, and community health initiatives, ultimately fostering a holistic approach to neuroscience that embraces cultural diversity and ecological sustainability.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Neuroscience represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding cognitive processes. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainability, holistic understanding, and cultural identity. Neuroscience, on the other hand, focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the brain and its functions. By transposing principles of TK into the neuroscience framework, we can explore the interconnectedness of ecological health, cultural practices, and cognitive function.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the reductionist paradigms prevalent in neuroscience by introducing holistic perspectives derived from TK. The novelty lies in the development of integrated theoretical models that bridge these two domains, offering fresh insights into neuroplasticity, memory encoding, and community health. This dissertation will contribute to both academic knowledge and practical applications in mental health and education.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How do cultural practices influence neural plasticity and cognitive function?
- What role does community play in shaping neurodevelopment and mental health?
- How can insights from TK inform interventions for neurodegenerative diseases?
- What are the neural correlates of traditional storytelling and its impact on memory?
- To develop a comprehensive framework that integrates TK with neuroscience for educational and therapeutic practices.
