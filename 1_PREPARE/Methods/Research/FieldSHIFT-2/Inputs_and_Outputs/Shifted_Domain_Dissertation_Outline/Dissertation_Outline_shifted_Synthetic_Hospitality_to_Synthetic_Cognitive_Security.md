# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience from the hospitality industry and cognitive security, proposing a transformative framework that enhances individual resilience against cognitive threats. By integrating principles from both domains, this research seeks to establish a new paradigm—Cognitive Experience (CEx)—that prioritizes user engagement, personalization, and information quality. The findings have the potential to revolutionize cognitive security practices, influence educational curricula, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more secure and informed society.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on holistic interactions, personalization, and service quality. Conversely, cognitive security has emerged as a critical field dedicated to protecting individuals from misinformation and cognitive manipulation. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, establishing a comprehensive framework that redefines cognitive security as an experiential journey.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel perspective on cognitive security by applying guest experience principles. It challenges traditional paradigms, suggesting that cognitive security should not merely focus on threats but also on enhancing user experiences. This innovative approach has the potential to reshape how organizations and individuals interact with information systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be transposed into cognitive security?
2. What is the proposed Cognitive Experience framework, and how does it enhance user resilience against cognitive threats?
3. How can personalized cognitive security solutions be developed without compromising user privacy?
4. What metrics can be established for assessing information quality in a manner analogous to service quality in hospitality?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
