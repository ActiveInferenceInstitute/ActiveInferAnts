# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Guest Experience Principles into Cognitive Security Strategies

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Guest Experience and Cognitive Security, creating a novel framework that leverages principles from hospitality to enhance cognitive resilience against misinformation. By developing an integrated approach that emphasizes personalization, quality assurance, and ethical considerations, this research seeks to establish a comprehensive model for cognitive security that prioritizes individual engagement and societal trust. The potential impact of this work extends to both academic discourse and practical applications in various sectors, including education, technology, and public policy.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a transformative fusion of Guest Experience—rooted in hospitality and service management—and Cognitive Security, focused on protecting individuals from misinformation and cognitive manipulation. This dissertation will analyze how principles from one domain can enrich the other, creating a holistic framework for cognitive security that emphasizes user engagement and trust.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
Despite the growing concerns surrounding misinformation and cognitive threats, current cognitive security strategies lack the personalization and quality assurance found in guest experience management. This research addresses the critical gap by proposing a model that integrates these elements, thereby enhancing both individual resilience and public trust.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be effectively transposed into cognitive security frameworks?
2. What new models and metrics can be developed to assess cognitive engagement and information integrity?
3. How can personalized cognitive security training programs improve resilience against misinformation?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Guest Experience:** Evolution from traditional hospitality practices to modern service management, emphasizing personalization and technology integration.
- **Cognitive Security:** Emergence as a response to the digital age's challenges, focusing on misinformation, cognitive biases, and social engineering.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Guest Experience:** Emphasis on holistic interaction, service quality, and sustainability.
- **Cognitive Security:** Focus on misinformation detection, cognitive biases, and ethical considerations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integrated strategies that combine psychological insights with practical applications in cognitive security.
- Opportunities to enhance cognitive resilience through personalized approaches derived from guest experience principles.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service Quality Models:** Frameworks such as SERVQUAL that assess service delivery and customer satisfaction.
- **Cognitive Psychology Theories:** Insights into cognitive biases, misinformation processing, and decision-making.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cognitive Engagement Model (CEM):** A framework that maps cognitive interactions with information sources.
- **Personalized Cognitive Resilience Training (PCRT):** A tailored approach to enhancing individual resilience against cognitive threats.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- An integrated model combining service quality principles with cognitive security strategies to enhance information integrity and user engagement.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to gather comprehensive data on user experiences and cognitive vulnerabilities.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** Assessing individual experiences with misinformation and cognitive security awareness.
- **Interviews:** Conducting in-depth discussions with experts in hospitality and cognitive security.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis:** Identifying key themes from qualitative data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilizing regression models to analyze survey data and test hypotheses.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality and informed consent, particularly when discussing sensitive topics related to cognitive vulnerabilities.
