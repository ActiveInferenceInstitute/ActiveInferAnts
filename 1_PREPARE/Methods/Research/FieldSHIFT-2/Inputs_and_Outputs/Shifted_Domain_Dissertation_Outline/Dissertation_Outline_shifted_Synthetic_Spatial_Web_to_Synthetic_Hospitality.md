The significance of this research lies in its pioneering approach to integrating advanced technologies into the hospitality sector. By investigating the interplay between digital and physical experiences, this study aims to uncover new methodologies for enhancing guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The novelty of this research stems from its interdisciplinary nature, drawing insights from technology, hospitality management, and data analytics to create a cohesive framework for improving guest experiences.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can augmented reality enhance guest engagement and satisfaction in hospitality settings?
2. In what ways can IoT devices optimize guest comfort and operational efficiency?
3. How can geospatial data analytics inform resource allocation and service delivery in hospitality?
4. What role does blockchain technology play in ensuring privacy and transparency in guest interactions?

The objectives of this dissertation include:
- Developing a comprehensive theoretical framework integrating the Spatial Web with guest experience management.
- Conducting empirical research to test the proposed hypotheses.
- Providing actionable recommendations for hospitality businesses to implement these technologies effectively.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Spatial Web
The Spatial Web has evolved from earlier concepts of augmented reality and the Internet of Things, which focused on enhancing user interactions through digital overlays and interconnected devices. Key milestones include the development of AR applications for navigation and gaming, as well as the rise of IoT technologies that facilitate real-time data sharing.

### Guest Experience
Historically, guest experience management has centered on service quality and personalization. The emergence of technology in hospitality has shifted this focus, introducing new tools for enhancing service delivery and guest satisfaction, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems and mobile applications.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Spatial Web
Current research in the Spatial Web emphasizes the potential of AR and IoT in various industries, including retail and education. However, there is limited exploration of its application in hospitality, presenting a unique opportunity for investigation.

### Guest Experience
The hospitality industry has increasingly adopted technology to improve guest experiences, yet there remains a gap in understanding how emerging technologies can be systematically integrated to create a holistic guest experience.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of the Spatial Web and guest experience reveals several gaps in the literature, including:
- Lack of comprehensive models that integrate digital technologies into guest experience management.
- Insufficient empirical research on the effectiveness of AR, IoT, and blockchain in enhancing hospitality services.
- Need for frameworks that address the ethical implications of data use in guest interactions.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Theories of Augmented Reality
- **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)**: Explains how users come to accept and use new technologies.
- **User Experience (UX) Design Principles**: Focus on creating user-centric designs that enhance engagement.

### Theories of Guest Experience
- **Service Quality Models**: Such as the SERVQUAL model, which assesses service quality based on dimensions like reliability and responsiveness.
- **Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory**: Explains how guest satisfaction is influenced by the comparison of expected and perceived service.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Integrated Experience Framework
This framework combines elements from the Spatial Web and guest experience theories to propose a model that emphasizes the interconnectedness of digital and physical experiences in hospitality.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model outlines the relationships between AR, IoT, geospatial analytics, and blockchain in enhancing guest experience, emphasizing the importance of personalization, service quality, and transparency.
