# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Spatial Web into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Spatial Web—a fusion of physical and digital environments—into non-science ways of knowing, which encompass intuitive, traditional, and culturally-based knowledge systems. By establishing a framework termed "Contextual Augmentation," this research seeks to enhance the understanding and retention of cultural narratives through immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize educational methodologies, foster cross-cultural empathy, and create innovative solutions to contemporary issues by respecting and incorporating diverse knowledge systems. Ultimately, the dissertation will contribute to the emerging field of interdisciplinary studies, enriching both the Spatial Web and non-science knowledge domains.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift in how individuals interact with their environments, merging physical and digital realities through advanced technologies. Non-science ways of knowing, on the other hand, provide rich, context-driven insights that have historically been undervalued in empirical research. The intersection of these domains opens up new avenues for understanding human experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between scientific and non-scientific knowledge, proposing a new model that respects and enhances cultural understanding through technological integration. The novelty lies in the application of Spatial Web technologies to enrich non-scientific knowledge systems, creating a framework that bridges gaps between these previously distinct fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Spatial Web technologies enhance the retention and understanding of non-science ways of knowing?
2. What are the implications of integrating these technologies into educational practices?
3. How can this integration foster cross-cultural empathy and understanding?
