# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying the Free Energy Principle to Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and traditional knowledge systems, establishing a novel framework that positions indigenous practices as adaptive strategies for ecological sustainability. By integrating concepts from cognitive science and ecology, this research seeks to demonstrate how traditional knowledge embodies principles of active inference, generative modeling, and variational free energy minimization. The findings will have significant implications for both academic discourse and practical applications in sustainability, environmental policy, and cultural preservation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle, developed primarily within cognitive science and theoretical biology, posits that adaptive systems, including living organisms, strive to minimize prediction errors in their interactions with the environment. Traditional knowledge, on the other hand, encapsulates the ecological wisdom and practices of indigenous communities that have evolved over generations. This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these two domains, revealing how traditional knowledge can be understood through the lens of the FEP.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it transcends conventional boundaries between scientific inquiry and indigenous wisdom, offering a fresh perspective on sustainability and adaptation. By framing traditional knowledge as a sophisticated system of active inference and generative modeling, this dissertation aims to validate the effectiveness of indigenous practices in contemporary ecological contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to understand traditional knowledge systems?
2. In what ways do traditional knowledge practices function as adaptive responses to ecological dynamics?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of FEP and traditional knowledge?
