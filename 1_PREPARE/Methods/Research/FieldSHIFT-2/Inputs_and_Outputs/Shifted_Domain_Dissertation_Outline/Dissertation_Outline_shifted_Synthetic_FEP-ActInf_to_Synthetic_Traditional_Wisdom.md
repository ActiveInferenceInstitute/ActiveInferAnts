# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Free Energy Principle & Active Inference Applied to Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with Traditional Knowledge (TK). By examining the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research will uncover novel insights into adaptive systems, ecological resilience, and the sustainability of indigenous practices. The significance of this research lies in its capacity to bridge modern scientific theories with age-old wisdom, creating a comprehensive framework that can inform both ecological management and cultural preservation. The potential impact extends to policy-making, educational reform, and the development of innovative technologies that respect and incorporate traditional ecological practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that living organisms strive to minimize prediction errors in their interactions with the environment. Traditional Knowledge, on the other hand, embodies the collective wisdom of indigenous communities regarding sustainable practices and ecological management. This dissertation seeks to synthesize these two domains, revealing their interconnectedness and mutual benefits.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel as it presents a framework that combines cutting-edge scientific theories with traditional ecological wisdom. By doing so, it not only elevates the status of traditional knowledge in contemporary discourse but also provides a scientific basis for its application in modern ecological practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of FEP and Active Inference be applied to understand and enhance Traditional Knowledge systems?
2. What are the ecological and cultural implications of integrating these two domains?
3. How can this integration inform sustainable resource management practices?
