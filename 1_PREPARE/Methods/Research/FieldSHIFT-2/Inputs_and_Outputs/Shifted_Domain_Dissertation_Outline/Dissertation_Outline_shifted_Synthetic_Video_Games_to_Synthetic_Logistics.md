By examining the core tenets of both domains, the research identifies isomorphisms and develops novel hypotheses aimed at optimizing logistics processes. The potential impact of this work extends to redefining user experiences in logistics, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and paving the way for new sub-disciplines. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also offer practical applications that can revolutionize the logistics industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of game design and logistics represents a pioneering approach to solving longstanding challenges in the logistics sector. Game design emphasizes user experience, engagement, and iterative feedback, while logistics focuses on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction. This dissertation investigates how the principles of game design can be transposed into logistics to create a more dynamic, user-centric framework.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to bridge gaps between two traditionally distinct fields, offering fresh perspectives and methodologies. By applying game design principles to logistics, the dissertation aims to enhance customer engagement and operational efficiency while addressing contemporary challenges such as last-mile delivery inefficiencies and supply chain disruptions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into logistics processes?
2. What are the potential impacts of gamification on customer engagement and satisfaction in logistics?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
