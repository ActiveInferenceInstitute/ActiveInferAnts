# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from Biology to Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating biological principles into health care, creating a novel framework known as the "Patient Ecosystem Model." This interdisciplinary approach seeks to enhance patient experience, optimize health outcomes, and foster collaboration among healthcare providers. By examining the interplay between biological concepts and healthcare practices, this research has the potential to revolutionize patient care, inform policy, and contribute to the emergence of new sub-disciplines within health care.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of biology and health care presents an innovative lens through which to examine patient interactions, health outcomes, and service delivery. Traditional health care models often overlook the dynamic relationships between various elements within the healthcare ecosystem, which can be better understood through biological principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it establishes a new paradigm for understanding health care through the lens of biology. By applying ecological, population, and cellular concepts, the dissertation aims to create a cohesive framework that enhances patient-centered care and addresses systemic challenges within health care.
