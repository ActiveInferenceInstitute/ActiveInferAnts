# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing principles of logistics into non-science ways of knowing. By integrating structured methodologies from logistics with holistic, experiential, and culturally-rooted approaches, this research seeks to create a new framework that enhances personal and communal understanding, optimizes emotional experiences, and fosters resilience. The significance of this work lies in its interdisciplinary nature, offering novel insights that can revolutionize educational practices, community engagement, and emotional well-being. The impact of this research extends beyond academia, presenting opportunities for practical applications in various sectors, including education, healthcare, and community development.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of logistics—focused on the efficient movement and management of goods—and non-science ways of knowing, which emphasize intuition, experience, and cultural narratives. This synthesis allows for a deeper understanding of how structured methodologies can inform and enhance personal and community growth.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges conventional boundaries between empirical and experiential knowledge. By applying logistics principles to emotional and cultural management, it offers a fresh perspective on personal fulfillment and community well-being, addressing gaps in both fields and promoting a more inclusive understanding of human experience.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can logistics principles be effectively transposed into non-science ways of knowing?
2. What new frameworks can emerge from this integration to enhance emotional and cultural management?
3. What are the implications of these frameworks for education, community resilience, and individual well-being?
