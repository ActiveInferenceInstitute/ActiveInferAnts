# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the Shifted Domain that merges Traditional Knowledge with Cognitive Security. By investigating the interplay between community-driven traditional practices and modern cognitive resilience strategies, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances societal resilience against misinformation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform educational practices, technological innovations, and community engagement strategies that can effectively combat cognitive threats while honoring and integrating indigenous wisdom. The expected impact includes fostering a more informed citizenry, strengthening community ties, and creating sustainable practices for information management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative convergence of Traditional Knowledge—rooted in the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities—and Cognitive Security, which focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation. This intersection allows for a holistic understanding of information integrity, emphasizing cultural practices and community engagement as vital components in addressing contemporary cognitive threats.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only fills existing gaps in both fields but also offers a novel perspective on cognitive resilience. By leveraging the strengths of traditional knowledge systems, this dissertation aims to propose integrative strategies that enhance community awareness and critical thinking, thereby creating a robust defense against misinformation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of traditional knowledge be integrated into cognitive security frameworks?
2. What role does community engagement play in enhancing cognitive resilience?
3. How can cultural practices be adapted to foster critical thinking and media literacy?
