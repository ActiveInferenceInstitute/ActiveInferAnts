# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) with Non-Science Ways of Knowing (NSWOK). The proposed research will investigate how the fusion of these two domains can enhance understanding and practices in environmental management, healthcare, and education. By developing an integrated theoretical framework and innovative methodologies, this dissertation seeks to address existing gaps in knowledge production, promote cultural sensitivity, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The anticipated impact includes improved biodiversity conservation strategies, enhanced mental health outcomes, and the establishment of new pedagogical approaches that value diverse epistemologies.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of Traditional Knowledge and Non-Science Ways of Knowing represents a paradigm shift in understanding knowledge production. TK, characterized by its deep connection to the environment and holistic worldview, contrasts with the often reductionist approaches of scientific inquiry. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can complement each other to create a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the hierarchical view of knowledge systems, advocating for the inclusion of diverse epistemologies in addressing global challenges. The novelty lies in creating a framework that not only values TK but also redefines the role of non-scientific knowledge in contemporary research and practice.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Knowledge be effectively integrated into Non-Science Ways of Knowing?
2. What are the implications of this integration for environmental management, healthcare, and education?
3. How can we develop a new lexicon and theoretical framework that supports this transposition?
