# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystem Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of biological ecosystem concepts with guest experience in the hospitality industry. By examining the interdependence, biodiversity, energy flow, resilience, and keystone behaviors from ecology, this research will develop a theoretical framework that enhances guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The potential impact of this work extends beyond hospitality, offering insights for sustainability practices and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately transforming the way guest experiences are designed and delivered.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experience through service quality and personalization. However, the increasing demand for sustainability and innovation necessitates a new perspective. By applying principles from biological ecosystems, we can understand how interdependencies and diversity within service offerings can enhance guest experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two previously distinct fieldsâ€”biology and hospitality. By integrating ecological concepts into hospitality management, this dissertation will provide a novel approach to understanding guest interactions and operational strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of interdependence and biodiversity from ecosystems enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of energy flow and resilience in service delivery?
3. How can keystone behaviors among staff influence guest satisfaction?
4. To develop a comprehensive model of guest ecosystems that can be applied across the hospitality sector.
