# PhD Dissertation Plan: Ecosystem Principles in Hospitality Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of ecosystem principles into hospitality management, a Shifted Domain that promises to revolutionize guest experience and operational efficiency. By examining the interconnectedness, biodiversity, and resilience within hospitality settings, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive model that enhances service delivery and fosters sustainable practices. The anticipated impact includes improved guest satisfaction, increased brand loyalty, and the establishment of hospitality as a leader in adaptive service delivery. This work not only fills existing gaps in hospitality research but also contributes significantly to the fields of ecosystem science and management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges ecosystem principles—such as interconnectedness and resilience—with hospitality management, focusing on guest experience. This interdisciplinary approach recognizes that hospitality operations can be viewed as dynamic ecosystems, where various components interact to create holistic guest experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its potential to redefine hospitality management practices by applying ecological theories to enhance operational effectiveness and guest satisfaction. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecological concepts to address contemporary challenges in hospitality, such as service quality and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecosystem principles be applied to enhance guest experience in hospitality management?
2. What role do keystone staff and service biodiversity play in operational resilience?
3. How can feedback mechanisms be optimized to improve service quality?
