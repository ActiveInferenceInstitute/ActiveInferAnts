# Literature Review
## Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of entomology and Hymenoptera studies has paralleled advancements in ecological and biological sciences. Early observations have transitioned into rigorous methodologies, with a focus on biodiversity conservation and the ecological roles of insects.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research highlights the importance of Hymenoptera in pollination and ecosystem services, while entomology emphasizes the necessity of understanding insect interactions and adaptations. However, both fields face challenges such as declining populations and habitat loss.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
There is a limited understanding of the full ecological impact of Hymenoptera declines, as well as a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects entomology with Hymenopteran studies. This presents an opportunity for innovative research that bridges these gaps.
