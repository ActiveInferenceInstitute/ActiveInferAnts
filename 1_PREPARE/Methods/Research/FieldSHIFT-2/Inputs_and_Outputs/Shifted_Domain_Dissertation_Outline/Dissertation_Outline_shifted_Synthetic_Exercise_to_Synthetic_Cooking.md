# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: From Exercise to Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of exercise science and culinary arts, termed the Shifted Domain. By integrating principles of exercise into cuisine, the research seeks to redefine nutritional practices, enhance health outcomes, and promote holistic well-being. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize both culinary education and health promotion strategies, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and practical applications. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the transformative potential of this integration, offering a roadmap for future research and practical implementations.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of exercise science and culinary arts, recognizing the importance of physical activity and nutrition in achieving optimal health. This integration acknowledges that both domains share foundational principles, such as balance, adaptation, and personalization, which can be synergistically applied to enhance overall well-being.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional perceptions of cuisine as merely a source of sustenance, proposing instead that it can serve as a dynamic tool for health improvement. By applying exercise principles to culinary practices, this dissertation introduces a new paradigm that emphasizes the importance of flavor, health, and adaptability in cooking.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of exercise science be effectively integrated into culinary practices to promote health?
2. What are the implications of this integration for culinary education and public health?
3. How can new culinary paradigms enhance individual and community well-being?
