This research aims to articulate how personalized, progressive, and wellness-centric approaches can transform guest satisfaction and loyalty. By examining the intersections of these two domains, the dissertation seeks to contribute to both academic knowledge and practical applications within hospitality, ultimately impacting guest experiences and industry standards.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain of Exercise to Guest Experience represents an innovative fusion of exercise science and hospitality management. Historically, exercise science has focused on physical health and performance, while guest experience in hospitality has centered around service quality and customer satisfaction. This dissertation aims to bridge the gap between these two fields by applying exercise principles to enhance guest experiences.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel framework for understanding guest experiences through the lens of exercise science. It offers unprecedented opportunities for personalized service delivery and wellness integration, addressing contemporary challenges in the hospitality industry, such as rising guest expectations and the need for differentiation in a competitive market.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of exercise science be applied to enhance guest experiences in the hospitality industry?
2. What are the impacts of personalized wellness programs on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. In what ways can progressive engagement strategies transform guest interactions?

# Literature Review
