# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of cuisine and game design, termed the Shifted Domain. By analyzing the core principles and methodologies of both fields, this research aims to identify isomorphisms that can enhance game design through culinary concepts. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize player engagement, cultural representation in games, and the overall gaming experience. The findings could lead to new pedagogical approaches in game design education, practical applications in the gaming industry, and interdisciplinary collaborations that foster cultural understanding.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between two traditionally distinct fields: cuisine, with its rich cultural significance and sensory experiences, and game design, focused on player engagement and immersive storytelling. This dissertation aims to systematically explore how culinary principles can inform and enhance game design practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to create a new paradigm in game design that emphasizes cultural narratives and sensory experiences. By leveraging the rich traditions of cuisine, game designers can create more engaging and meaningful experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can culinary principles be transposed into game design to enhance player engagement?
2. What are the potential impacts of integrating cultural narratives into gameplay?
3. How can sensory elements from cuisine inform the design of immersive game experiences?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Cuisine
- Evolution of culinary practices influenced by trade, migration, and technology.
- The role of cuisine in cultural identity and social norms.

### Game Design
- Historical evolution from early video games to complex interactive experiences.
- The emergence of diverse genres and player expectations.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Cuisine
- Current trends emphasize sustainability, health, and culinary fusion.

### Game Design
- Rapid technological advancements and their impact on game mechanics and player experiences.
- Ethical considerations in monetization and player engagement.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Limited exploration of cultural narratives in game design.
- Underutilization of sensory experiences in enhancing player immersion.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Cuisine
- Cultural anthropology and the significance of food in society.
- Sensory perception theories related to taste and aroma.

### Game Design
- Game mechanics and player engagement theories.
- Narrative theory and its application in interactive media.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- The concept of "Flavor Mechanics" as a framework for integrating layered gameplay.
- The idea of "Cultural Narrative" as a means to enhance player connection to the game.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines culinary principles with game design frameworks, focusing on cultural narratives, sensory experiences, and gameplay mechanics.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of culinary principles into game design.

## Data Collection Methods

- Surveys and interviews with game designers and culinary experts.
- Playtesting of games designed with culinary principles.

## Analytical Approaches

- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to identify common themes.
- Statistical analysis of player engagement metrics from playtests.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and addressing potential biases in data collection.
