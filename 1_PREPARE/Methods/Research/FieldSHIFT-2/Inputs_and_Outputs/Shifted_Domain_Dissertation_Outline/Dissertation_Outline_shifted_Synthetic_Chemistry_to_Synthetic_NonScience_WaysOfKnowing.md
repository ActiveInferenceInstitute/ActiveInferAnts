# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemistry to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of chemistry and non-science ways of knowing, creating a Shifted Domain that provides a new lens through which to understand personal transformation, mentorship, emotional equilibrium, and cultural identity. By systematically transposing core elements of chemistry into the realm of human experience, this research will generate novel hypotheses and models that can revolutionize educational practices, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and promote holistic understanding. The anticipated impact spans across academia, industry, and society, offering fresh insights into the interconnectedness of scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between chemistry—a rigorous scientific discipline focused on the properties and interactions of matter—and non-science ways of knowing, which encompass intuitive, experiential, and culturally rooted forms of understanding. This dissertation will delve into how principles from chemistry can illuminate and enhance our comprehension of personal and cultural dynamics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering a transformative framework that challenges conventional boundaries of knowledge. The novelty lies in the application of scientific principles to non-scientific contexts, creating a rich tapestry of understanding that respects and incorporates diverse perspectives.
