# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Chemistry to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of chemistry—a traditionally empirical and quantitative scientific discipline—with non-science ways of knowing, which include intuitive, experiential, and cultural knowledge systems. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine educational practices, enhance community resilience, and promote holistic approaches to complex global challenges. By identifying isomorphisms between chemical processes and personal transformations, this dissertation will develop a comprehensive theoretical framework and practical applications that bridge these two domains, ultimately contributing to an enriched understanding of human experience.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of chemistry and non-science ways of knowing represents a novel approach to understanding human experience and societal dynamics. Chemistry, with its rigorous methodologies and focus on empirical evidence, contrasts sharply with the subjective and often qualitative nature of non-science knowledge. This dissertation seeks to elucidate how these two seemingly disparate fields can inform and enrich each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional dichotomies between science and non-science, advocating for an integrative perspective that acknowledges the value of diverse knowledge systems. The novelty of this dissertation lies in its interdisciplinary approach, proposing a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that facilitate the integration of these domains.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from chemistry be applied to enhance understanding and validation of non-science ways of knowing?
2. What is the role of mentorship and cultural narratives in personal and communal transformation?
3. How can the integration of these domains inform educational practices and policy-making?
