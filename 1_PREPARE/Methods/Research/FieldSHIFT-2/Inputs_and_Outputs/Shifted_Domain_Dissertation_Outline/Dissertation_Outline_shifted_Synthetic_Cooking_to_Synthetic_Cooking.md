# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts from Cuisine to Nutrition Science

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of culinary arts and nutrition science, proposing a transformative framework that integrates cultural culinary practices with nutritional education. By examining the synergies between these two fields, this research seeks to develop culturally relevant dietary guidelines, enhance the appeal of healthy eating through flavor, and incorporate culinary techniques into nutrition education. The potential impact of this research is significant, as it addresses the challenges of dietary adherence and health outcomes in diverse populations, fostering a holistic understanding of food that celebrates both its nutritional value and cultural significance.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of culinary arts and nutrition science represents a novel approach to dietary education that recognizes the importance of cultural context and flavor in promoting healthy eating. Cuisine is not merely a collection of recipes; it embodies cultural identity, history, and social practices. Conversely, nutrition science focuses on the biochemical and physiological aspects of food and its impact on health. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, creating a comprehensive understanding that enhances dietary practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional nutrition education paradigms that often overlook cultural relevance and flavor. By integrating culinary concepts into nutrition science, this dissertation proposes a new lexicon and framework that can improve dietary adherence and health outcomes. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which opens new avenues for understanding food and nutrition.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary practices enhance the effectiveness of nutrition education?
2. In what ways does cultural relevance influence dietary adherence and health outcomes?
3. What role do flavor and cooking techniques play in promoting the consumption of nutrient-dense foods?
4. How can an integrated curriculum in culinary nutrition be developed to enhance education in both fields?

## Literature Review
