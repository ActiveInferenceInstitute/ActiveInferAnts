# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating concepts from **RxInfer.jl**, a probabilistic programming framework, into the field of negotiation. By establishing a Shifted Domain that fuses advanced probabilistic modeling techniques with negotiation strategies, this research seeks to address significant gaps in both domains and propose innovative methodologies for enhancing negotiation outcomes. The findings are expected to have profound implications for academia, industry practices, and policy-making, ultimately redefining how negotiations are approached in various contexts.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The integration of probabilistic programming, particularly through RxInfer.jl, with negotiation presents a unique opportunity to enhance decision-making processes. This Shifted Domain leverages concepts such as message passing, constrained Forney Factor Graphs, and active inference to create structured frameworks for negotiation, which traditionally relies on interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges the conventional understanding of negotiation by introducing data-driven methodologies. The novelty lies in the application of probabilistic programming principles to improve communication dynamics, decision-making, and outcome prediction in negotiations. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches both fields but also opens new avenues for practical applications.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can message-passing frameworks enhance communication and information flow in negotiation?
2. What impact do constrained negotiation graphs have on the clarity and satisfaction of negotiation outcomes?
3. How can active inference models predict and improve negotiation strategies based on real-time feedback?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of probabilistic programming has been marked by advancements in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, leading to tools like RxInfer.jl. Similarly, the study of negotiation has progressed from simple tactics to a complex understanding of psychological and cultural factors influencing outcomes.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in probabilistic programming emphasizes its application in various domains, while negotiation studies focus on strategies, emotional intelligence, and cultural awareness. However, there is limited exploration of how these two fields can intersect.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The primary gap lies in the lack of structured, data-driven approaches to negotiation. This Shifted Domain provides opportunities to develop frameworks that can enhance negotiation strategies, improve decision-making, and facilitate better outcomes through the application of probabilistic modeling techniques.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Bayesian Inference**: A statistical method that updates the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.
- **Game Theory**: A mathematical framework for modeling strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Negotiation Graph Theory**: A new theoretical construct that models negotiations as graphical representations of interests, constraints, and communication pathways.
- **Active Negotiation Framework**: An evolving model that incorporates real-time feedback and adaptive strategies based on ongoing interactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will combine Bayesian inference, game theory, and negotiation graph theory to create a comprehensive framework for understanding and improving negotiation processes.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the integration of probabilistic programming into negotiation.

## Data Collection Methods

- **Surveys**: To gather data on negotiation strategies and outcomes from practitioners.
- **Experiments**: Role-playing simulations to test the effectiveness of structured negotiation frameworks.
- **Case Studies**: In-depth analyses of real-world negotiations utilizing the proposed frameworks.

## Analytical Approaches

- **Statistical Analysis**: To evaluate the impact of structured frameworks on negotiation outcomes.
- **Network Analysis**: To visualize and analyze communication dynamics within negotiation contexts.

## Ethical Considerations

The research will adhere to ethical guidelines concerning participant consent, data privacy, and the integrity of the negotiation process.
