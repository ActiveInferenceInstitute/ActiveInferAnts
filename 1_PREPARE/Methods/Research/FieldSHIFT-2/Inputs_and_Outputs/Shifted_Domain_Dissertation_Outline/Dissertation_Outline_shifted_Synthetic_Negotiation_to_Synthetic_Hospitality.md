By applying negotiation strategies to the guest experience, this study will fill existing gaps in the literature and provide a fresh perspective on service excellence. The novelty of the research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from negotiation theory and guest experience management to create a comprehensive framework for improving hospitality services.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into the guest experience framework?
2. What impact do negotiation skills have on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. What are the potential challenges and limitations of applying negotiation techniques in hospitality settings?

The objectives of this dissertation include:
- To develop an integrated theoretical model that links negotiation principles to guest experience.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Negotiation
Negotiation has evolved from a purely transactional process to a more relational approach, emphasizing collaboration and mutual benefit. Key historical milestones include the development of negotiation theories such as the Harvard Negotiation Project and the emergence of integrative bargaining strategies.

### Guest Experience
The concept of guest experience has gained prominence in the hospitality industry, evolving from basic service delivery to a holistic approach that encompasses all touchpoints in the guest journey. Key historical developments include the introduction of customer relationship management (CRM) systems and the increasing importance of personalization in service delivery.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Negotiation
Current research in negotiation emphasizes the importance of emotional intelligence, cultural sensitivity, and ethical considerations. Scholars have explored various negotiation strategies, including collaborative approaches and the role of technology in facilitating negotiations.

### Guest Experience
The guest experience literature highlights the significance of service quality, emotional connections, and the role of technology in shaping guest interactions. Recent studies have focused on the impact of personalization and the importance of understanding guest preferences and expectations.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the rich literature in both fields, there is a lack of research exploring the intersection of negotiation and guest experience. Key gaps include:
- The absence of frameworks that integrate negotiation principles into hospitality practices.
- Limited empirical studies examining the impact of negotiation skills on guest satisfaction and loyalty.
- A need for practical applications of negotiation techniques in service recovery and conflict resolution.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Negotiation Theories
- **Interest-Based Negotiation**: Focuses on understanding the underlying interests of parties to reach mutually beneficial agreements.
- **Dual Concern Model**: Balances concern for self and concern for others in negotiation contexts.

### Guest Experience Theories
- **Service Quality Model**: Evaluates service delivery based on dimensions such as reliability, responsiveness, and empathy.
- **Experience Economy**: Emphasizes the importance of memorable experiences in driving guest satisfaction and loyalty.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Negotiation-Enhanced Guest Experience (NEGE)**: A framework that combines negotiation principles with guest experience management.
- **Emotional Intelligence in Service (EIS)**: The application of emotional intelligence principles to enhance guest interactions.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated theoretical model will illustrate the interconnections between negotiation principles and guest experience elements, highlighting how skills such as active listening, empathy, and emotional management can be applied to improve service delivery and guest satisfaction.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

This dissertation will employ a mixed-methods research design, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to gather comprehensive data on the impact of negotiation principles on guest experience.

## Data Collection Methods

1. **Surveys**: Administer surveys to hospitality staff and guests to assess perceptions of negotiation-enhanced interactions and their impact on satisfaction.
2. **Interviews**: Conduct in-depth interviews with industry experts and hospitality professionals to gather insights on best practices and challenges in implementing negotiation techniques.
3. **Case Studies**: Analyze case studies of hospitality organizations that have successfully integrated negotiation principles into their service delivery.

## Analytical Approaches

- **Quantitative Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze survey data and identify correlations between negotiation skills and guest satisfaction metrics.
- **Qualitative Analysis**: Employ thematic analysis to interpret interview and case study data, identifying common themes and insights related to the integration of negotiation principles.

## Ethical Considerations

This research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent from participants, confidentiality of data, and the responsible reporting of findings.
