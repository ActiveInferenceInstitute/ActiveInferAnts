# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative integration of non-science ways of knowing into the field of logistics, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes holistic understanding, cultural narratives, and emotional intelligence. The research aims to address current challenges in logistics, such as sustainability and stakeholder engagement, by proposing innovative methodologies that blend subjective experiences with traditional logistics practices. The potential impact of this research extends beyond logistics, influencing interdisciplinary fields and promoting socially responsible practices that resonate with diverse communities.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of non-science ways of knowing—such as cultural narratives, emotional intelligence, and experiential learning—with the traditionally data-driven and efficiency-focused field of logistics. This integration challenges the conventional paradigms of logistics by emphasizing the importance of human factors, cultural contexts, and holistic understanding.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it paves the way for a new paradigm in logistics that values qualitative insights alongside quantitative data. By recognizing and incorporating non-science ways of knowing, the study seeks to enhance operational efficiency, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability practices within logistics.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance decision-making processes in logistics?
2. What impact do cultural narratives have on stakeholder engagement in logistics operations?
3. In what ways can emotional intelligence training improve leadership effectiveness within the logistics sector?

# Literature Review
## Historical Context of the Original Domains
The historical development of non-science ways of knowing has been shaped by diverse cultural practices, philosophical traditions, and spiritual beliefs, often contrasting with Western scientific paradigms. Logistics, on the other hand, has evolved as a discipline focused on the efficient movement of goods, heavily relying on quantitative analysis and technology.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature in logistics emphasizes optimization, cost reduction, and data-driven decision-making. In contrast, emerging research on non-science ways of knowing highlights the value of subjective experiences, storytelling, and emotional intelligence in understanding human behavior and societal norms.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The existing literature reveals a significant gap in the integration of non-science ways of knowing into logistics practices. This dissertation aims to bridge this gap by exploring how these alternative methodologies can address contemporary challenges in the logistics field.

# Theoretical Framework
## Foundational Theories from Original Domains
1. **Systems Theory**: Understanding logistics as a complex system of interdependent components.
2. **Decision Theory**: Analyzing decision-making processes within logistics, particularly under uncertainty.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
1. **Cultural Intelligence**: The ability to relate and work effectively across cultures in logistics contexts.
2. **Holistic Decision-Making**: A framework that incorporates both quantitative data and qualitative insights in logistics decision-making.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The proposed model integrates systems theory, decision theory, and cultural intelligence to create a comprehensive understanding of logistics that values both scientific and non-scientific ways of knowing.

# Methodology
## Research Design Overview
This research will adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing in logistics.

## Data Collection Methods
1. **Surveys**: Collect data on the perceptions and experiences of logistics professionals regarding non-science ways of knowing.
2. **Case Studies**: Conduct in-depth analyses of organizations that have successfully integrated non-science methodologies into their logistics practices.
3. **Interviews**: Engage with industry experts to gather insights on the practical implications of this integration.

## Analytical Approaches
1. **Qualitative Analysis**: Thematic analysis of interview and case study data to identify key themes and insights.
2. **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical analysis of survey data to measure the impact of non-science ways of knowing on logistics outcomes.

## Ethical Considerations
The research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and the respectful treatment of cultural knowledge.
