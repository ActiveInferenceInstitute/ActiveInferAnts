# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Concepts into the Context of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes an innovative exploration of the intersection between blockchain technology and the social behaviors of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps). By examining the decentralized decision-making processes and collective intelligence of these insects through the lens of blockchain principles, this research aims to uncover new insights into resource management, adaptability, and governance in biological systems. The potential impact of this work includes advancing our understanding of ecological dynamics, informing the development of decentralized technologies, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: blockchain technology, characterized by decentralized, secure, and transparent systems, and Hymenoptera, known for their complex social structures and cooperative behaviors. This intersection presents a unique opportunity to analyze and model biological phenomena using principles from computer science.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers the application of blockchain concepts to biological systems, offering a novel framework for understanding the dynamics of collective intelligence in social insects. By leveraging the principles of decentralization, consensus, and smart contracts, this dissertation aims to provide fresh perspectives on resource allocation and decision-making in Hymenoptera.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain principles enhance our understanding of collective decision-making in ant colonies?
2. What novel models can be developed to simulate pheromone-based smart contracts in Hymenoptera?
3. How can a tokenized resource allocation system inform ecological studies and improve colony efficiency?
