# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformational Domain Shift from William Blake's Life and Work to Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes an innovative exploration of the intersection between the artistic vision of William Blake and the scientific inquiry of astronomy. By examining how Blake's principles of imagination, duality, and interdisciplinary connections can inform and transform astronomical research and education, this study aims to redefine the boundaries of both fields. The potential impact of this research lies in fostering a more holistic understanding of the universe, enhancing public engagement with science through art, and inspiring new pedagogical approaches that integrate creativity into scientific inquiry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between the artistic philosophies of William Blake and the empirical methodologies of astronomy. Blake's work, characterized by its imaginative depth and exploration of dualities, offers a unique lens through which to view the cosmos, challenging conventional scientific paradigms.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes an interdisciplinary framework that merges artistic creativity with scientific rigor. By applying Blake's principles to astronomy, the study seeks to illuminate new pathways for inquiry, understanding, and public engagement, thereby creating a transformative impact on both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the concept of "cosmic imagination" enhance scientific inquiry in astronomy?
2. What insights can be gained from exploring the dualities present in cosmic phenomena through Blake's lens?
3. How can artistic methods be integrated into astronomical education and public outreach to foster greater understanding?
