# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Game Design Principles to Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between game design and astronomy, presenting a comprehensive framework that integrates game design principles into astronomical research and public engagement. By leveraging engagement strategies, feedback mechanisms, and iterative processes from game design, this research seeks to enhance the efficiency of astronomical inquiry and foster a deeper connection between the scientific community and the public. The potential impact of this work is significant, as it not only aims to improve research methodologies but also seeks to revolutionize public engagement in science, ultimately contributing to a more scientifically literate society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of game design and astronomy represents an unprecedented opportunity to apply established principles from a creative and user-centered domain to a traditionally empirical and observational field. Game design focuses on engagement, interactivity, and iterative refinement, while astronomy is grounded in observational data and theoretical modeling. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to transform both fields. By applying game design principles to astronomy, we aim to create new methodologies that enhance public engagement and streamline research processes. The novelty lies in the application of gamification to scientific inquiry, which has been largely unexplored in the context of astronomy.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
