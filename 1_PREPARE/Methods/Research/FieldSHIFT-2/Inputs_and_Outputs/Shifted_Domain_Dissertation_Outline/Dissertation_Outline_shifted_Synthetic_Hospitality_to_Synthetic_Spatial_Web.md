# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Guest Experience in Hospitality through the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore and analyze the intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality sector with the emerging Spatial Web, a digital frontier that integrates physical and virtual environments. By applying foundational concepts of personalization, service quality, and co-creation from hospitality to the Spatial Web, this research seeks to develop a new framework for enhancing user engagement and satisfaction in digital spaces. The potential impact of this study spans multiple domains, including tourism, urban planning, and technology, fostering innovative applications that resonate with users and address contemporary challenges in digital interactions.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long centered on guest experience, focusing on the quality of service and the emotional connection between guests and establishments. Meanwhile, the Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift in digital interaction, characterized by augmented reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies that blend physical and digital realities. This dissertation posits that merging these two domains can yield transformative insights and applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to synthesizing two distinct fields—hospitality and digital technology—into a cohesive framework that enhances user experiences. The significance lies in its potential to redefine how individuals engage with both physical and digital environments, offering new strategies for businesses and policymakers.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of guest experience in hospitality be effectively transposed to the Spatial Web?
- What frameworks can be developed to evaluate user satisfaction in digital interactions?
- What are the implications of this fusion for industries reliant on user experience?
