## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of blockchain technology with physical security is an emerging field that seeks to address the limitations of traditional security systems. Blockchain's decentralized nature offers a promising alternative to centralized security measures, which are often vulnerable to single points of failure and manipulation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a new paradigm for physical security, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and automation. By integrating blockchain technology, we can create systems that not only protect physical assets but also foster trust among stakeholders through tamper-proof records and collaborative incident reporting.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology enhance the resilience and effectiveness of physical security systems?
2. What are the implications of decentralized security frameworks for incident reporting and access control?
3. How can smart contracts be utilized to automate security protocols and improve response times?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
