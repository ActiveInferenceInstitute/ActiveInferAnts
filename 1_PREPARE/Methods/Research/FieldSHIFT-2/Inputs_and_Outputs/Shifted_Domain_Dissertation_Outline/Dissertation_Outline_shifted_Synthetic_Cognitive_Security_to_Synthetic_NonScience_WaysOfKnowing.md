# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Shifted Domain of Cognitive Security and Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles with non-science ways of knowing. By examining the intersections of these two distinct fields, the research will establish a novel framework for understanding and addressing the complexities of misinformation and knowledge dissemination in contemporary society. The significance of this study lies in its potential to foster resilience against cognitive threats while respecting and valuing diverse cultural perspectives and knowledge systems. The proposed research will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications, paving the way for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative solutions to global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Cognitive security focuses on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation and misinformation, while non-science ways of knowing encompass intuitive and culturally rooted methods of understanding. This dissertation will investigate how these domains can inform and enhance each other, creating a holistic approach to knowledge integrity and resilience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional dichotomy between scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems. By integrating cognitive security with non-science ways of knowing, the dissertation will provide a framework that enhances critical thinking, media literacy, and cultural respect, ultimately contributing to a more informed society.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be integrated into non-science educational frameworks to enhance resilience against misinformation?
2. What are the implications of merging cognitive security with non-science ways of knowing for community engagement and knowledge preservation?
3. How can interdisciplinary approaches foster innovative solutions to cognitive threats in diverse cultural contexts?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cognitive Security:** Emerged from the digital age's challenges, focusing on misinformation and cognitive threats.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Rooted in cultural traditions and experiential learning, often marginalized by scientific paradigms.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Cognitive Security:** Recent advancements in AI and machine learning for misinformation detection; emphasis on psychological insights.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Growing recognition of the value of integrating diverse knowledge systems in addressing global challenges.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that combine cognitive security with non-scientific knowledge.
- Opportunities for innovative educational programs that respect and integrate diverse cultural perspectives.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Cognitive Security:** Theories related to cognitive biases, misinformation, and resilience.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Theories of cultural knowledge, experiential learning, and ethical understanding.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cultural Cognitive Security:** A framework that integrates traditional knowledge systems into cognitive security strategies.
- **Holistic Knowledge Systems:** Models that combine empirical evidence with experiential and cultural wisdom.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The dissertation will propose an integrated model that illustrates the interplay between cognitive security and non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing resilience, cultural integrity, and community engagement.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of cognitive security and non-science ways of knowing.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with educators, community leaders, and cultural knowledge keepers.
- Case studies of successful initiatives that integrate cognitive security with non-scientific knowledge.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to identify key themes and insights.
- Statistical analysis of survey data to measure the effectiveness of integrated educational programs.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensure informed consent from all participants.
- Respect cultural sensitivities and confidentiality in data collection.
