# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of Buckminster Fuller’s visionary principles with contemporary logistics practices. By examining the intersections between Fuller's holistic design philosophy and the logistical frameworks of supply chain management, this research aims to develop a new paradigm for sustainable and efficient logistics. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform logistics into a more resilient and resource-conscious discipline, addressing pressing global challenges such as sustainability, efficiency, and adaptability. The anticipated impact extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal approaches to resource management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Fuller’s concepts with logistics represents a groundbreaking shift in how we perceive and manage supply chains. Fuller’s holistic thinking, ephemeralization, and principles of tensegrity provide a framework for reimagining logistics as an interconnected system that prioritizes sustainability and efficiency.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its application of Fuller's principles to logistics, a field traditionally focused on efficiency and cost-effectiveness without a comprehensive sustainability perspective. By integrating these concepts, the dissertation seeks to establish new methodologies and frameworks that can enhance logistical practices while addressing environmental concerns.
