# PhD Dissertation Plan: Traditional Knowledge and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a transformative framework that integrates indigenous wisdom with contemporary scientific paradigms. By examining the synergies between TK's ecological practices and holistic health systems and the FEP's principles of predictive processing and active inference, this research seeks to fill critical gaps in both fields. The potential impact includes enhanced ecological resilience, improved health outcomes, and the promotion of culturally sensitive practices in scientific research and policy-making.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel convergence of Traditional Knowledge—rooted in the wisdom of indigenous and local communities—and the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework from cognitive science and biology that describes how adaptive systems maintain their integrity. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can inform and enhance each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional boundaries between indigenous knowledge systems and scientific inquiry. By integrating TK with the FEP, we can uncover new insights into sustainability, health, and community resilience, fostering a more holistic understanding of human-environment interactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Traditional Knowledge inform the principles of the Free Energy Principle in ecological and health contexts?
- What are the implications of integrating TK into predictive models for ecological management and health outcomes?
- How can this interdisciplinary approach foster greater community resilience and adaptive capacity?
