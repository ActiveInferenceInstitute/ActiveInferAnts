# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Applying Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) to the Study of William Blake

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and the life and work of William Blake. By synthesizing methodologies from PME with Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions, this research seeks to uncover new insights into the relevance of Blake's themes in contemporary society. The potential impact of this study lies in its ability to bridge literary analysis with predictive frameworks, thereby fostering a deeper understanding of artistic expression and societal dynamics. The findings could revolutionize both Blake studies and the application of predictive methodologies in the humanities.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of PME and Blake studies represents a novel approach that leverages predictive analytics to analyze artistic expression. PME emphasizes cross-disciplinary synthesis, analytical reasoning, and continuous learning, while Blake's work embodies themes of duality, imagination, and societal critique.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only enriches the understanding of Blake's contributions but also introduces a predictive lens that can inform contemporary discussions on art and society. The novelty lies in applying predictive frameworks to literary analysis, creating a new paradigm for interpreting artistic works.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can PME frameworks enhance the understanding of duality in Blake's work?
2. What predictive insights can be drawn from Blake's exploration of imagination and reason?
3. How does Blake's critique of societal constraints inform modern artistic expression?
