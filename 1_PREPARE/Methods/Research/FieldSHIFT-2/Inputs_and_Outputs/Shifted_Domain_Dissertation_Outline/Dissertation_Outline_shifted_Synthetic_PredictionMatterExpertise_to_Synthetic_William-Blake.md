# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and the life and work of William Blake. By integrating concepts from PME with the rich tapestry of Blake's poetry, visual art, and philosophical insights, this research aims to uncover new interpretations and predictive frameworks that resonate with contemporary societal challenges. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both Blake studies and PME, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and enhancing our understanding of creativity, imagination, and societal dynamics.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the analytical rigor of PME with the artistic and philosophical dimensions of William Blake’s oeuvre. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge across disciplines to inform predictions, while Blake's work embodies a profound exploration of imagination, duality, and human experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it challenges traditional boundaries between literary analysis and predictive methodologies. By applying PME principles to Blake's work, the dissertation will reveal the predictive elements inherent in his philosophy and artistry, thus contributing to both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can PME principles be applied to reinterpret William Blake's works?
- What predictive frameworks can be developed from Blake’s philosophy of contraries?
- In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach inform contemporary societal issues?
