# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative merger of probabilistic programming, as exemplified by RxInfer.jl, with non-science ways of knowing. By examining the intersections between these two domains, the research aims to create a comprehensive framework that enhances our understanding of cultural narratives, intuitive decision-making, and community dynamics. The significance lies in its potential to bridge empirical research and cultural wisdom, ultimately leading to transformative practices in education, policy, and societal well-being.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking convergence of probabilistic programming and non-scientific knowledge systems. RxInfer.jl, a state-of-the-art tool for probabilistic inference, provides a robust methodology for understanding uncertainty and complex systems. Conversely, non-scientific ways of knowing emphasize holistic, narrative, and experiential approaches to understanding human behavior and societal dynamics.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in current scholarship by integrating empirical methodologies with cultural knowledge. It recognizes the value of non-scientific perspectives in enriching academic inquiry and provides a framework for addressing complex global challenges through a more nuanced understanding of human behavior.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can probabilistic models be adapted to represent cultural narratives and non-scientific ways of knowing?
2. What is the role of intuitive decision-making in community dynamics, and how can it be modeled using active inference?
3. How can the integration of these domains lead to novel educational and policy frameworks?
