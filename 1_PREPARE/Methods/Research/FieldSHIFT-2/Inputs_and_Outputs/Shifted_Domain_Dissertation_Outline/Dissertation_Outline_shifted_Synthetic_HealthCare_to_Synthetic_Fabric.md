# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Healthcare Principles to the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of transposing core principles from healthcare to the fabric industry and arts, creating a novel Shifted Domain that enhances consumer engagement, sustainability, and innovation. By integrating patient-centered care, quality service metrics, and technological advancements from healthcare into textile design and production, this research seeks to establish a framework for a more responsive and responsible fabric industry. The findings could significantly impact both fields, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and leading to new practices that prioritize consumer experience and environmental sustainability.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of healthcare principles with the fabric industry represents an innovative paradigm shift. Healthcare has increasingly focused on patient-centered approaches, emphasizing individual experiences and preferences, while the fabric industry grapples with sustainability and ethical production. This dissertation investigates how these principles can be integrated to enhance both fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only addresses the contemporary challenges faced by the fabric industry, such as fast fashion and environmental degradation, but also enriches healthcare practices by exploring consumer engagement in a new context. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, creating a dialogue between two traditionally distinct domains.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to enhance consumer experience in the fabric industry?
2. What are the implications of integrating healthcare technology into textile design?
3. How can sustainable practices in fabric production be informed by holistic healthcare approaches?
4. What new frameworks can be developed to assess fabric quality and consumer satisfaction?
