# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of negotiation and probabilistic programming represents a transformative shift in understanding complex human interactions. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a relational process focused on dialogue and agreement, can benefit from the analytical rigor and computational power of probabilistic models. RxInfer.jl, which employs advanced message passing algorithms for Bayesian inference, provides a robust framework for modeling uncertainties inherent in negotiation scenarios.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering new insights into negotiation dynamics through the application of probabilistic modeling. The novelty lies in treating negotiation as a probabilistic process, where preferences and constraints are represented as random variables, allowing for dynamic updates and more accurate predictions of negotiation outcomes.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can negotiation be effectively modeled as a probabilistic process using RxInfer.jl?
2. What insights can be gained by applying Bayesian inference to traditional negotiation strategies?
3. How do cultural and contextual factors influence the probabilistic modeling of negotiation?

Objectives:
- Develop a theoretical framework that integrates negotiation principles with probabilistic programming.
- Create simulations using RxInfer.jl to analyze negotiation scenarios.
- Propose new methodologies for practitioners based on research findings.

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Negotiation
Negotiation has evolved from simple transactional discussions to a complex interplay of psychology, culture, and strategy. Historical events, such as treaties and business agreements, have shaped negotiation practices, emphasizing the importance of understanding human behavior.

### RxInfer.jl and Probabilistic Programming
The development of probabilistic programming has been propelled by advancements in computational power and statistical methods. RxInfer.jl exemplifies this evolution, offering tools for efficient inference in complex models, particularly in Bayesian contexts.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Negotiation
Current trends emphasize collaborative negotiation, emotional intelligence, and active listening. Research has shown that understanding cultural differences is crucial for successful negotiations.

### RxInfer.jl
RxInfer.jl is recognized for its capabilities in handling large models and non-Gaussian distributions, yet challenges remain in integrating domain knowledge and enhancing model interpretability.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The intersection of negotiation and probabilistic programming reveals gaps in traditional negotiation models, particularly in their inability to account for uncertainties and dynamic preferences. This research aims to address these gaps by leveraging RxInfer.jl to create a more nuanced understanding of negotiation processes.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

### Game Theory
Game theory provides a foundational understanding of strategic interactions, where each party's decision impacts others, paralleling the dynamics in negotiation.

### Bayesian Inference
Bayesian inference offers a robust framework for updating beliefs based on new information, applicable to understanding changing preferences in negotiations.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

### Negotiation as a Probabilistic Process
This construct posits that negotiation scenarios can be modeled as probabilistic frameworks, allowing for the representation of uncertainty and dynamic interactions.

### Active Inference in Negotiation
Active inference principles can be applied to model negotiation dynamics, where agents update beliefs based on observed actions and strive for equilibrium.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model combines negotiation theory and Bayesian inference, proposing that negotiation outcomes can be predicted and analyzed through the lens of probabilistic modeling.
