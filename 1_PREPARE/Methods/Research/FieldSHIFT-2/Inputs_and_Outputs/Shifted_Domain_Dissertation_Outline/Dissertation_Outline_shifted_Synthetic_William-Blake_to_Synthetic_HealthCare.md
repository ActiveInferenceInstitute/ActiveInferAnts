# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between the visionary principles of William Blake and contemporary healthcare practices. By synthesizing Blake's emphasis on imagination, duality, spirituality, and social justice, the research aims to develop an innovative framework for patient-centered care that enhances health outcomes and addresses systemic inequities in healthcare access. This work not only contributes to the academic fields of literature and health studies but also has significant implications for policy, practice, and education within the healthcare system.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
William Blake, a seminal figure in the Romantic movement, is celebrated for his rich, symbolic art and poetry that delve into the complexities of human experience. His works challenge conventional thought and advocate for a more profound understanding of the human spirit. Conversely, the healthcare sector is increasingly recognizing the importance of holistic, patient-centered approaches that go beyond mere clinical interventions. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, creating a framework that incorporates Blake's insights into modern healthcare practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes an original synthesis of literary and artistic principles with healthcare methodologies. By applying Blake's concepts of imagination, duality, and social critique to healthcare, this dissertation aims to foster innovative practices that enhance patient engagement and address health disparities. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that reimagines healthcare through a lens traditionally reserved for the arts and humanities.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's principles of imagination, duality, and spirituality inform contemporary healthcare practices?
2. What are the potential impacts of integrating these principles on patient experiences and health outcomes?
3. How can this interdisciplinary framework address systemic inequities in healthcare access?
