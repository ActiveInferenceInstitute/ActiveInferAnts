# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of William Blake's artistic and philosophical principles into the healthcare sector, creating a Shifted Domain that merges the realms of art and healing. By examining Blake's concepts of imagination, contraries, and spirituality, this research aims to develop new frameworks for patient-centered care that enhance emotional well-being and treatment outcomes. The potential impact of this work extends beyond healthcare, influencing educational paradigms and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. The findings will contribute to a more compassionate, holistic approach to health care, ultimately transforming patient experiences and provider practices.
