# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between the principles of guest experience in hospitality and the ecological and behavioral studies of Hymenoptera. Traditionally viewed as distinct fields, the integration of these disciplines offers new avenues for research that can lead to enhanced understanding of both human and insect social behaviors.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it challenges traditional boundaries between hospitality and ecological studies, promoting a cross-disciplinary approach that can yield fresh perspectives on collective intelligence and communication. The novelty lies in applying hospitality principles—such as personalization, service quality, and sustainability—to the study of social insects, potentially leading to groundbreaking discoveries that could benefit both fields.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience enhance our understanding of collective intelligence in Hymenoptera?
2. What parallels exist between service quality in hospitality and social structure in insect colonies?
3. In what ways can technology integration in hospitality inform communication strategies among Hymenoptera?
4. What are the implications of these integrations for conservation strategies and ecological research?
