# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience in Hospitality to Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience in hospitality and the complex social structures of Hymenoptera. By examining the parallels and potential applications of principles from hospitality—such as personalization, service quality, and technology integration—this research seeks to enhance our understanding of ant behavior and colony dynamics. The findings could revolutionize both fields, offering new insights into collective intelligence and optimizing resource allocation in social insects, while also informing practices in the hospitality industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on delivering personalized and high-quality guest experiences. Conversely, Hymenoptera, including ants and bees, exhibit remarkable social behaviors that demonstrate collective intelligence and intricate communication systems. This dissertation proposes a novel framework that merges these two domains, allowing for a deeper understanding of social structures in insects through the lens of hospitality principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to bridge gaps between entomology and hospitality management, creating a new interdisciplinary field. The novelty lies in applying human-centric hospitality concepts to the natural behaviors of Hymenoptera, offering fresh perspectives on both guest experience and ecological interactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience in hospitality inform our understanding of collective behaviors in Hymenoptera?
2. What are the implications of transposing hospitality concepts onto the social structures and behaviors of ants?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach lead to practical applications in both fields?
