3. How can the integration of these principles enhance player experience and satisfaction?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of Chemistry from alchemy to a systematic science has shaped our understanding of matter and interactions. Meanwhile, Game Design has transitioned from simple mechanics to complex systems that engage players on multiple levels.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current trends in Chemistry emphasize sustainability and computational methods, while Game Design focuses on player engagement, narrative depth, and ethical monetization. However, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that bridges these domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The absence of a framework that integrates scientific principles into game design presents a unique opportunity for innovation. This dissertation aims to fill this gap, providing a structured approach to applying Chemistry concepts in Game Design.
