# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Traditional Knowledge and William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and the life and work of William Blake, proposing a novel framework that integrates indigenous wisdom with artistic expression. By examining the shared principles of interconnectedness, spirituality, and community, this research will illuminate the transformative potential of this Shifted Domain. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to environmental sustainability, cultural preservation, and the evolution of artistic practices, ultimately fostering a holistic understanding of human existence.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, offering insights into sustainable living and ecological balance. William Blake, a seminal figure in Romantic literature and art, critiques rationalism and industrialization while celebrating imagination and spiritual interconnectedness. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, revealing their complementary insights.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms by integrating TK with Blake's artistic vision. It offers a fresh perspective on how art can promote ecological consciousness and cultural sustainability. The novelty lies in the proposed framework of "Ecological Aesthetics," which emphasizes the role of art in fostering a deeper connection to nature and community.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the principles of Traditional Knowledge inform and enrich our understanding of William Blake's work?
- What new paradigms emerge from the integration of TK and Blake's artistic expressions?
- How can this Shifted Domain contribute to contemporary discourses on sustainability, culture, and art?
