# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between traditional knowledge systems and the artistic legacy of William Blake. By examining how Blake's work reflects and can inform contemporary ecological practices and spiritual understanding, this research aims to create an integrated framework that honors the wisdom of traditional knowledge while revitalizing Blake’s contributions to art and culture. The potential impact of this work lies in its capacity to inspire new artistic expressions, promote ecological stewardship, and foster a deeper connection to cultural identities, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and interconnected future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of traditional knowledge and the life and work of William Blake represents an innovative domain shift that emphasizes the interconnectedness of art, ecology, and spirituality. Traditional knowledge systems, often rooted in indigenous practices, offer holistic approaches to understanding the world, while Blake's visionary art critiques the materialism of his time and advocates for a deeper connection to nature and the divine.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, providing a fresh perspective on both traditional knowledge and Blake’s artistic contributions. It underscores the relevance of Blake's work in contemporary discussions about sustainability and cultural identity, while also highlighting the transformative potential of traditional knowledge in informing modern artistic practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How does William Blake’s work reflect the principles of traditional ecological knowledge?
2. In what ways can Blake's artistic practices be interpreted as modern rituals that facilitate spiritual and communal engagement?
3. What new theoretical frameworks can emerge from the integration of these two domains?
