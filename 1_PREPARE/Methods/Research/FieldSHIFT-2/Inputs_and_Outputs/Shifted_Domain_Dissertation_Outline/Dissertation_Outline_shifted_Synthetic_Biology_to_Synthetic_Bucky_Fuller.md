# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystems into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Design Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating biological ecosystem principles with Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy. By examining the interconnectedness, diversity, energy flow, resilience, and keystone species of ecosystems, alongside Fuller's holistic design, tensegrity, and ephemeralization, this research will develop a new theoretical framework and practical methodologies for sustainable architecture. The anticipated impact includes advancing interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering innovative design practices, and contributing to ecological sustainability in architecture and urban planning.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of biological ecosystems and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy represents a groundbreaking approach to addressing contemporary environmental challenges. Ecosystems provide a model of resilience and adaptability, while Fuller’s principles advocate for sustainable and efficient design solutions. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform each other to create a new paradigm in design thinking.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it combines two previously distinct fields, offering novel insights into sustainable architecture and design. By integrating ecological principles into design methodologies, we can create structures that are not only functional but also environmentally harmonious. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to reshape architectural practices and contribute to sustainability on a global scale.
