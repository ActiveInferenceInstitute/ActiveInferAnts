# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection between non-science ways of knowing—such as indigenous knowledge, artistic expression, and experiential learning—and blockchain technology, a decentralized and immutable ledger system. This integration offers an innovative approach to understanding and applying blockchain in ways that resonate with diverse cultural perspectives and holistic methodologies.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of knowledge and technology. By incorporating non-science perspectives, the study aims to redefine how blockchain technology can be understood and utilized, making it more inclusive and applicable to a broader range of societal contexts. This novel approach not only enhances the technology itself but also promotes a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness between human experiences and the natural world.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing be effectively integrated into blockchain technology?
2. What are the implications of this integration for governance, education, and community engagement?
3. How can the principles of sustainability and cultural preservation be enhanced through blockchain applications that incorporate diverse knowledge systems?
