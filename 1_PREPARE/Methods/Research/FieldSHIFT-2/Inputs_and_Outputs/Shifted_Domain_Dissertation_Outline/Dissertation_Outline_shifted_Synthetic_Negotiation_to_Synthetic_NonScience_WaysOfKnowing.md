# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles (Domain A) with non-science ways of knowing (Domain B). By examining the intersections between these two distinct fields, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances understanding, interpersonal relationships, and conflict resolution. The significance of this work lies in its potential to foster cross-cultural dialogue, promote holistic decision-making, and create new educational paradigms. This dissertation will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications, ultimately influencing policy-making and societal resilience.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of negotiation strategies and non-scientific epistemologies. Negotiation has traditionally been rooted in structured methodologies aimed at achieving mutually beneficial outcomes, while non-science ways of knowing encompass intuitive, cultural, and experiential understandings. This research seeks to bridge these domains, offering a more comprehensive perspective on knowledge acquisition and conflict resolution.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of negotiation principles with non-science ways of knowing presents a novel approach to understanding complex issues. This research is significant as it challenges the dominance of empirical methods in knowledge creation, advocating for a more inclusive framework that values diverse perspectives. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of negotiation elements into non-scientific contexts, fostering innovative methodologies and applications.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated with non-science ways of knowing to enhance understanding and conflict resolution?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration, and how can they be operationalized in practical contexts?
3. In what ways can this Shifted Domain contribute to interdisciplinary collaboration and societal resilience?

# Literature Review

- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Explore the historical roots of non-scientific epistemologies, emphasizing indigenous knowledge systems, spiritual practices, and cultural narratives.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

- **Negotiation**: Review contemporary trends, including cross-cultural negotiation practices, technological advancements, and ethical considerations.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Examine current paradigms emphasizing subjective experience and cultural narratives, along with challenges faced in academic and professional contexts.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Identify gaps in existing research that the Shifted Domain addresses, including the need for holistic frameworks that integrate diverse epistemologies and the potential for innovative educational approaches.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Negotiation Theories**: Discuss key theories such as the Dual Concern Model, Integrative Bargaining, and the Fisher-Ury Principled Negotiation.
- **Non-Scientific Epistemologies**: Explore theories surrounding indigenous knowledge, emotional intelligence, and narrative inquiry.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

Introduce emerging constructs such as Relational Knowledge Theory, Cultural Negotiation Theory, and the Holistic Decision-Making Model.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

Present a comprehensive model that synthesizes negotiation principles with non-science ways of knowing, highlighting the interplay of relationships, culture, and emotion in knowledge creation.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

Outline a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of negotiation and non-science ways of knowing.

## Data Collection Methods

- **Interviews**: Conduct interviews with negotiators and practitioners of non-scientific knowledge.
- **Surveys**: Administer surveys to assess perceptions of cultural narratives in negotiation contexts.
- **Case Studies**: Analyze real-world examples of successful integrations.

## Analytical Approaches

Utilize thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical methods for quantitative data to identify patterns and insights.

## Ethical Considerations

Address ethical concerns related to cultural sensitivity, informed consent, and the respectful integration of non-scientific perspectives.
