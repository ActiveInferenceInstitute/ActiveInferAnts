# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) into the Guest Experience (GE) within the hospitality industry. By systematically transposing the principles of TK into GE, this research will uncover innovative frameworks that enhance guest satisfaction, promote sustainability, and preserve cultural heritage. The significance of this study lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging indigenous wisdom with contemporary hospitality practices, thereby creating a new paradigm that resonates with modern travelers' expectations. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and community engagement.

## Introduction
