# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Traditional Knowledge in the Context of Guest Experience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Guest Experience (GE) within the hospitality industry. By integrating the sustainable practices and cultural richness of TK into the guest experience framework, this research aims to redefine hospitality practices, enhance guest satisfaction, and promote community engagement. The potential impact of this research extends beyond the hospitality sector, influencing environmental conservation, tourism, and cultural studies. This dissertation will provide a roadmap for implementing TK principles in hospitality, addressing current challenges, and creating a more responsible and enriching industry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Traditional Knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, emphasizing sustainability and cultural identity. Guest Experience focuses on the holistic journey of a guest in hospitality settings. This dissertation aims to fuse these two domains, creating a new paradigm for hospitality that values cultural immersion and sustainable practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the growing demand for sustainable and culturally authentic experiences in hospitality. The novelty lies in the systematic application of TK principles to enhance guest experiences, creating a framework that can lead to transformative changes in the industry.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of Traditional Knowledge enhance the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What are the measurable impacts of integrating TK on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. In what ways can hospitality practices be redefined to incorporate community engagement and sustainability?

## Literature Review
