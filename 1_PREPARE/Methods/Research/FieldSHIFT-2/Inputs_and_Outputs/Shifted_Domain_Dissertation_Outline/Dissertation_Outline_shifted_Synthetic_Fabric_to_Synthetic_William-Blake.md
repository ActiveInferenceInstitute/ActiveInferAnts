# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and the artistic and literary contributions of William Blake. By analyzing the shared principles, narratives, and methodologies of these two domains, the research seeks to uncover new interpretations of Blake’s work through the lens of textile arts. This exploration is significant not only for enhancing our understanding of Blake's themes but also for promoting sustainability and interdisciplinary collaboration in contemporary artistic practices. The potential impact of this research extends to redefining educational approaches, informing cultural discourse, and fostering innovative artistic expressions that resonate with today’s societal challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has a rich history characterized by creativity, craftsmanship, and technological advancement. Similarly, William Blake’s work transcends the boundaries of literature and visual art, offering profound insights into the human experience. This dissertation investigates how the tactile and sensory nature of textiles can illuminate Blake's themes, fostering a deeper understanding of both domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it challenges traditional boundaries between disciplines, proposing a framework that integrates textile arts with literary studies. By doing so, it aims to reveal new narratives within Blake’s work and address contemporary issues such as sustainability and cultural identity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the fabric industry enhance the interpretation of William Blake’s work?
2. What new narratives emerge from the integration of textile arts and Blake’s themes?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform educational practices and cultural discourse?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The fabric industry has evolved from artisanal practices to industrial production, reflecting societal changes and technological advancements. Blake’s work, rooted in the Romantic era, critiques materialism and rationalism, offering a counter-narrative to the industrial age.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in the fabric industry emphasizes sustainability and ethical practices, while studies of Blake focus on his literary and visual innovations. However, there is a lack of interdisciplinary scholarship that connects these domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The gap lies in the absence of studies that explore the intersection of textile arts and Blake’s work. This presents an opportunity to develop new methodologies that can enrich both fields.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Cultural Theory**: Explains how textiles serve as cultural artifacts.
- **Literary Theory**: Analyzes the narrative structures in Blake’s poetry and art.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Interdisciplinary Aesthetics**: A framework that integrates visual and tactile experiences in understanding art.
- **Sustainable Creativity**: A concept that merges artistic expression with eco-friendly practices.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that positions textile arts as a narrative medium for interpreting Blake’s themes, emphasizing the interconnectedness of creativity, sustainability, and cultural expression.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersections of textile arts and Blake’s work.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Interviews**: Conduct interviews with textile artists and literary scholars.
- **Workshops**: Organize workshops to create textile interpretations of Blake’s themes.
- **Exhibitions**: Analyze audience responses to exhibitions that blend both domains.

### Analytical Approaches
