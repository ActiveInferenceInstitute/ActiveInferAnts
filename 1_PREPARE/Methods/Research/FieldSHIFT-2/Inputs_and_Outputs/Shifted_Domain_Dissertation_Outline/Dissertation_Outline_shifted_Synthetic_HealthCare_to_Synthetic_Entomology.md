# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Health Care Principles Applied to Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of applying health care principles to the field of entomology. By drawing parallels between patient-centered care in health systems and insect-centered approaches in ecological conservation, this research seeks to develop innovative frameworks for understanding and enhancing the roles of insects in ecosystems. The anticipated outcomes include improved public engagement, sustainable conservation strategies, and interdisciplinary collaborations that can lead to significant advancements in both health care and environmental science.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of health care and entomology represents a groundbreaking shift, where principles traditionally associated with human health are applied to the ecological roles of insects. This emerging domain seeks to address pressing environmental issues, such as declining insect populations and their impact on biodiversity and agriculture.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it integrates health care methodologies into entomology, creating a holistic framework that emphasizes the interconnectedness of human and ecological health. The novelty lies in the application of patient-centered care principles to foster a more inclusive and engaged approach to insect conservation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can health care principles be effectively transposed to enhance insect conservation efforts?
- What new frameworks can be developed to assess ecosystem health through the lens of insect populations?
- In what ways can public engagement strategies in health care inform conservation practices in entomology?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
This section will explore the evolution of health care from ancient practices to modern patient-centered approaches, alongside the historical development of entomology, focusing on its ecological importance and challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
An overview of current trends in health care, such as telemedicine and personalized medicine, will be juxtaposed with contemporary challenges in entomology, including biodiversity loss and the need for sustainable practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying gaps in existing research, this section will highlight the lack of interdisciplinary approaches in both fields and the potential for innovative solutions through their integration.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
Key theories from health care, such as the Health Belief Model and Patient Activation Theory, will be discussed, alongside foundational ecological theories relevant to entomology.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
This section will propose new constructs that emerge from the integration of both fields, such as the Insect-Centered Care Model and Ecosystem Service Quality Theory.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model will be presented, illustrating the relationships between health care principles and ecological outcomes in the context of entomology.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative assessments of insect populations with qualitative research on public perceptions and engagement.

### Data Collection Methods
Data will be gathered through surveys, community engagement programs, and ecological monitoring techniques.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analyses will be used to assess relationships between public engagement and insect population health, while thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative data.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations will include informed consent for community participation, ensuring that conservation efforts are equitable and do not harm existing ecosystems.
