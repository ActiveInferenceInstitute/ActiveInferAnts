# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Health Care Principles into Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of health care and entomology, proposing a groundbreaking framework that applies patient-centered care principles to insect conservation and management. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance ecosystem services provided by insects while addressing the alarming decline in insect populations. By integrating methodologies from health care into entomology, this research will create a novel perspective that fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, promotes sustainable practices, and informs policy decisions. The anticipated impact includes improved conservation strategies, enhanced agricultural productivity, and a deeper understanding of the ecological roles of insects.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of health care and entomology, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Health care focuses on the well-being of human patients, prioritizing personalized care, service quality, and technology integration. In contrast, entomology studies insects, emphasizing their ecological roles, behavior, and conservation needs. This dissertation proposes to bridge these domains by applying health care principles to entomological research and practice.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to applying health care frameworks to entomology, creating an interdisciplinary paradigm that prioritizes insect health and ecosystem services. By treating insect populations as "patients," the dissertation aims to develop metrics and methodologies that enhance our understanding of insect behavior and ecological contributions. This shift has the potential to revolutionize conservation strategies and agricultural practices, making them more sustainable and effective.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can patient-centered care principles enhance the conservation and management of insect populations?
2. What metrics can be developed to assess the quality of ecosystem services provided by insects?
3. How can technology be utilized to improve our understanding of insect communication and behavior?
4. What interdisciplinary collaborations can be fostered to advance research in this Shifted Domain?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The historical evolution of health care has seen a shift from provider-centered to patient-centered approaches, emphasizing the importance of individual experiences and outcomes. In entomology, the focus has shifted towards understanding biodiversity and the ecological roles of insects, particularly in light of declining populations.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current health care research emphasizes personalized medicine, data-driven decision-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration. In entomology, key research areas include biodiversity conservation, pest management, and the study of insect behavior and physiology. However, there is limited exploration of how principles from health care can inform entomological practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that connect health care with entomology presents an opportunity to innovate research methodologies and conservation strategies. This dissertation will address these gaps by developing a comprehensive model that integrates health care principles into entomology.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Health Care:** Patient-centered care, service quality models, and technology integration theories.
- **Entomology:** Biodiversity theories, ecological balance, and social behavior theories in insect populations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Insect-Centered Conservation Theory:** A framework that prioritizes the needs and health of insect populations.
- **Ecosystem Service Quality Model:** A model for assessing the quality of services provided by insects in ecological contexts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model combining health care principles with entomological practices, emphasizing the interdependence of human and insect health within ecosystems.

## Methodology
