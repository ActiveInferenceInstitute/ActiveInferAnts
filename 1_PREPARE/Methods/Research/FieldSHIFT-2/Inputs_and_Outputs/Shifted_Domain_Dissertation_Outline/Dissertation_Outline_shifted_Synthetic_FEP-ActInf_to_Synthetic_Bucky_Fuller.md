# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with Buckminster Fuller’s visionary concepts in architecture and sustainability. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research seeks to develop predictive architectural models and adaptive design strategies that enhance resilience and sustainability in built environments. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize architectural practices, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and address pressing global challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize surprise to maintain their stability, while Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy emphasizes holistic design and sustainability. This dissertation seeks to merge these two paradigms, creating a novel framework for understanding and designing resilient systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, providing a fresh perspective on architectural design through the lens of systems theory and cognitive science. The novelty lies in the application of FEP to Fuller’s principles, potentially leading to innovative solutions for sustainable living.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be applied to enhance architectural design?
2. In what ways can Fuller's concepts inform the development of adaptive, predictive models in architecture?
