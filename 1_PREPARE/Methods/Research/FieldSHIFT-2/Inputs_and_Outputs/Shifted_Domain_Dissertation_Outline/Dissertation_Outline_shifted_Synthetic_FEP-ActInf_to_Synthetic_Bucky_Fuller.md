# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference within the paradigms established by Buckminster Fuller. By analyzing the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research will develop a new theoretical framework for adaptive design systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to redefine design methodologies, promote sustainability, and enhance resource management. The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications in architecture, engineering, environmental science, and cognitive science, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.
