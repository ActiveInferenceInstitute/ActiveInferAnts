# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing—such as cultural narratives, intuition, and holistic understanding—into the design and functionality of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). By bridging the gap between subjective human experiences and transactional technology, this research seeks to enhance user experience, accessibility, and emotional engagement in financial transactions. The implications of this study extend beyond ATM design to inform broader fields, including financial technology, user experience design, and cultural studies.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between non-science ways of knowing and the technical world of ATM transactions. Non-science knowledge systems offer insights into human behavior and societal dynamics that are often overlooked in traditional technological design. ATMs, while primarily focused on efficiency and security, can benefit from a more holistic approach that incorporates these diverse perspectives.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of ATM design by proposing a user-centered approach that values emotional intelligence and cultural context. The novelty lies in the application of non-science methodologies to a traditionally empirical field, creating a framework for enhancing user experience through narrative-driven and culturally adaptive interfaces.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing be integrated into ATM design to improve user experience?
- What is the impact of narrative-driven interfaces on user satisfaction and engagement?
- How does cultural adaptability in ATM design influence usability among diverse populations?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing:** Exploration of indigenous knowledge systems, philosophy, and art as valid forms of understanding.
- **ATM Transactions:** Historical evolution from basic cash dispensers to multifunctional devices, highlighting technological advancements and user behavior changes.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Non-Science Knowledge:** Growing recognition of its value in various domains, including healthcare and environmental science.
- **ATM Design:** Focus on efficiency, security, and accessibility, with limited attention to emotional and cultural dimensions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration of emotional and cultural factors in ATM design.
- Opportunity to enhance user experience by applying non-scientific methodologies to technology.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Constructivist Learning Theory:** Emphasizes the role of personal experiences in knowledge creation.
- **Cultural Studies Theory:** Explores how cultural narratives shape understanding and behavior.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Narrative Engagement Theory:** Proposes that storytelling can enhance user interaction and satisfaction.
- **Cultural Resonance Theory:** Suggests that culturally adaptive designs increase user engagement and usability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines narrative engagement and cultural resonance theories to inform ATM interface design.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore user experiences with traditional and narrative-driven ATM interfaces.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews to gather qualitative insights on user experiences.
- A/B testing to quantitatively measure user satisfaction and transaction efficiency.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for quantitative data, including regression models to assess the impact of narrative and cultural factors.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent, data privacy, and the ethical use of user feedback in design processes.
