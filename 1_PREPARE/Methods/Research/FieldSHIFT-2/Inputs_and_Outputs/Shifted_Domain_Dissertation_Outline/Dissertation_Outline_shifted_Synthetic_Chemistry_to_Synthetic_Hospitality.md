# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Chemical Reaction Principles into Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemical reaction principles and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By transposing core concepts from chemistry—such as transformation, catalysis, equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanisms—into the context of hospitality, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize hospitality management practices, foster personalized guest experiences, and create sustainable service models. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also offer practical applications for the hospitality industry, promising substantial impacts on service quality, guest loyalty, and overall business success.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of guest experience as a key driver of success. Concurrently, the principles of chemical reactions have long been established as foundational concepts in scientific inquiry. This dissertation proposes a novel approach by integrating these two domains, thereby creating a new paradigm for understanding and enhancing guest experiences through the lens of chemical reaction principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, bridging the gap between the sciences and hospitality management. It introduces a transformative framework that can reshape service delivery, improve guest satisfaction, and foster loyalty. The novelty lies in the application of chemical principles to a traditionally qualitative field, allowing for a more structured and analytical approach to guest experience design.
