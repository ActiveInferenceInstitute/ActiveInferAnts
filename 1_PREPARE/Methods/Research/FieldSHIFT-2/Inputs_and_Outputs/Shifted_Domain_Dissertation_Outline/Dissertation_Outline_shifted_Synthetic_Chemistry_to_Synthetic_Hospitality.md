By framing guest experiences in terms of chemical reactions and processes, this dissertation provides a fresh perspective that can lead to enhanced service models and improved guest satisfaction. The novelty lies in the application of established chemical theories to the dynamic and often subjective realm of guest interactions.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of Chemistry be applied to understand and improve the Guest Experience in hospitality?
2. What are the parallels between chemical reactions and guest interactions, and how can these insights inform service delivery?
3. What novel frameworks can be developed to integrate these two domains effectively?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Chemistry
Chemistry has evolved from ancient alchemical practices to a robust scientific discipline focused on the properties, composition, and transformations of matter. Key historical milestones include the development of the periodic table, advancements in organic chemistry, and the emergence of green chemistry.

### Guest Experience
The concept of guest experience has transitioned from a focus on basic service delivery to a comprehensive understanding of customer interactions, driven by technology and personalization. Historical developments include the rise of customer service management and the integration of technology in hospitality.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Chemistry
Current trends in Chemistry emphasize sustainability, computational modeling, and the development of new materials. Research focuses on understanding molecular interactions and reaction mechanisms.

### Guest Experience
The hospitality industry is increasingly adopting technology to enhance guest experiences, with a focus on personalization, consistency, and real-time feedback mechanisms. However, many challenges remain, including balancing technology with human interaction.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

While both fields have made significant strides, there is a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects the systematic methodologies of Chemistry with the experiential nature of hospitality. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovation by applying chemical concepts to enhance guest interactions.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Chemical Reactions**: Understanding how substances interact and transform.
2. **Catalysis**: The role of catalysts in accelerating reactions without being consumed.
