This Shifted Domain invites an exploration of celestial phenomena alongside Blake’s mythological constructs, revealing parallels that enrich our understanding of both disciplines.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between empirical science and artistic expression, challenging the traditional boundaries that separate these fields. By integrating astronomical concepts into the interpretation of Blake's work, the dissertation will uncover new insights into both the nature of the universe and the human imagination.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can astronomical principles be applied to interpret the themes and characters in Blake's work?
2. What is the relationship between cosmic dynamics and the dualities present in Blake's poetry?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach foster new educational and creative practices?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Astronomy**: From ancient civilizations to modern astrophysics, the evolution of astronomical thought has been marked by key developments such as the heliocentric model and the discovery of exoplanets.
- **William Blake**: As a pivotal figure in the Romantic movement, Blake's work reflects a deep engagement with spirituality, imagination, and the critique of rationalism.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Astronomy**: Current trends focus on exoplanet research, dark matter, and the philosophical implications of cosmic discoveries.
- **Blake Studies**: Recent scholarship emphasizes the interplay of imagination, spirituality, and social critique in Blake's work, yet often overlooks the potential connections to scientific inquiry.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
This dissertation seeks to fill the gap in interdisciplinary research that connects astronomical concepts with artistic expression, offering new avenues for exploration and understanding.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Astronomy**: Theories of cosmic evolution, gravitational dynamics, and the nature of light and energy.
- **Blake's Work**: Theories of imagination, duality, and the critique of reason.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Cosmic Imagination**: A concept that intertwines the creative processes of both artists and astronomers, suggesting that imagination is a fundamental force in understanding the universe.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that posits a parallel between cosmic phenomena and Blake’s mythological narratives, illustrating how both realms reflect the human experience and the quest for understanding.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
This research will adopt a qualitative, interdisciplinary approach, utilizing textual analysis, comparative studies, and thematic exploration.

### Data Collection Methods
- Analysis of Blake’s poetry and visual art.
- Review of contemporary astronomical literature and discoveries.
- Interviews with experts in both fields.

### Analytical Approaches
- Comparative analysis to identify parallels between astronomical concepts and Blake’s themes.
- Thematic coding to extract insights from Blake’s work related to cosmic dynamics.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure respectful representation of Blake’s work and the scientific community, maintaining integrity in interdisciplinary dialogue.
