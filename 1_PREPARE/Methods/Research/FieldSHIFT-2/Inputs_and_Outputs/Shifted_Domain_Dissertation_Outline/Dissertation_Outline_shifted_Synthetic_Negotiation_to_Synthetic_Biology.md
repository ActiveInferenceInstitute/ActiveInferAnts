# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Biology/Ecosystems

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and ecological dynamics, termed "Ecosystem Negotiation Theory." By systematically transposing concepts from negotiation into the study of ecosystems, this research aims to uncover new insights into species interactions, resource allocation, and community dynamics. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize ecological theory, inform conservation strategies, and enhance interdisciplinary education. The findings may lead to practical applications in ecosystem management, policy-making, and addressing environmental challenges, ultimately fostering sustainable practices that benefit both human and ecological communities.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a pioneering fusion between negotiation—an established social science—and biology/ecosystems, a field characterized by complex interactions among organisms and their environments. Understanding ecosystems through the lens of negotiation opens new pathways for exploration, emphasizing the dynamic relationships that mirror human negotiation processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering a novel perspective on how species negotiate for survival and resources within ecosystems. The application of negotiation theories to biological contexts is a groundbreaking approach that can enhance our understanding of biodiversity, resilience, and ecosystem health.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be applied to understand species interactions and resource allocation in ecosystems?
2. What are the implications of viewing ecosystems as negotiation arenas for conservation and management practices?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach inform educational curricula and practical applications in ecology?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation:** Review the evolution of negotiation theories, methodologies, and key concepts such as BATNA and cultural influences.
- **Biology/Ecosystems:** Examine the foundational theories in ecology, including biodiversity, energy flow, and resilience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analyze contemporary research in negotiation strategies and ecological interactions, highlighting advancements and ongoing debates.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identify gaps in current ecological theories that could benefit from negotiation frameworks, emphasizing the potential for interdisciplinary research.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Outline key negotiation theories, such as interest-based negotiation and game theory, and their relevance to ecological interactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Introduce the concept of Ecosystem Negotiation Theory, which reinterprets species interactions as negotiations for resources.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Develop a model that illustrates the relationships between negotiation principles and ecological dynamics, including feedback loops and adaptive strategies.

## Methodology

- Employ a mixed-methods approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative research to explore the application of negotiation principles in ecosystems.

### Data Collection Methods
- Utilize field studies, experiments, and simulations to gather data on species interactions and resource allocation strategies.

### Analytical Approaches
- Apply statistical modeling and qualitative analysis to interpret data, focusing on patterns of negotiation in ecological contexts.

### Ethical Considerations
- Address ethical concerns related to ecological research, including the impact on species and habitats, and ensure adherence to conservation principles.
