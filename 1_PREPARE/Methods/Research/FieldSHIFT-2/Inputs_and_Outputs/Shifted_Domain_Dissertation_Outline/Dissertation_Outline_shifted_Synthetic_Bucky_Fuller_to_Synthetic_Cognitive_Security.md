# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative intersection between Buckminster Fuller’s holistic design principles and the emerging field of cognitive security. By systematically transposing Fuller's concepts onto cognitive security, the research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that addresses the complexities of misinformation and cognitive manipulation in the digital age. The significance of this research lies in its potential to foster a more resilient society, equipped to navigate the challenges posed by the rapid spread of misinformation. The proposed contributions include new theoretical models, practical applications, and interdisciplinary collaborations that can enhance cognitive security practices across various sectors.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of Buckminster Fuller’s pioneering design philosophy and the contemporary challenges of cognitive security. Fuller’s principles, rooted in systems thinking and sustainable practices, offer valuable insights into the management of information ecosystems. Cognitive security, on the other hand, focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation and deception, emphasizing the need for resilience in the face of misinformation.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges two distinct fields, providing a novel perspective on cognitive security through Fuller's holistic lens. By understanding cognitive security as a cognitive ecosystem, the study aims to develop strategies that enhance public resilience against misinformation. The novelty lies in the application of Fuller's design principles to contemporary issues of cognitive manipulation, creating a framework that is both innovative and practical.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s design principles inform and enhance cognitive security practices?
2. What new theoretical models can emerge from the intersection of these two domains?
3. How can interdisciplinary collaborations be fostered to address cognitive security challenges effectively?
