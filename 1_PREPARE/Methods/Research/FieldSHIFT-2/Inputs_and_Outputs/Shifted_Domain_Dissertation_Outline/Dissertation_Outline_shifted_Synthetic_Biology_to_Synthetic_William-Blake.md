# PhD Dissertation Plan: "Ecosystem Dynamics in the Life and Work of William Blake: An Interdisciplinary Approach"

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating ecological principles with the literary and artistic oeuvre of William Blake. By framing Blake's work within the context of ecosystem dynamics, this research seeks to uncover new insights into the interconnectedness of his themes, the resilience of his characters, and the biodiversity of ideas present in his poetry and art. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the understanding of Blake's contributions to literature but also highlights the relevance of ecological dynamics in the humanities. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both literary studies and ecological discourse, paving the way for new sub-disciplines and innovative pedagogical approaches.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of ecology and literature, particularly the works of William Blake, represents a novel interdisciplinary domain. This shift allows for a fresh perspective on Blake's exploration of human experience, spirituality, and societal critique, framed through ecological principles such as interconnectedness, resilience, and biodiversity.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional literary analysis by introducing ecological frameworks, offering a new lens through which to interpret Blake's work. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of ecosystem dynamics into literary analysis, fostering a deeper understanding of Blake's thematic complexity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecological principles illuminate the interconnected themes in Blake's work?
2. In what ways do Blake's characters exemplify resilience akin to ecological systems?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from viewing Blake’s oeuvre through an ecological lens?

## Literature Review
