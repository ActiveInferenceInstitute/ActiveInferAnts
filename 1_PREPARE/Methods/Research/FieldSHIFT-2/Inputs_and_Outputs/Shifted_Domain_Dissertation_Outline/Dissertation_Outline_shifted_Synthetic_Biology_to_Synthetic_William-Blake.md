# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Biological Ecosystems onto William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection of biological ecosystems and the life and work of William Blake, creating a novel framework for understanding the interconnectedness of art, nature, and society. By analyzing Blake's contributions through the lens of ecological principles, this research aims to illuminate the dynamics of artistic communities as ecosystems, emphasizing themes of interdependence, energy flow, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and resilience. The study will not only expand the discourse surrounding Blake's work but will also offer practical applications for art education, interdisciplinary collaborations, and societal transformation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of biology and ecosystems with the study of William Blake's art and poetry presents a unique opportunity to re-evaluate both fields. Ecosystems are defined by complex interactions among organisms and their environments, while Blake's work reflects deep interconnectedness and social critique. This dissertation will explore how principles from ecology can provide insights into Blake's artistic community and his creative processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally separate domains, offering a fresh perspective on Blake's contributions and the role of art in society. By applying ecological principles to Blake's work, the dissertation aims to uncover new meanings and implications, ultimately contributing to the fields of art history, ecology, and cultural studies. The novelty lies in the development of an "Artistic Ecosystem Theory" that redefines artistic communities as dynamic, interdependent systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can ecological principles be applied to understand the dynamics of artistic communities?
- In what ways do Blake's works reflect the characteristics of biological ecosystems?
- What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for contemporary art practice and education?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Biology and Ecosystems:** Overview of ecological theories, including interdependence, energy flow, and nutrient cycling, with a focus on key figures such as Darwin, Odum, and Leopold.
- **William Blake's Life and Work:** Examination of Blake's biography, artistic philosophy, and major works, highlighting his themes of interconnectedness and social critique.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Biological Ecosystems:** Recent advancements in ecology, including studies on climate change impacts, conservation efforts, and ecosystem services.
- **Blake Studies:** Current interpretations of Blake's work, including feminist, post-colonial, and psychoanalytic approaches.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identification of a lack of interdisciplinary research that integrates ecological principles with literary and artistic analysis, presenting an opportunity for innovative scholarship.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Ecological Theories:** Concepts of resilience, biodiversity, and energy flow.
- **Artistic Theories:** Theories of interconnectedness in art and the role of the artist in society.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
Development of an "Artistic Ecosystem Theory" that posits artistic communities as living systems with unique dynamics, influenced by ecological principles.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A visual model illustrating the interplay between ecological principles and artistic expression, highlighting key components such as collaboration, competition, and innovation.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analyses of Blake's works with quantitative studies of artistic communities.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Textual Analysis:** Close reading of Blake's poetry and visual art.
- **Field Studies:** Observations of contemporary artistic collaborations.
- **Surveys and Interviews:** Gathering insights from artists, critics, and art educators.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis:** Identifying recurring themes in Blake's work and their ecological parallels.
- **Network Analysis:** Mapping relationships within artistic communities to visualize interdependence and influence.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring the ethical treatment of participants in interviews and surveys, as well as proper citation and acknowledgment of Blake's work.
