# Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes an innovative exploration of the Shifted Domain that merges the fabric industry and arts with the philosophical principles of Buckminster Fuller. By integrating sustainability, design science, and tensegrity, this research aims to redefine textile production and design practices, fostering a new paradigm that prioritizes ecological integrity, cultural narratives, and technological advancement. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize the fabric industry, create sustainable practices, and inspire interdisciplinary collaborations that can lead to a more resilient and adaptive future.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fabric industry has traditionally been viewed as a separate entity from the philosophical and design principles espoused by thinkers like Buckminster Fuller. However, as global environmental challenges intensify, the need for sustainable practices and innovative design solutions has become paramount. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by examining how Fuller's concepts can inform and transform the fabric industry.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, combining the rich traditions of textile design with Fuller's holistic and systems-based philosophies. By doing so, it opens up new avenues for sustainable practices, innovative materials, and cultural expression within the fabric industry. The potential impact includes not only advancements in textile production but also a broader cultural shift towards sustainability in design.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s principles of sustainability and design science be applied to the fabric industry?
2. What are the implications of tensegrity principles in textile design and construction?
3. How can eco-design science reshape the production processes and cultural narratives within the textile industry?
