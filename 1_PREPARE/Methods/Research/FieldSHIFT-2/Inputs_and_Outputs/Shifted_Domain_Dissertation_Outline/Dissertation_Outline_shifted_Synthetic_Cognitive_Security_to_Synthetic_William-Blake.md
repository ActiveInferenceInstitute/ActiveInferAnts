# Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of cognitive security and the life and work of William Blake, proposing a transformative framework that positions Blake's artistic expressions as precursors to modern cognitive security principles. By analyzing Blake's dualities, imagination, and social critiques, the research aims to uncover how his works can inform contemporary discussions on misinformation, critical thinking, and media literacy. The potential impact of this research extends beyond literary analysis, offering novel insights into educational practices, technological applications, and interdisciplinary collaborations that enhance cognitive resilience in the digital age.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a unique convergence of cognitive security—a field focused on safeguarding cognitive processes from manipulation—and the rich, complex world of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art. This fusion seeks to understand how Blake's exploration of truth, imagination, and social critique can inform and enhance contemporary cognitive security frameworks.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two seemingly disparate fields, offering fresh perspectives on both cognitive security and Blake's work. By applying cognitive security principles to Blake's poetry, the study reinterprets his contributions as vital resources for understanding and combating modern misinformation and cognitive manipulation.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can William Blake's artistic and poetic innovations be understood as early forms of cognitive security?
2. What role does imagination play in enhancing cognitive resilience against societal manipulation?
3. How can Blake's works be integrated into educational frameworks to promote critical thinking and media literacy?
