# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security Principles into Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of physical security principles into the field of astronomy, creating a novel interdisciplinary domain termed "Astro-Security." The research will investigate how methodologies from physical security can enhance our understanding and management of cosmic threats, such as near-Earth objects (NEOs) and data security in astronomical research. The potential impact of this work is significant, promising advancements in both fields and the establishment of new paradigms for cosmic risk management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the principles of physical security—focused on protecting tangible assets—from the field of astronomy, which studies celestial phenomena. This intersection allows for a reimagining of how we monitor and manage threats from space, leveraging established security methodologies to enhance observational capabilities and data protection.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it addresses the growing concern of cosmic threats while also ensuring the integrity and security of astronomical data. The novelty lies in applying concepts traditionally associated with physical security to a new context, thus creating a framework that could revolutionize how we approach both fields.
