# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between non-science ways of knowing and RSA cryptography. Non-science ways of knowing emphasize subjective experience, cultural knowledge, and holistic approaches, while RSA cryptography relies on mathematical principles for secure communications. This fusion invites a re-examination of how knowledge is constructed, disseminated, and applied in the context of cybersecurity.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The integration of non-science perspectives into cryptographic education and practice is novel, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that often alienate non-technical audiences. By emphasizing intuition and cultural narratives, this research aims to democratize understanding of cryptographic principles, making them accessible to a broader audience and fostering greater community engagement.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the understanding and application of RSA cryptography?
2. What innovative pedagogical approaches can be developed to integrate these perspectives into cryptographic education?
3. What are the potential societal impacts of this integration on cybersecurity practices?
