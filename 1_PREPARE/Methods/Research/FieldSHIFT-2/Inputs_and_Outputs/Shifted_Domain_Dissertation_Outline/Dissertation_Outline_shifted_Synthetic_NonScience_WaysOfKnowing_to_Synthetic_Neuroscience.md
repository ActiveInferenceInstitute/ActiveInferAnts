# PhD Dissertation Plan: Non-Science Ways of Knowing in Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing—such as intuitive, experiential, and cultural methodologies—with the empirical frameworks of neuroscience. By establishing a comprehensive research agenda, this work aims to create an integrative framework that enhances our understanding of neural processes, subjective experiences, and holistic mental health approaches. The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape neuroscience, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and address complex challenges in mental health, education, and societal well-being.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of non-science ways of knowing and neuroscience represents a paradigm shift in understanding human cognition and behavior. Non-science ways of knowing emphasize holistic perspectives, personal experiences, and cultural narratives, while neuroscience relies on empirical methodologies to explore the brain's structure and function. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, offering a new lens through which to investigate and interpret neural processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional reductionist approach of neuroscience, advocating for a more inclusive understanding of knowledge. By integrating non-scientific epistemologies, we can address the limitations of current neuroscience paradigms, particularly in understanding consciousness, emotion, and social behavior. This novel approach fosters a more comprehensive understanding of mental health and cognitive processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing be integrated into neuroscience research?
2. What are the neural correlates of intuitive and experiential knowledge?
3. How can this integration inform therapeutic practices and educational frameworks?
4. What new hypotheses can be generated from this interdisciplinary approach?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
1. **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Examination of indigenous knowledge systems, philosophical traditions, and the evolution of holistic methodologies.
2. **Neuroscience**: Overview of the historical development of neuroscience, key milestones in understanding the nervous system, and the rise of empirical methodologies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
1. **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Current trends emphasizing the value of subjective experience and cultural narratives in addressing global challenges.
2. **Neuroscience**: Recent advancements in understanding neuroplasticity, neural circuits, and the limitations of traditional empirical approaches.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between subjective experiences and empirical research in neuroscience.
- Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance understanding of cognitive processes and mental health.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
1. **Constructivism**: Understanding knowledge as constructed through experience.
2. **Reductionism**: The approach of breaking down complex systems into simpler components.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
1. **Holistic Neuroplasticity**: Understanding neuroplastic changes through a holistic lens, incorporating emotional and cultural dimensions.
2. **Narrative Neuroscience**: Exploring how narratives influence neural processes and subjective experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that incorporates elements of both domains, emphasizing the interplay between empirical research and non-science ways of knowing.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methodologies to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into neuroscience.

### Data Collection Methods
1. **Qualitative**: Interviews, narrative inquiries, and focus groups with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.
2. **Quantitative**: Experimental studies utilizing neuroimaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with intuitive decision-making and artistic expression.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical analysis for quantitative data, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of findings.

### Ethical Considerations
- Addressing ethical concerns related to cultural sensitivity, informed consent, and the respectful engagement of indigenous knowledge systems.
