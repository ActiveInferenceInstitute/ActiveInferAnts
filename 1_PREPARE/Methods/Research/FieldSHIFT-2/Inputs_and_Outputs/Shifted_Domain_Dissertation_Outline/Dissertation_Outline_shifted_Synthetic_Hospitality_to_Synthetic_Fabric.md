## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long been recognized for its emphasis on guest experience, focusing on personalized service and quality interactions. In contrast, the fabric industry has predominantly operated within a framework of mass production and fast fashion. However, the growing demand for customization and sustainability presents an opportunity to merge these domains.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel lens through which to view the fabric industry, advocating for a shift towards a more customer-centric approach. By leveraging insights from guest experience, the study aims to foster innovation and responsiveness within the fabric sector.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be effectively transposed to enhance customer satisfaction in the fabric industry?
2. What frameworks can be developed to measure service quality in fabric retail environments?
3. How can technology be integrated into the fabric design process to create a more engaging customer experience?
