# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Integration of Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference in Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, as exemplified by RxInfer.jl, into the field of game design. By analyzing the intersections between these domains, the research will establish a novel framework for adaptive game mechanics and narrative structures that respond dynamically to player behavior. The findings promise to revolutionize player engagement, enhance the realism of non-player character (NPC) interactions, and inform the development of personalized gaming experiences. This work will contribute significantly to both fields, offering insights into new methodologies, theoretical constructs, and practical applications.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking intersection of probabilistic programming, specifically through RxInfer.jl, and game design. Probabilistic programming allows for the modeling of uncertainty in decision-making, while game design focuses on creating engaging and immersive experiences. This dissertation seeks to merge these disciplines to create innovative game mechanics that adapt to player behavior.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine game design through the lens of probabilistic modeling. By employing Bayesian inference techniques, game designers can create systems that learn from player interactions, enhancing engagement and satisfaction. This novel approach not only addresses existing challenges in game design but also opens avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
