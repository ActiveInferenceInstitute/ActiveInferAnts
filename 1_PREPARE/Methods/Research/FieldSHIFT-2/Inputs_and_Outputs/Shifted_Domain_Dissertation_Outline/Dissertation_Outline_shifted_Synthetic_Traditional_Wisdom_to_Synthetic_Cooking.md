# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Traditional Knowledge in the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Cuisine, proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates sustainable practices, cultural identity, and community engagement into culinary arts. By examining the historical and contemporary significance of both domains, this research aims to uncover the transformative potential of traditional culinary practices in addressing modern challenges such as globalization, health issues, and environmental sustainability. The findings are expected to have profound implications for culinary education, industry practices, and policy-making, ultimately fostering a renaissance in how we understand and engage with food.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of Traditional Knowledge and Cuisine, two previously distinct fields that have significant implications for sustainability and cultural heritage. Traditional Knowledge, often rooted in indigenous practices, emphasizes holistic understanding and ecological stewardship. Cuisine, on the other hand, reflects cultural identities and historical influences on food practices. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, highlighting their interconnectedness and potential for innovation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable culinary practices in an era of globalization and environmental degradation. By integrating TK into modern culinary practices, we can promote biodiversity, enhance community resilience, and preserve cultural heritage. The novelty lies in the development of a new theoretical framework that redefines culinary practices through the lens of traditional ecological knowledge.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can traditional knowledge inform sustainable culinary practices?
2. In what ways can the integration of TK into cuisine enhance cultural identity and community engagement?
3. What are the implications of this integration for culinary education and industry practices?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Traditional Knowledge**: Evolution over millennia, adaptation to environmental changes, and the role of indigenous worldviews.
- **Cuisine**: Historical development influenced by trade, migration, and cultural exchange.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Traditional Knowledge**: Recognition of its value in contemporary environmental management and health practices.
- **Cuisine**: Challenges posed by globalization and modern conveniences, alongside a resurgence of interest in local and sustainable food practices.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Limited research on the integration of TK into culinary practices.
- Opportunities for interdisciplinary studies that combine anthropology, ecology, and culinary arts.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Ecological Sustainability**: Principles of resource management and biodiversity from TK.
- **Cultural Identity**: The significance of food in cultural practices and community cohesion.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Eco-Culinary Framework**: A model that integrates sustainable practices and traditional knowledge into culinary arts.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A holistic approach that emphasizes the interconnectedness of food, culture, and environment, fostering an understanding of cuisine as a dynamic system influenced by traditional practices.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of TK into culinary practices.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Interviews**: Conduct interviews with chefs, traditional knowledge keepers, and community members.
- **Workshops**: Organize culinary workshops to observe traditional cooking methods and community engagement.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis**: Analyze qualitative data from interviews and workshops to identify key themes and patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare dishes prepared using traditional knowledge-informed techniques with modern methods.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensure respectful engagement with traditional knowledge keepers and communities, obtaining informed consent and recognizing cultural sensitivities.
