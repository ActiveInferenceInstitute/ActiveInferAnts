# PhD Dissertation Plan: Domain Transposition - Traditional Knowledge in the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) into modern culinary practices. By analyzing the principles, methodologies, and cultural significance of TK alongside contemporary culinary paradigms, this research seeks to establish a new framework that promotes sustainability, cultural identity, and ecological stewardship. The outcomes of this study will not only contribute to the academic discourse surrounding food studies but will also have practical implications for culinary education, industry practices, and community engagement. Ultimately, this work aspires to foster a richer, more inclusive culinary landscape that honors tradition while embracing innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and contemporary cuisine represents an innovative approach to food systems that emphasizes sustainability, cultural heritage, and holistic practices. This shift acknowledges the importance of indigenous wisdom and local practices in addressing modern culinary challenges.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two previously distinct fields—traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary culinary arts—creating new opportunities for sustainable practices. The novelty lies in the proposed Culinary Biodiversity Model and the concept of Culinary Stewardship, which reframe how we view food sourcing and preparation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Traditional Knowledge inform and enhance modern culinary practices?
- What are the implications of integrating sustainable practices in contemporary cuisine?
- How does the incorporation of culinary rituals influence community engagement and cultural identity?
