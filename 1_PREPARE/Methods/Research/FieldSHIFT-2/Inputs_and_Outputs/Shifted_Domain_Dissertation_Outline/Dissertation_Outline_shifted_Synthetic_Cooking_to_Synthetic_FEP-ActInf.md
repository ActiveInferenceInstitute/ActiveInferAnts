# PhD Dissertation Plan: Culinary Practices through the Lens of the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of culinary practices and the Free Energy Principle, proposing a framework that views cuisine as an adaptive system striving to minimize free energy. By analyzing how flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and culinary fusion can be understood through predictive coding and variational free energy, this research seeks to redefine culinary arts and enhance the dining experience. The potential impact of this work extends to culinary education, technological innovations in cooking, and interdisciplinary collaborations, ultimately revolutionizing our understanding of cuisine.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of culinary arts and the Free Energy Principle represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding cooking as a dynamic, adaptive system. Traditional culinary practices have often been viewed in isolation, neglecting the cognitive and environmental factors that influence flavor optimization. The Free Energy Principle, rooted in cognitive neuroscience and systems theory, offers a framework to analyze these practices in a novel context.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields—culinary arts and cognitive science—creating a new paradigm for understanding and innovating culinary practices. By applying principles of predictive coding and free energy minimization, the dissertation will provide insights into how chefs can refine their techniques and enhance flavor experiences.
