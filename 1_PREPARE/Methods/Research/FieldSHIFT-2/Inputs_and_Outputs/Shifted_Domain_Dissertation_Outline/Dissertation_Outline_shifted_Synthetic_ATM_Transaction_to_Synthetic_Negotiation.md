# PhD Dissertation Plan: From ATM Transactions to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating principles from ATM transactions into negotiation practices. By examining the user-centric design, structured processes, and security measures inherent in ATM systems, this research aims to develop a novel framework for negotiation that enhances efficiency, trust, and user experience. The implications of this work extend beyond negotiation theory, offering insights into technology integration, interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical applications in various sectors. This dissertation seeks to establish a new paradigm in negotiation, leveraging technology to facilitate better outcomes.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The advent of self-service technology, particularly ATMs, has revolutionized banking by providing users with autonomy, efficiency, and security. In parallel, negotiation has evolved from adversarial methods to more collaborative approaches. This dissertation posits that the principles governing ATM transactions can be effectively transposed to enhance negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct domains, creating a new interdisciplinary field that explores the intersection of technology and negotiation. The novelty lies in applying ATM principles—such as structured transaction flows, user feedback mechanisms, and security protocols—to develop a comprehensive negotiation framework that addresses current challenges in negotiation practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the structured processes of ATM transactions inform and improve negotiation practices?
2. What technological innovations can be developed to facilitate self-service negotiation?
3. How can the integration of ATM principles enhance trust and security in negotiations?

## Literature Review
