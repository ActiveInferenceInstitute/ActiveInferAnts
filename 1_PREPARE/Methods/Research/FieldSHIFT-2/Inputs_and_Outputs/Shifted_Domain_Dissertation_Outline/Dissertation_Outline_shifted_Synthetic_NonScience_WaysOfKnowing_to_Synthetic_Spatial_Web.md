# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing—such as intuition, cultural narratives, and emotional intelligence—into the Spatial Web, which encompasses the convergence of physical and digital spaces through technologies like AR, VR, IoT, and AI. By creating a framework that values holistic understanding, emotional engagement, and cultural context, this research will challenge traditional paradigms of knowledge production and technology design. The findings are expected to have significant implications for education, industry practices, and societal engagement, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and empathetic digital landscape.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of non-science ways of knowing with the Spatial Web represents a novel approach to understanding and interacting with our increasingly digital world. Non-science ways of knowing provide a rich tapestry of subjective experiences, cultural traditions, and holistic perspectives that can enhance the design and functionality of digital environments.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of traditional scientific approaches by incorporating diverse ways of knowing that reflect the complexity of human experience. It seeks to redefine how we engage with technology, making it more responsive to emotional and cultural dimensions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing inform the design and functionality of the Spatial Web?
- What are the implications of integrating emotional and cultural narratives into digital environments?
- How can this integration enhance user engagement and understanding in the Spatial Web?
