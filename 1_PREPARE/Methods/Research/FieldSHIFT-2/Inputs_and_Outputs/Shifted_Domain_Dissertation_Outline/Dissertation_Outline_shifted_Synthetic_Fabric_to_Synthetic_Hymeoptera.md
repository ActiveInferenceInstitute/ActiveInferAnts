# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the innovative intersection between the fabric industry and the biological domain of Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees. By analyzing the structural, ecological, and cultural parallels between textile design and the architecture of insect nests, this research aims to develop a new theoretical framework, "Biotextiles," which will provide insights into sustainable design practices and ecological conservation. The findings have the potential to revolutionize both the fields of textile arts and ecological studies, contributing to sustainable practices in design and enhancing our understanding of the cultural significance of Hymenoptera.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long been a canvas for human creativity, encompassing design, sustainability, and cultural expression. Concurrently, Hymenoptera represent a complex biological domain characterized by intricate social structures and environmental adaptations. This dissertation aims to fuse these two domains by exploring how textile design principles can inform and enhance our understanding of Hymenoptera.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on both fields, addressing the urgent need for sustainable practices in the fabric industry while simultaneously highlighting the ecological importance of Hymenoptera. The novelty lies in the application of artistic principles to biological structures, creating a new lens through which to view both art and ecology.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of textile design be applied to understand and interpret the architecture and behavior of Hymenoptera?
2. In what ways can the ecological practices of Hymenoptera inform sustainable practices in the fabric industry?
3. What new theoretical models can emerge from the intersection of these two domains?
