# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive security and the spatial web, proposing a comprehensive framework that integrates cognitive integrity principles into immersive digital environments. By addressing the unique challenges posed by misinformation and cognitive manipulation in augmented and virtual realities, this research seeks to enhance user resilience, promote digital literacy, and establish trust in the spatial web. The anticipated impact includes advancing theoretical constructs, developing practical applications, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a safer and more informed digital landscape.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges cognitive security—focused on protecting cognitive processes and information integrity—with the spatial web, which integrates physical and digital realms through technologies like AR, VR, and IoT. This fusion addresses the increasing complexity of information interactions and the need for robust mechanisms to safeguard users from cognitive threats.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
