# PhD Dissertation Plan: Negotiation in the Context of the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and the Spatial Web, a domain that merges physical and digital interactions. By developing a comprehensive framework for "Spatial Negotiation," this research aims to enhance user experiences, optimize resource management, and foster collaborative environments. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation practices in virtual spaces, offering new methodologies and tools that address contemporary challenges in communication, cultural awareness, and data-driven decision-making. This dissertation will contribute to both theoretical understanding and practical applications in negotiation and spatial technologies, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The concept of negotiation has traditionally been confined to interpersonal and organizational contexts. Meanwhile, the Spatial Web integrates augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create immersive environments that redefine user interactions. The fusion of these domains presents unique challenges and opportunities for negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the gap between traditional negotiation frameworks and the emerging needs of the Spatial Web. By proposing a new model of negotiation that incorporates spatial data and digital interactions, this dissertation aims to enhance collaborative decision-making and user engagement in virtual environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into the Spatial Web?
2. What are the implications of spatial data on negotiation strategies and outcomes?
3. How can cultural and contextual sensitivity improve negotiation practices in virtual spaces?
