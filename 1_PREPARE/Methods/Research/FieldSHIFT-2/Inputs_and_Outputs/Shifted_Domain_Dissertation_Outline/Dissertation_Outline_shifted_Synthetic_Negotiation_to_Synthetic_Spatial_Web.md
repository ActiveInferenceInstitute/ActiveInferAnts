# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into the Context of the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating negotiation principles within the Spatial Web, a domain that merges physical and digital interactions. By analyzing the intersection of negotiation methodologies and Spatial Web technologies, this research seeks to establish a new framework for conducting negotiations in immersive environments. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance negotiation outcomes, promote cultural understanding, and address ethical concerns in digital interactions. The findings could lead to innovative applications in various fields, including business, diplomacy, and education, thereby revolutionizing how negotiations are conducted in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of two historically distinct fields: negotiation and the Spatial Web. Negotiation has evolved through centuries, adapting to cultural and technological changes, while the Spatial Web is an emerging paradigm that integrates augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create interactive digital environments. This dissertation will investigate how the principles of negotiation can be effectively transposed into these immersive spaces.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by the Spatial Web, particularly in the context of negotiation. By reimagining negotiation practices within virtual environments, this dissertation seeks to contribute to the understanding of how technology can facilitate more effective and inclusive negotiation processes. The novelty lies in the development of an integrated theoretical model that combines negotiation strategies with Spatial Web technologies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be adapted to enhance interactions within the Spatial Web?
2. What are the implications of virtual negotiation environments on negotiation outcomes?
3. How can emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, support ethical negotiation practices in digital contexts?
