# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into RxInfer.jl for Probabilistic Modeling

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) into the probabilistic programming framework of RxInfer.jl. By bridging the gap between indigenous ecological wisdom and modern Bayesian inference techniques, this research aims to develop a novel modeling approach that enhances sustainability, community resilience, and ecological understanding. The findings will not only contribute to the fields of environmental science and data science but also foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately leading to innovative solutions for pressing global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of Traditional Knowledge into RxInfer.jl represents a significant shift in how we approach environmental modeling. Traditional Knowledge, developed over generations by indigenous and local communities, emphasizes sustainability and holistic understanding of ecosystems. RxInfer.jl, a cutting-edge probabilistic programming tool, offers a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling complex systems but often lacks the contextual depth provided by TK.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it seeks to harmonize two distinct yet complementary domainsâ€”traditional ecological practices and modern probabilistic modeling. By incorporating TK into RxInfer.jl, we can create models that not only predict outcomes but also reflect the ecological and cultural nuances of the environments they represent. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize environmental management practices and inform policy decisions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Knowledge be effectively integrated into RxInfer.jl to enhance probabilistic modeling?
2. What are the implications of this integration for sustainability and community resilience?
3. How can the newly developed models inform decision-making in environmental management?
