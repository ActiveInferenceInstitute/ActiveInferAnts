# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Cuisine through Logistics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of logistics and cuisine, proposing a novel framework that integrates supply chain management principles into culinary practices. By examining the underlying structures, processes, and methodologies of both domains, this research aims to enhance food quality, sustainability, and efficiency. The potential impact of this work extends beyond culinary arts to influence logistics, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, paving the way for new interdisciplinary collaborations and educational paradigms.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of logistics and cuisine represents a transformative paradigm in both fields. Logistics, traditionally focused on the efficient movement and storage of goods, can enhance culinary practices by optimizing ingredient sourcing, preparation, and delivery. Conversely, the culinary domain can benefit from logistics principles to address challenges such as food waste, sustainability, and dietary restrictions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a systematic approach to culinary logistics, offering a fresh perspective on how food is sourced, prepared, and consumed. The novelty lies in the application of logistics methodologies to culinary practices, thus creating a new interdisciplinary field that bridges gaps between food science, supply chain management, and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles improve the efficiency and sustainability of culinary practices?
2. What are the potential benefits of integrating supply chain management in the culinary domain?
3. How does the application of just-in-time and optimization techniques influence food quality and waste reduction?
