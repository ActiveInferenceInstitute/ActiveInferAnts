# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The evolution of banking technology has led to the widespread adoption of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), which facilitate self-service banking. Simultaneously, Python has emerged as a versatile programming language widely used in various fields, including web development, data science, and automation. This dissertation investigates the intersection of these two domains, leveraging the principles of ATM transactions to inform and enhance Python programming practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both ATM technology and Python programming. By synthesizing knowledge from these two fields, it aims to create a framework that not only improves user experience but also enhances security in software applications. The novelty lies in the application of ATM design principles to Python, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can ATM transaction principles be integrated into Python programming to enhance user experience?
2. What methodologies can be developed to ensure secure coding practices in Python applications, inspired by ATM transaction protocols?
3. What are the implications of this integration for the future of software development in the financial sector?
