# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience from Hospitality to Exercise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative transposition of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into the field of exercise. Given the increasing dropout rates in exercise programs and the need for enhanced participant engagement, this research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that emphasizes personalization, community involvement, and technology integration. By examining the intersection of these two domains, the dissertation will contribute significantly to both fields, offering new methodologies, theoretical constructs, and practical applications that can redefine participant experiences in exercise.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalization, service quality, and technology integration. Conversely, the exercise domain has primarily emphasized physical activity and health benefits, often neglecting the holistic experience of participants. This dissertation proposes a new paradigm that merges these two perspectives, creating a framework for enhancing participant engagement in exercise through guest experience principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the critical issue of low retention rates in exercise programs by applying proven hospitality strategies. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. By drawing parallels between the two domains, this dissertation will provide fresh insights and practical solutions to enhance participant experiences in exercise.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can guest experience principles from hospitality be effectively transposed to enhance participant experiences in exercise?
2. What methodologies can be developed to implement these principles in exercise programs?
3. What are the expected outcomes of integrating personalization, community, and technology in exercise experiences?
