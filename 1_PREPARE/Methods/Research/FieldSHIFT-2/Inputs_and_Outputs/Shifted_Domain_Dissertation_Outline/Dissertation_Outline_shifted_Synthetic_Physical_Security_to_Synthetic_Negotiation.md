# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Applying Physical Security Principles to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of physical security principles into negotiation practices, proposing a transformative framework that enhances negotiation strategies and outcomes. By examining the layered approaches, access control mechanisms, and information-gathering techniques inherent in physical security, this research aims to develop a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that can revolutionize negotiation theory and practice. The potential impact includes improved negotiation efficiency, stronger stakeholder engagement, and the emergence of new interdisciplinary fields. This comprehensive plan outlines a structured approach to investigate these themes, providing a roadmap for significant contributions to both physical security and negotiation domains.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of physical security and negotiation represents a novel approach to understanding and improving negotiation processes. Physical security focuses on protecting assets through various strategies, while negotiation centers on dialogue and agreement-making. By applying the principles of physical security to negotiation, this research seeks to uncover new insights and methodologies that can enhance negotiation effectiveness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering fresh perspectives on negotiation challenges. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of security principles to negotiation contexts, creating a framework that can be empirically tested and applied across various scenarios.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of physical security enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of these fields?
3. How does the application of layered approaches and access control improve negotiation outcomes?
