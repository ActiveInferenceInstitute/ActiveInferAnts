## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has evolved from providing basic services to curating personalized guest experiences, focusing on emotional engagement and community building. Concurrently, RxInfer.jl has emerged as a powerful tool for probabilistic programming, leveraging Bayesian inference and message-passing algorithms. The intersection of these two domains presents an opportunity to enhance user experience in probabilistic programming by applying insights from the hospitality sector.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, merging concepts from hospitality and technology to create a user-centric framework for probabilistic programming. By prioritizing user experience, this dissertation aims to address existing gaps in RxInfer.jl, making it more accessible and effective for a wider audience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience be integrated into the design and functionality of RxInfer.jl?
2. What impact does user-centered design have on the effectiveness and satisfaction of users interacting with probabilistic programming tools?
3. How can feedback mechanisms enhance the adaptability and responsiveness of probabilistic models?
