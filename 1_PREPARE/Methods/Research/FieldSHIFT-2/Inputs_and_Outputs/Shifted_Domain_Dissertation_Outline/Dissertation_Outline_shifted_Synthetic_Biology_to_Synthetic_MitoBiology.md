## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of ecology and cellular biology, focusing on the intricate relationships and interactions within mitochondrial systems. Historically, mitochondria have been viewed primarily as energy-producing organelles, while ecosystems have been studied for their complex interdependencies among species. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, providing a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial functionality through the lens of ecological principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional view of mitochondria and highlights their complexity and adaptability. By applying ecological concepts such as biodiversity, energy flow, and resilience to mitochondrial biology, this dissertation introduces a fresh perspective that may lead to innovative approaches in treating mitochondrial dysfunction and related diseases.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecological principles be applied to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial functionality?
