# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of neuroscience and traditional knowledge, proposing a transformative framework that reinterprets traditional ecological and cultural practices through the lens of neurobiological principles. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of community resilience, adaptability, and sustainability in the face of environmental challenges. By establishing a novel interdisciplinary approach, this study aims to bridge the gap between scientific inquiry and indigenous wisdom, ultimately contributing to both academic discourse and practical applications in ecology, health, and cultural preservation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a unique intersection of neuroscience—focused on the structure and function of the nervous system—and traditional knowledge, which encompasses indigenous wisdom and sustainable practices. This fusion allows for a deeper understanding of how communities adapt to their environments and preserve their cultural identities.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it challenges conventional boundaries between scientific disciplines and traditional practices. By applying neurobiological concepts to the study of traditional knowledge, this dissertation seeks to validate and elevate indigenous wisdom within academic and practical contexts.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of neuroscience be applied to understand traditional knowledge systems?
2. What is the role of community structures in the transmission and adaptation of traditional practices?
3. How does the adaptability of traditional knowledge influence community resilience in changing environments?
