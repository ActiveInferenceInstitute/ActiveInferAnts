# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into the Context of Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating neuroscience with traditional knowledge systems. By examining the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research seeks to develop novel theoretical constructs and practical applications that enhance our understanding of knowledge transmission, resilience, and community dynamics. The findings could significantly impact both fields, fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and promoting sustainable practices rooted in cultural wisdom.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Neuroscience, with its emphasis on the brain's structure and function, has traditionally been viewed as a purely scientific domain. In contrast, traditional knowledge encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities, focusing on sustainable living and ecological stewardship. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by identifying parallels and integrating concepts from neuroscience into the framework of traditional knowledge.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The proposed research is significant as it offers a new lens through which to view traditional knowledge, framing it as a dynamic and adaptive system akin to neural networks. This novel perspective not only enriches our understanding of traditional practices but also highlights their relevance in contemporary society, particularly in addressing environmental and social challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience be applied to understand the adaptive nature of traditional knowledge systems?
2. What are the implications of viewing traditional knowledge as a dynamic network similar to neural networks?
3. How can this integration inform policy, education, and community practices?
