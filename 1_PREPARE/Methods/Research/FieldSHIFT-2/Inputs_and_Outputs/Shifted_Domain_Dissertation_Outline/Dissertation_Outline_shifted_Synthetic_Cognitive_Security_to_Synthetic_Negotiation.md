# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Cognitive Security into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating cognitive security principles into negotiation practices. By addressing the cognitive biases and misinformation tactics that can influence negotiation outcomes, the research proposes new methodologies and frameworks that enhance negotiation effectiveness and transparency. The significance of this work lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging cognitive security and negotiation to create a novel field of study with wide-ranging implications for academia, industry, and society.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a unique convergence of cognitive security—a field dedicated to protecting cognitive processes from manipulation—and negotiation, which focuses on reaching mutually beneficial agreements. Both domains share commonalities in their focus on human behavior, decision-making processes, and the management of information.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only fills existing gaps in both fields but also introduces innovative frameworks that can enhance negotiation processes. The novelty lies in the application of cognitive security principles to negotiation, providing a fresh perspective on how cognitive biases and misinformation can be managed.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can cognitive security principles be effectively integrated into negotiation practices?
- What impact does cognitive bias training have on negotiation outcomes?
- In what ways can misinformation tactics be mitigated during negotiations?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the evolution of cognitive security and its core principles.
- Historical development of negotiation theories and practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Examination of recent advancements in cognitive security technologies and methodologies.
- Analysis of contemporary negotiation strategies and their limitations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Exploration of opportunities for interdisciplinary research and practice.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Cognitive Load Theory and its implications for decision-making.
- Game Theory as it relates to negotiation dynamics.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- The concept of "Cognitive Negotiation" as a framework for understanding the interplay between cognitive security and negotiation.
- The role of emotional intelligence in mitigating cognitive biases during negotiations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that illustrates the interaction between cognitive security principles and negotiation strategies.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research techniques.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiation professionals.
- Experimental studies measuring negotiation outcomes with and without cognitive bias training.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of negotiation outcomes.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent from participants.
- Addressing potential biases in data collection and analysis.
