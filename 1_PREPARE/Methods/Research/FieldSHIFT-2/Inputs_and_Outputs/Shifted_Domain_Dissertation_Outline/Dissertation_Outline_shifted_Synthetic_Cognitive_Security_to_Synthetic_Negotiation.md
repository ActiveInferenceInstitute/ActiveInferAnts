# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of cognitive security principles into negotiation practices, proposing a transformative framework that enhances the integrity, effectiveness, and ethical standards of negotiation. By leveraging insights from cognitive security—focused on protecting cognitive processes from misinformation and manipulation—this research aims to develop new methodologies and training programs that address cognitive biases in negotiation contexts. The anticipated impact of this study includes improved negotiation outcomes, enhanced trust among parties, and the establishment of a new interdisciplinary field bridging cognitive security and negotiation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the convergence of cognitive security and negotiation, two fields that have traditionally operated independently. Cognitive security emphasizes protecting cognitive processes from manipulation, while negotiation focuses on reaching mutually beneficial agreements. This dissertation seeks to explore the synergies between these domains, identifying how cognitive security can inform and enhance negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both cognitive security and negotiation literature. By introducing cognitive security principles into negotiation, the study offers a novel perspective that can lead to more ethical and effective negotiation practices. It is a pioneering effort that not only redefines existing paradigms but also opens new avenues for research and practical application.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles mitigate cognitive biases in negotiation?
2. What new training methodologies can be developed to enhance negotiators' awareness of cognitive threats?
3. In what ways can technological tools be utilized to support cognitive security in negotiation contexts?
4. What are the implications of integrating cognitive security into negotiation for various industries?
