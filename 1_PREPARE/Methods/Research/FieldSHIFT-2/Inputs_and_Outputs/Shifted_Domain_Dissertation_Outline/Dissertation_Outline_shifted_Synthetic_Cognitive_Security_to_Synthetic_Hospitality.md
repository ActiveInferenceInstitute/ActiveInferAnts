# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Cognitive Security Principles into Guest Experience Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of cognitive security principles into guest experience management within the hospitality industry. By addressing cognitive biases, enhancing data integrity, and leveraging technology, this research seeks to redefine guest interactions and improve service quality. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform how hospitality establishments engage with guests, ensuring personalized experiences while maintaining ethical standards in data usage. The outcomes of this research will not only provide theoretical advancements but also practical applications that can revolutionize the hospitality sector.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of cognitive security and guest experience management represents a novel interdisciplinary approach. Cognitive security, focused on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation, has traditionally been applied in areas such as cybersecurity and information integrity. Conversely, guest experience management centers on optimizing every interaction a guest has with a hospitality establishment. This dissertation will investigate how principles from cognitive security can enhance guest experiences by addressing biases, ensuring data integrity, and fostering collaborative engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a framework that merges cognitive security with guest experience management, an area largely unexplored. By developing an understanding of how cognitive biases affect guest perceptions and interactions, this dissertation will provide a new lens through which to view service quality and personalization in hospitality. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which not only fills existing gaps in literature but also offers practical solutions for industry challenges.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- **Research Question 1**: How does bias awareness training for hospitality staff impact guest satisfaction and service quality?
- **Research Question 2**: What role does AI play in analyzing guest feedback to identify cognitive biases in service delivery?
- **Research Question 3**: How can educating guests on feedback literacy improve engagement and brand loyalty?
  
The objectives of this dissertation are to:
1. Develop an integrated theoretical model that combines cognitive security principles with guest experience management.
2. Conduct empirical research to test the proposed hypotheses.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommendations for the hospitality industry.
