# PhD Dissertation Plan: Game Design and the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of game design principles with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference, creating a novel framework for understanding player behavior and cognitive processes. By examining how game mechanics can serve as predictive models that mimic biological adaptation, this research will contribute to both fields, offering new insights into engagement, learning, and adaptive behavior. The potential impact of this work extends to game design, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and education, paving the way for transformative applications and interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the principles of game design—focused on player engagement, mechanics, and narrative—with the theoretical frameworks of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference, which explain how living organisms adapt and minimize surprise in their environments. This fusion presents an opportunity to rethink both domains through a lens of predictive modeling and adaptive learning.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional views of game design and biological systems, suggesting that both domains are governed by similar principles of adaptation and prediction. The novelty lies in the application of complex biological theories to enhance our understanding of player agency and engagement, ultimately creating more immersive and responsive gaming experiences.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles enhance our understanding of active inference in biological systems?
2. What role does player agency play in the minimization of free energy during gameplay?
3. How can the FEP inform the design of adaptive AI systems in gaming?
4. To develop an integrated theoretical model that bridges game design and cognitive science.

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Game Design**: Evolution from simple interactive experiences to complex narratives and mechanics, highlighting milestones such as the advent of 3D graphics and online multiplayer gaming.
- **Free Energy Principle**: Origins in thermodynamics and information theory, evolving into a framework for understanding cognition and behavior across disciplines.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Game Design**: Emphasis on player engagement, feedback loops, and narrative integration, with current trends focusing on virtual reality and inclusivity.
- **FEP & Active Inference**: Established understanding of biological systems as adaptive entities striving to minimize surprise, with applications in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research connecting game design with cognitive science and biological theories.
- Opportunity to create predictive models within game mechanics that reflect biological adaptation processes.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Game Design Principles**: Player engagement, feedback loops, challenge-reward dynamics, and narrative integration.
- **Free Energy Principle**: Predictive coding, active inference, and the minimization of variational free energy.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- The concept of "Predictive Mechanics" in game design, where mechanics adapt based on player behavior.
- "Engagement Feedback Loops" that integrate player actions with game design processes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that positions players as active agents navigating challenges, with game mechanics serving as predictive models for behavior and engagement, mirroring biological processes of active inference.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore player behavior in relation to predictive game mechanics.

### Data Collection Methods
- **User Testing**: Gathering player feedback through playtesting sessions.
- **Surveys and Interviews**: Collecting data on player experiences and emotional responses.
- **Gameplay Analytics**: Analyzing in-game data to track player decisions and adaptations.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of player engagement metrics.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative feedback from surveys and interviews.
- Comparative analysis between traditional game mechanics and predictive mechanics.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality of player data, and addressing potential biases in game design and testing.
