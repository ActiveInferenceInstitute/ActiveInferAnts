# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Ecosystem Concepts into the Free Energy Principle Framework

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of ecological systems and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a transformative framework that reinterprets ecosystems as predictive models. By integrating foundational concepts from ecology with the adaptive dynamics of the FEP, this research seeks to uncover novel insights into ecosystem behavior, resilience, and biodiversity. The implications of this work are far-reaching, offering new methodologies for ecological modeling, conservation strategies, and interdisciplinary education, thereby positioning the research at the forefront of both ecological and cognitive science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Ecosystems and the Free Energy Principle represent two distinct yet increasingly relevant fields. Ecosystems are complex networks characterized by the interactions of organisms and their environments, while the FEP provides a theoretical framework for understanding adaptive systems in both biological and artificial contexts. By transposing concepts from ecosystems into the FEP framework, this research seeks to bridge these domains, fostering a deeper understanding of their interconnectedness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation will pioneer a novel approach that views ecosystems through the lens of predictive processing and active inference, challenging traditional ecological models. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ecological dynamics, enhance conservation efforts, and inform cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ecosystems be modeled as predictive systems within the framework of the Free Energy Principle?
2. What are the implications of viewing biodiversity as a form of predictive diversity in ecosystem resilience?
3. How can active inference inform conservation strategies to enhance ecosystem stability?
