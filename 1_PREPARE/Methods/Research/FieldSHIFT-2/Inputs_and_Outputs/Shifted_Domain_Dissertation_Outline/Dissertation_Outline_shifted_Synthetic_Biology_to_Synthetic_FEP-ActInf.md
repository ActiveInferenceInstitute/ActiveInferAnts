# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Biology (Domain A) and the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference (Domain B). Biology encompasses the study of life, evolution, and ecosystems, while the FEP and AI focus on how adaptive systems minimize surprise and maintain stability. This dissertation seeks to synthesize these fields to create a comprehensive understanding of how ecosystems function as predictive models.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of current ecological models, which often overlook the dynamic interactions within ecosystems. By applying the principles of free energy minimization and active inference to biological systems, this dissertation proposes a novel theoretical framework that can enhance our understanding of ecological resilience and stability.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?
2. What novel hypotheses can be generated from the integration of these domains?
3. How can this new framework inform conservation strategies and biodiversity management?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains
The evolution of Biology has seen significant advancements from early classifications of life to modern molecular biology and ecology. The Free Energy Principle has emerged as a unifying theory in cognitive science and neuroscience, proposing that organisms act to minimize surprise.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current biological research emphasizes the interconnectedness of ecosystems, while the FEP and AI focus on individual adaptive systems. However, there is a lack of integration between these perspectives, leading to gaps in understanding complex ecological dynamics.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of biological principles with the FEP and AI presents opportunities to develop predictive models that account for the dynamic nature of ecosystems. This can lead to a deeper understanding of resilience, stability, and the role of keystone species in ecological systems.
