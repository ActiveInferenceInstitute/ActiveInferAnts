# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of Cuisine

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating concepts from the fabric industry and arts into the culinary domain. By examining the intersections of craftsmanship, sustainability, aesthetics, cultural significance, and innovation, the research will develop a new framework—Culinary Textile Theory—enabling chefs and textile artists to collaborate and innovate. The findings are expected to impact culinary practices, sustainability efforts, and cultural narratives, ultimately enriching the dining experience and promoting environmental stewardship.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry and cuisine are traditionally viewed as separate domains, yet both share core elements such as craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural significance. This dissertation seeks to bridge these fields, creating a new interdisciplinary space where textile arts inform culinary practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The proposed research is significant in its potential to redefine culinary practices through the lens of textile arts, offering novel insights into sustainable cooking, aesthetic presentation, and cultural storytelling. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances culinary innovation but also promotes environmental and cultural sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles from the fabric industry enhance culinary practices?
- What new culinary techniques and aesthetics can emerge from this interdisciplinary fusion?
- How can sustainable practices from the textile industry inform food sourcing and preparation?
