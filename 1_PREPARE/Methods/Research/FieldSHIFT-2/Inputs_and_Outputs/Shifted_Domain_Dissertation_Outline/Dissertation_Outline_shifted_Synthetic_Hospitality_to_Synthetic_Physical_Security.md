# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative transposition of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into the realm of physical security. By merging these two distinct fields, the research aims to redefine security protocols, emphasizing user-centric approaches that enhance satisfaction and compliance. This transformative fusion not only addresses existing gaps in physical security practices but also proposes a new lexicon and theoretical framework that could revolutionize both industries. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academic discourse, promising practical applications in security design, policy formulation, and societal trust in security measures.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience, focusing on personalization, service quality, and emotional engagement. In contrast, physical security has traditionally emphasized protocols and technology, often neglecting the user experience. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, creating a new paradigm that prioritizes user satisfaction within security contexts.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the critical need for user-centric approaches in physical security, an area often overlooked in favor of strict compliance measures. By applying hospitality principles, the study proposes a novel framework that enhances both security effectiveness and user experience, ultimately leading to safer environments.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be effectively integrated into physical security practices?
2. What are the impacts of personalized security experiences on user satisfaction and compliance?
3. How can technology be leveraged to enhance user experience in security settings?
