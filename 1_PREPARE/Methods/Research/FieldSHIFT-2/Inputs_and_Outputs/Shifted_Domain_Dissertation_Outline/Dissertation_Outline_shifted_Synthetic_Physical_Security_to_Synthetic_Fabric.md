# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Physical Security in the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of physical security and the fabric industry, proposing a new framework termed "Textile Security." By integrating principles of physical security into the fabric industry, this research seeks to enhance the protection of designs, materials, and intellectual property while promoting sustainability and innovation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape industry practices, address vulnerabilities, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately leading to a more secure and sustainable future for the fabric industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has historically functioned independently of physical security considerations, focusing primarily on design, production, and distribution. However, as the industry faces increasing challenges related to theft, counterfeiting, and sustainability, there is a pressing need to incorporate security measures that protect both tangible and intangible assets.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a novel perspective on how physical security principles can be applied to the fabric industry. The integration of these domains presents unprecedented opportunities for innovation, resilience, and sustainable practices, ultimately transforming industry standards.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can physical security principles be effectively integrated into the fabric industry?
2. What are the implications of this integration for sustainability and innovation in textile production?
3. How can interdisciplinary collaboration enhance the development and implementation of security measures in the fabric industry?
