# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Free Energy Principle Applied to the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) when applied to the fabric industry and arts. By integrating concepts from cognitive science, systems theory, and sustainable practices, this research will provide a novel framework for understanding and optimizing fabric design, production, and consumer engagement. The study will address critical challenges faced by the fabric industry, including environmental sustainability and consumer alignment, and will propose innovative methodologies that leverage predictive coding and active inference. The anticipated impact of this research extends beyond academia, aiming to influence industry practices, policy frameworks, and educational curricula.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy to maintain their integrity. In contrast, the fabric industry is characterized by its complex interplay of design, production, and consumer behavior. This dissertation will explore how FEP can be transposed into the fabric industry to create a more responsive and sustainable ecosystem.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it bridges cognitive science with textile design, offering a fresh perspective on how adaptive systems can inform and enhance traditional practices in the fabric industry. The novelty lies in the application of theoretical constructs from FEP to real-world challenges, creating an interdisciplinary framework that has the potential to revolutionize the industry.
