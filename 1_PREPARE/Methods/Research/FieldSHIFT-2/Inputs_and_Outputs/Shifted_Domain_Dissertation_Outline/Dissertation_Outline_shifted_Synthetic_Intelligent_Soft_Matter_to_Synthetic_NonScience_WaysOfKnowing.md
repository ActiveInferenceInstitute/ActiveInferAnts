# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Intelligent Soft Matter to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles from intelligent soft matter into non-science ways of knowing. By examining the adaptability and responsiveness inherent in both domains, the research will propose a novel framework for understanding knowledge as a dynamic and evolving entity. This work holds significant implications for education, community resilience, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and holistic approach to knowledge generation.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the principles of intelligent soft matter—materials that sense and respond to environmental stimuli—with non-science ways of knowing, which encompass intuitive, cultural, and experiential forms of understanding. This intersection offers a unique lens through which to examine knowledge systems, fostering a deeper appreciation for both scientific and non-scientific epistemologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional hierarchies of knowledge, advocating for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the value of diverse epistemologies. By integrating intelligent soft matter principles, the study seeks to develop adaptive educational frameworks and community resilience strategies that respect and incorporate local knowledge.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of intelligent soft matter enhance non-science ways of knowing?
2. What new methodologies can be developed to integrate adaptive learning and cultural narratives?
3. In what ways can this integration impact educational practices and community resilience?
