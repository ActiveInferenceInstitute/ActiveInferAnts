# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of William Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions with the principles of traditional knowledge. By examining the interplay between Blake's vision and indigenous wisdom, this research seeks to develop a framework that enriches both domains, fostering a deeper understanding of ecological sustainability and cultural heritage. The potential impact of this work includes revitalizing traditional knowledge systems, informing contemporary environmental practices, and creating new interdisciplinary educational models.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of William Blake's life and work with traditional knowledge represents a unique scholarly endeavor. Blake, a seminal figure of the Romantic era, emphasized imagination, spirituality, and the duality of existence. Traditional knowledge, rooted in the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities, offers a holistic understanding of nature and sustainability. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform and enhance each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to challenge conventional perceptions of both Blake's art and traditional knowledge. By framing traditional practices through Blake's lens of "contraries," this work aims to reveal the dynamic and evolving nature of indigenous knowledge systems. The novelty of this research will contribute to both literary and environmental studies, offering fresh perspectives on the relevance of art in ecological discourse.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can William Blake's philosophies enhance our understanding of traditional knowledge?
2. In what ways can the integration of artistic expression transform the transmission of traditional ecological practices?
3. What new theoretical frameworks emerge from the synthesis of these two domains?
