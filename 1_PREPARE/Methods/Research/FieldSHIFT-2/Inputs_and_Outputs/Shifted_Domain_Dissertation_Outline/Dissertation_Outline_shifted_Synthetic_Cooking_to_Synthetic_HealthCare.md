## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two traditionally distinct fields: culinary arts and healthcare. This intersection provides a unique lens through which to examine patient care, emphasizing the importance of personalization, quality, and holistic approaches in both cooking and health management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional healthcare paradigms by introducing culinary principles that prioritize patient individuality and engagement. The novelty lies in the application of culinary techniques and philosophies to healthcare practices, fostering an environment where patients are viewed as active participants in their care.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary principles enhance patient-centered care in healthcare settings?
2. What frameworks can be developed to integrate culinary concepts into healthcare practices?
3. What are the potential impacts of this integration on patient outcomes, satisfaction, and healthcare delivery?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cuisine:** Historical evolution of culinary practices, including cultural exchanges and technological advancements.
- **Healthcare:** Development of patient-centered care, service quality, and technology integration in healthcare.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Cuisine:** Current trends in nutrition, plant-based diets, and sustainable practices.
- **Healthcare:** Challenges including fragmentation of care, lack of personalized approaches, and insufficient patient engagement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary research between culinary arts and healthcare presents a unique opportunity to innovate patient care models and enhance healthcare delivery through culinary integration.

## Theoretical Framework
