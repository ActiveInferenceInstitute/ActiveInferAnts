# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Cognitive Security into Python Programming

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of cognitive security principles into Python programming practices. By examining the intersection of these two fields, the research aims to develop tools, educational frameworks, and methodologies that enhance software resilience against cognitive threats. The significance of this study lies in its potential to reshape programming practices, promote ethical coding, and foster a more secure digital environment. The findings could lead to the establishment of a new sub-discipline, Cognitive Programming, with broad implications for technology, education, and society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Cognitive security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes against misinformation and cognitive biases, while Python is a widely-used programming language known for its versatility and community support. The shift to integrate cognitive security into Python programming represents a novel approach to enhancing software integrity and user awareness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it merges cognitive security—a field increasingly relevant in the digital age—with Python programming, a language that is foundational in many technological applications. This integration addresses a critical gap in current programming practices, where the psychological aspects of user interaction are often overlooked.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be effectively integrated into Python programming practices?
2. What tools and frameworks can be developed to help programmers mitigate cognitive threats?
3. How can education be restructured to incorporate cognitive security into the programming curriculum?
