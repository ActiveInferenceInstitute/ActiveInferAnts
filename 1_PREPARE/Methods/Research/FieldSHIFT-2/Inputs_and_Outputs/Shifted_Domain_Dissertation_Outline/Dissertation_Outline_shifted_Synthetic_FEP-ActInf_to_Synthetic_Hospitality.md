# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Free Energy Principle & Active Inference Applied to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with the guest experience paradigm in the hospitality industry. It aims to establish a new theoretical framework that enhances guest satisfaction through predictive modeling and adaptive service delivery. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize hospitality management by leveraging interdisciplinary insights, thereby creating a more personalized and responsive guest experience. The anticipated impact extends beyond hospitality, influencing various sectors by demonstrating the applicability of adaptive systems thinking.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference are foundational theories in cognitive science and neuroscience that explain how adaptive systems, including humans, minimize surprise and uncertainty through prediction and feedback mechanisms. The guest experience in hospitality encompasses all interactions between guests and establishments, making it a prime candidate for the application of these theories.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel as it bridges two previously distinct domains—cognitive science and hospitality management—offering a fresh perspective on enhancing guest experiences. By applying principles of FEP and Active Inference, the study aims to develop a framework that integrates predictive analytics into service delivery, thereby improving operational efficiencies and guest satisfaction.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be operationalized to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What predictive models can be developed to accurately forecast guest preferences and behaviors?
3. How does training hospitality staff in active inference techniques impact service recovery and guest retention?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Free Energy Principle:** Originating from neuroscience and cognitive science, FEP illustrates how biological systems maintain homeostasis by minimizing prediction errors.
- **Guest Experience in Hospitality:** The evolution of guest experience theories highlights the shift from service quality to personalized experiences driven by technology and data analytics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **FEP and Active Inference:** Current research emphasizes applications in artificial intelligence and robotics, yet their potential in hospitality remains unexplored.
- **Guest Experience:** The focus has shifted towards personalization and technology integration, but frameworks for predictive modeling are lacking.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
This research identifies a critical gap in applying FEP and Active Inference to hospitality management. The opportunity lies in creating a new model that enhances guest interactions through predictive analytics and active engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Predictive Coding:** A mechanism where the brain generates predictions and updates them based on sensory inputs.
- **Variational Inference:** A statistical method for approximating complex distributions, relevant in understanding guest behaviors.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Predictive Guest Modeling (PGM):** A framework for anticipating guest needs based on historical data and preferences.
- **Active Service Inference (ASI):** A dynamic approach to service delivery that emphasizes real-time adjustments based on guest feedback.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines PGM and ASI to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing guest experiences through predictive analytics and adaptive service delivery.

## Methodology
