# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle into Guest Experience Management

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from cognitive science with Guest Experience Management (GEM) in the hospitality industry. By applying the FEP, which posits that adaptive systems minimize prediction error, this research aims to revolutionize how hospitality businesses understand and enhance guest experiences. The significance of this study lies in its potential to create a predictive framework that aligns service delivery with guest expectations, thereby fostering personalization, improving service recovery, and promoting operational efficiency. The findings are expected to influence both academic discourse and practical applications in the hospitality sector, paving the way for a more adaptive and responsive industry.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) provides a theoretical foundation for understanding adaptive behavior in biological systems, emphasizing the role of prediction and error minimization. Conversely, Guest Experience Management focuses on optimizing interactions between guests and hospitality providers. This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, leveraging insights from FEP to enhance GEM practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it introduces a novel perspective on guest experience through the lens of cognitive science. By utilizing the FEP, the study seeks to establish a new paradigm for understanding guest behavior, leading to improved service design and delivery. The integration of these fields offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation in hospitality management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle be effectively applied to enhance guest experience management?
2. What predictive models can be developed to anticipate guest needs and preferences?
3. In what ways can active inference strategies improve service recovery processes in hospitality?
