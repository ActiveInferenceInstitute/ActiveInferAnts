# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating culinary practices with traditional knowledge systems, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework termed “Culinary Ecology.” By investigating the intersections of cuisine and traditional knowledge, this research will address pressing issues such as biodiversity conservation, cultural identity preservation, and sustainable food systems. The findings will have significant implications for both culinary arts and environmental science, fostering a deeper understanding of how food practices can enhance community resilience and ecological health.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of culinary arts and traditional knowledge. Cuisine, characterized by its diverse techniques, cultural significance, and ecological considerations, intersects with traditional knowledge, which emphasizes sustainability and community identity. This dissertation will examine how these two domains can inform and enrich one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it recognizes the role of culinary practices as vital components of traditional knowledge systems. By bridging these fields, the dissertation will contribute to a deeper understanding of sustainability in food practices, the preservation of cultural identities, and the promotion of biodiversity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary practices serve as a means of preserving traditional ecological knowledge?
2. In what ways do culinary traditions contribute to community resilience and cultural identity?
3. How can modern scientific approaches enhance traditional culinary practices for sustainable outcomes?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Cuisine**: Evolution of culinary practices across cultures; the role of food in social and cultural identity.
- **Traditional Knowledge**: Historical perspectives on indigenous practices and their ecological significance; challenges faced in preserving traditional knowledge.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Examination of contemporary culinary trends emphasizing sustainability.
- Overview of current research on traditional ecological knowledge and its applications in modern contexts.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research combining culinary arts and traditional knowledge.
- Opportunities for new methodologies that integrate culinary practices with ecological sustainability.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Culinary theory: Flavor pairing, cultural significance of food.
- Traditional knowledge theory: Sustainability, ecological balance.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Culinary Ecology: The relationship between culinary practices and local ecosystems.
- Cultural Resilience Model: The interplay between culinary traditions and community resilience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model illustrating the interconnectedness of culinary practices, traditional knowledge, and ecological sustainability, highlighting feedback loops between these elements.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of culinary practices and traditional knowledge.

### Data Collection Methods
- Ethnographic studies: Interviews and participant observations in communities practicing traditional culinary arts.
- Surveys: Gathering quantitative data on culinary practices and their perceived impact on community resilience.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for survey data to identify correlations between culinary practices and ecological outcomes.

### Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent from participants.
- Respect for cultural practices and intellectual property within traditional knowledge systems.
