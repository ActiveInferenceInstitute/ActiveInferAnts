This interdisciplinary approach seeks to bridge gaps between these domains and foster a deeper understanding of how cellular processes can be viewed through the lens of negotiation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a fresh perspective on mitochondrial function, emphasizing dynamic interactions and communication. The novelty lies in the application of negotiation principles to biological processes, potentially leading to groundbreaking insights into cellular health and disease management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be transposed to understand mitochondrial dynamics?
2. What is the role of communication and negotiation in mitochondrial function and health?
3. How can this framework inform therapeutic approaches to mitochondrial dysfunction?
4. What educational strategies can be developed to teach this interdisciplinary perspective?
