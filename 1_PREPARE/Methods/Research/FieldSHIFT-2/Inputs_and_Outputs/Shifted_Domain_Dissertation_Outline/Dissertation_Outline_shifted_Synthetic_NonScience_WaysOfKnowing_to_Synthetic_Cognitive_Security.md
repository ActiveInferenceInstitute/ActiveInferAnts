# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation seeks to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing—such as intuition, tradition, and emotional intelligence—into the field of cognitive security. By highlighting the significance of cultural context and subjective experience, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances resilience against misinformation and cognitive manipulation. The findings will contribute to both theoretical advancements in cognitive security and practical applications in educational and community settings, ultimately fostering a more informed and engaged society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges non-science ways of knowing with cognitive security, representing a novel interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the limitations of traditional empirical methodologies. This fusion emphasizes the importance of holistic understanding, emotional intelligence, and cultural narratives in addressing cognitive threats.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing paradigms in cognitive security by advocating for the inclusion of subjective experiences and cultural contexts. The novelty lies in proposing a framework that integrates diverse epistemologies, thereby enriching cognitive security strategies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance cognitive security frameworks?
2. What are the implications of integrating emotional intelligence and cultural narratives in combating misinformation?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach be implemented in educational and community settings?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Exploration of indigenous knowledge systems, emotional intelligence, and holistic approaches.
- **Cognitive Security**: Historical evolution in response to digital communication and the rise of misinformation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Review of existing literature on cognitive biases, misinformation, and the role of emotional intelligence in decision-making.
- Examination of the growing recognition of non-science ways of knowing in contemporary research.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identification of gaps in current cognitive security strategies that overlook emotional and cultural dimensions, as well as opportunities for integrating these perspectives into practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Emphasizing experiential learning and the role of cultural narratives.
- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: Understanding how misinformation creates psychological discomfort and how emotional intelligence can mitigate this.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Holistic Cognitive Security Model**: A framework that integrates emotional intelligence, cultural narratives, and experiential learning into cognitive security strategies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
Development of a model that illustrates the interconnections between non-science ways of knowing and cognitive security, highlighting the importance of context and subjective experience.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into cognitive security.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys**: Assessing the awareness and understanding of cognitive security concepts among diverse populations.
- **Interviews**: Conducting in-depth interviews with experts in cognitive security, psychology, and cultural studies.
- **Workshops**: Implementing community workshops to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating non-science ways of knowing into cognitive security education.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis**: Analyzing qualitative data from interviews and workshops to identify key themes and insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using quantitative methods to measure the impact of emotional intelligence training on cognitive resilience.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and cultural sensitivity throughout the research process, particularly when engaging with indigenous and marginalized communities.
