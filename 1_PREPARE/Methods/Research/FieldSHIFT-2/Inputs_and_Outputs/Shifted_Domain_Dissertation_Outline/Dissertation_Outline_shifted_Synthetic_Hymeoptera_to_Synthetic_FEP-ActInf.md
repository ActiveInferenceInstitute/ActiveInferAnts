# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Hymenoptera to the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the study of Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) in cognitive science. By analyzing the complex social structures and adaptive behaviors of Hymenoptera through the lens of the FEP, this research seeks to uncover transformative insights into collective intelligence, communication strategies, and adaptive systems. The potential impact of this work extends across multiple disciplines, including biology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and social dynamics, offering new frameworks for understanding and designing complex adaptive systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: the biological study of Hymenoptera, known for their intricate social structures and adaptive behaviors, and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that living systems minimize free energy to maintain homeostasis. This intersection provides fertile ground for exploring how biological principles can inform cognitive and social systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge biological and cognitive sciences, providing a novel framework for understanding collective intelligence and adaptive behaviors. By transposing concepts from Hymenoptera to the FEP, the research will contribute to a deeper understanding of both domains, revealing new insights into social behavior, decision-making, and resource allocation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can insights from Hymenoptera inform models of collective decision-making in human systems?
2. What parallels exist between the communication strategies of Hymenoptera and neural predictive coding in human cognition?
3. How do adaptive structures in nature inform the design of artificial intelligence systems based on the Free Energy Principle?
