# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Hymenoptera into the Context of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Hymenoptera biology and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI), creating a new framework for understanding adaptive systems. By transposing concepts from the intricate social behaviors of ants, bees, and wasps into the theoretical constructs of FEP, this research seeks to uncover novel insights into collective intelligence, adaptive architecture, foraging strategies, and defense mechanisms. The findings have the potential to revolutionize fields such as cognitive science, robotics, and ecological management, while also informing interdisciplinary education and policy-making. 

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel integration of Hymenoptera behavior and the Free Energy Principle, which posits that biological systems minimize free energy to maintain homeostasis. This research will investigate how these insectsâ€™ collective behaviors align with predictive coding, active inference, and variational free energy.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This dissertation presents an unprecedented approach to understanding complex adaptive systems by merging biological insights with theoretical frameworks from cognitive science. The significance lies in its potential to develop new models of behavior that can be applied across various disciplines.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How do the collective decision-making processes of Hymenoptera reflect principles of predictive coding and active inference?
2. In what ways can the architecture of ant nests be understood through the lens of variational free energy?
