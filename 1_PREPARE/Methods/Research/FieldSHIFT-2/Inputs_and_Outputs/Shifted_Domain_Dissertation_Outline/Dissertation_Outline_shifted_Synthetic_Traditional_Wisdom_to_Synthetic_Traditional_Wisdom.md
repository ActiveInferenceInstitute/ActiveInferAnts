# Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the fusion between Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Modern Environmental Sustainability. By systematically transposing principles of TK into contemporary sustainability practices, this research aims to develop a new framework for environmental stewardship that is culturally responsive, community-centric, and resilient to climate change. The significance of this study lies in its potential to create innovative strategies that enhance biodiversity, foster community engagement, and promote adaptive management practices. The findings are expected to have far-reaching implications for both academic research and practical applications in environmental policy and community development.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between Traditional Knowledge, which encompasses the cultural, spiritual, and ecological wisdom of indigenous and local communities, and Modern Environmental Sustainability, which focuses on resource management, ecosystem health, and climate change mitigation. The integration of these two fields offers a holistic approach to environmental challenges, recognizing the importance of cultural context in sustainability efforts.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses the urgent need for more inclusive and effective sustainability practices that respect and incorporate the wisdom of indigenous communities. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of TK into modern sustainability frameworks, which has rarely been explored in academic literature. This approach not only honors traditional practices but also enriches contemporary environmental strategies, creating a more comprehensive understanding of sustainability.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Traditional Knowledge be effectively integrated into Modern Environmental Sustainability practices?
2. What are the impacts of culturally responsive sustainability initiatives on community resilience and biodiversity?
3. How can knowledge co-creation between traditional knowledge holders and modern scientists lead to innovative solutions for environmental challenges?
