# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Probabilistic Programming and Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of concepts from RxInfer.jl, a leading probabilistic programming framework, into the realm of traditional knowledge (TK). By transposing Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling principles onto TK, the research seeks to create a novel framework that quantifies and models the uncertainties inherent in traditional ecological practices. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances the understanding of TK but also proposes actionable strategies for sustainable environmental management, thus bridging the gap between indigenous wisdom and modern scientific methodologies. The impact of this research has the potential to revolutionize both fields, fostering collaborative approaches to ecological challenges and promoting cultural preservation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of probabilistic programming and traditional knowledge, where the former provides a rigorous mathematical framework for uncertainty modeling, and the latter embodies centuries of ecological wisdom. This novel intersection offers a fresh perspective on how to approach environmental management and sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to validate and enhance traditional ecological knowledge through quantitative methods. By applying Bayesian inference to TK, we can develop more robust models that respect cultural practices while facilitating adaptability in the face of environmental changes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Bayesian inference be effectively applied to traditional ecological knowledge?
2. What new insights can be gained by modeling TK as probabilistic systems?
3. How can this integration inform sustainable environmental practices and policy?
