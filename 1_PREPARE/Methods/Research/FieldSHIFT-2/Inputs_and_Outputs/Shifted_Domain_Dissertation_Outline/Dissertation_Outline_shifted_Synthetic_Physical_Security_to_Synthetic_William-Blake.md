# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security Concepts to the Study of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between physical security principles and the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in Romantic literature and art. By transposing concepts such as surveillance, access control, and environmental design from physical security into the analysis of Blake's artistic output, this research seeks to uncover new dimensions of meaning and relevance in his work. The significance of this study lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of artistic expression as a form of protection against societal norms and injustices, ultimately contributing to both literary scholarship and security studies.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of physical security principles with the study of William Blake represents a unique interdisciplinary approach that highlights the protective nature of art. Physical security focuses on safeguarding people and assets against threats, while Blake's work critiques societal constraints and elevates the human spirit.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its innovative perspective on how artistic expression can serve as a form of security for the human spirit. By applying security concepts to the analysis of Blake's work, we can gain fresh insights into his artistic intentions and the broader implications of creativity in society.
