## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fields of neuroscience and logistics have historically operated in isolation, each with its own methodologies and applications. Neuroscience focuses on understanding the nervous system's structure and function, while logistics emphasizes the efficient movement and storage of goods. Recent advancements in technology and data analytics have created opportunities to integrate insights from neuroscience into logistics, leading to the emergence of a Shifted Domain.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its potential to transform logistics practices by borrowing concepts from neuroscience, such as neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and decision-making mechanisms. The novelty lies in the application of these concepts to create adaptive, responsive logistics systems that can evolve in real-time, thereby addressing contemporary challenges in supply chain management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience be effectively transposed into logistics systems?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
3. In what ways can the application of neuroscience concepts enhance the adaptability and efficiency of logistics operations?
