# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of intelligent soft matter has its roots in materials science and engineering, transitioning from basic polymer research to advanced materials technology. Similarly, physical security has evolved from simple mechanical systems to complex, technology-driven solutions. Understanding the historical context of both fields is crucial for identifying the opportunities presented by their integration.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Research in intelligent soft matter focuses on developing materials with enhanced functionalities, such as stimuli responsiveness and self-healing capabilities.
