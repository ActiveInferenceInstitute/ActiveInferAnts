# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Study of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the philosophical frameworks of William Blake and the ecological and social structures of Hymenoptera. By leveraging Blake's concepts of imagination, contraries, and interconnectedness, this research seeks to redefine our understanding of social insects, offering fresh insights into their collective intelligence and ecological roles. The potential impact of this work extends beyond entomology, influencing interdisciplinary dialogues in philosophy, art, and environmental science.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the fusion of William Blake's visionary artistic and literary contributions with the complex social behaviors and ecological significance of Hymenoptera. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a deeper exploration of the philosophical underpinnings of biological systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between the humanities and sciences, proposing a novel framework that enhances our understanding of both Blake's art and the ecological importance of Hymenoptera. The study aims to generate new theoretical insights and practical applications that can benefit both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Blake's philosophy of imagination and contraries inform our understanding of collective intelligence in Hymenoptera?
- In what ways do the social structures of Hymenoptera reflect Blake's concepts of duality and interconnectedness?
- What are the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for future research and practical applications?
