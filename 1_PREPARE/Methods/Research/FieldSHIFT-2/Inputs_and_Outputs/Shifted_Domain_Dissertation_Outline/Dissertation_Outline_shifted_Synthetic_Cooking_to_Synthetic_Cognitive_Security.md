# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Culinary Concepts to Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation investigates the innovative intersection between culinary practices and cognitive security, proposing a novel framework that integrates culinary concepts into cognitive security measures. By exploring isomorphisms between flavor profiles, cooking techniques, and cognitive integrity, this research aims to develop new methodologies and frameworks that enhance the resilience of individuals and organizations against cognitive threats. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize cognitive security strategies, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and generating practical applications that can lead to a more informed and secure society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the art and science of culinary practices with the critical field of cognitive security. Culinary practices are characterized by their cultural significance, methodological rigor, and sensory engagement. In contrast, cognitive security focuses on safeguarding cognitive processes from misinformation and manipulation. This dissertation seeks to explore how culinary principles can inform and enhance cognitive security strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The fusion of these two distinct domains presents an unprecedented opportunity to create innovative frameworks that address cognitive vulnerabilities. This research is novel in its approach to apply culinary techniques—such as flavor profiling and mise en place—to the realm of cognitive security, thereby creating a new lexicon and methodologies that can improve information integrity and user engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can culinary concepts be systematically transposed to enhance cognitive security measures?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
3. In what ways can the proposed frameworks improve organizational preparedness against cognitive threats?
