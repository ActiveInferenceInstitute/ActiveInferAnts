# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Logistics into the Context of Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating blockchain technology into logistics, creating a new paradigm referred to as "LogiChain." By examining the synergies between these two distinct fields, the research will address key challenges in logistics, such as transparency, efficiency, and collaboration, through the lens of blockchain's decentralized and immutable characteristics. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both academic literature and industry practices, offering innovative solutions to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve stakeholder trust.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The logistics industry is characterized by the complexities of managing the flow of goods, services, and information. In contrast, blockchain technology offers a decentralized framework for securing transactions and enhancing transparency. The convergence of these fields presents an opportunity to redefine logistics operations through enhanced data integrity and automation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of blockchain into logistics is novel, as it leverages the strengths of both domains to address persistent challenges. This research will pioneer the exploration of smart contracts, decentralized inventory management, and supply chain transparency, providing a new lexicon and theoretical framework to understand this Shifted Domain.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology enhance transparency and efficiency in logistics?
2. What are the implications of smart contracts for logistics operations?
3. How can decentralized inventory management reduce waste and improve resource allocation?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of logistics and blockchain?
