# Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating exercise science with traditional knowledge systems, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters holistic health practices rooted in cultural contexts. By systematically transposing exercise into traditional knowledge, this research will uncover new methodologies, theories, and applications that enhance community well-being and cultural identity. The findings will provide a roadmap for future interdisciplinary studies and practical applications, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable approach to health that respects and revitalizes indigenous wisdom.

# Introduction
## Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between exercise science—a field focused on physical health and fitness—and traditional knowledge, which encompasses the wisdom and practices of indigenous and local communities. This fusion highlights the importance of cultural contexts in health practices and recognizes the value of traditional exercises as vehicles for community engagement and identity.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in current health paradigms by integrating cultural practices into exercise regimens. The novelty lies in the potential to redefine exercise not merely as a physical activity but as a culturally enriched practice that promotes holistic well-being.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can traditional exercises be revitalized and integrated into modern health practices?
2. What are the long-term health impacts of community-based exercise programs that incorporate traditional knowledge?
3. How does integrating exercise into traditional rituals enhance community bonds and cultural identity?
