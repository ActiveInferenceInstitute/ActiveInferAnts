## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of healthcare principles and game design, proposing a transformative framework that enhances player engagement and well-being. By integrating patient-centered care, continuity of experience, and quality engagement metrics from healthcare into game design, this research aims to create a new paradigm that prioritizes player experience while fostering educational and health-promoting narratives. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy frameworks, and societal health outcomes.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of healthcare concepts with game design represents a significant shift in both fields. As the gaming industry evolves, there is a growing recognition of the need for deeper engagement and emotional connection with players. Concurrently, healthcare is increasingly focusing on patient-centered approaches that prioritize individual needs and experiences. This dissertation investigates how these two domains can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both healthcare and game design. By applying healthcare principles to game design, we can create experiences that not only entertain but also educate and promote healthier lifestyles. This novel approach has the potential to revolutionize how games are developed and perceived, shifting the focus from mere entertainment to holistic player engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can healthcare principles be effectively integrated into game design to enhance player engagement and satisfaction?
2. What are the potential impacts of patient-centered gameplay on player retention and emotional investment?
3. In what ways can narrative integration in games address players' emotional and psychological needs?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Healthcare:** Evolution from paternalistic models to patient-centered care, emphasizing collaboration and holistic approaches.
- **Game Design:** Transition from single-player experiences to complex multiplayer interactions, with an increasing focus on player agency and narrative depth.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Healthcare is increasingly leveraging technology for improved patient experiences, while game design is exploring narrative-driven experiences and ethical considerations in monetization.
- Both fields are recognizing the importance of user experience and emotional engagement.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of research on the application of healthcare principles in game design.
- Opportunities to enhance player experiences through personalized and emotionally resonant narratives.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Healthcare:** Patient-centered care, continuity of care, quality of service.
- **Game Design:** Player agency, engagement mechanics, narrative structures.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Player-Centered Design:** A framework that prioritizes individual player experiences and preferences.
- **Continuity of Experience:** Mechanisms that ensure a seamless transition and progression of gameplay.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model combining healthcare principles with game design elements, focusing on player engagement, emotional connection, and educational outcomes.

## Methodology
