# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cuisine into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating culinary practices with non-science ways of knowing. It aims to develop a comprehensive framework that recognizes and values subjective experiences, cultural narratives, and intuitive understanding in both culinary arts and broader knowledge systems. By examining the intersections between these domains, the research seeks to uncover novel insights that can inform educational practices, enhance emotional intelligence, and foster community resilience. The anticipated impact of this work extends to academic discourse, policy-making, and practical applications in various sectors, ultimately contributing to a more holistic understanding of knowledge.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of cuisine and non-science ways of knowing represents a significant shift in how we understand knowledge creation. Cuisine, as a reflection of cultural identities and practices, offers rich narratives and experiential learning opportunities. In contrast, non-science ways of knowing encompass diverse methodologies that prioritize intuition, tradition, and personal experience. This dissertation seeks to illuminate the synergies between these domains, proposing a new lens through which to explore human experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to challenge prevailing paradigms that prioritize scientific knowledge over other forms of understanding. By integrating culinary practices into non-science frameworks, the dissertation aims to validate and elevate subjective experiences, thereby enriching educational curricula and community practices. This novel approach not only fosters interdisciplinary collaboration but also promotes cultural appreciation and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can culinary practices inform and enhance non-science ways of knowing?
- In what ways do cultural narratives embedded in cuisine contribute to community identity and resilience?
- What methodologies can be developed to integrate these domains into educational frameworks?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The literature on cuisine highlights its evolution through cultural exchange, migration, and technological advancements. Non-science ways of knowing have roots in indigenous practices and philosophical traditions, often marginalized in mainstream discourse.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in culinary studies emphasizes the cultural and social dimensions of food, while non-science ways of knowing are increasingly recognized for their holistic perspectives. However, there remains a gap in literature that directly connects these two domains.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The integration of culinary arts with non-science knowledge systems presents opportunities to address complex global challenges, such as food security and cultural preservation. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that bridges these fields.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Cultural Theory:** Examines how cultural practices shape identity and community.
- **Experiential Learning Theory:** Emphasizes learning through direct experience and reflection.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Culinary Intuition Theory:** Proposes that culinary practices enhance intuitive understanding in various contexts.
- **Cultural Recipe Framework:** Suggests that recipes serve as narratives encapsulating cultural knowledge.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model will be developed to illustrate the interplay between culinary practices and non-science ways of knowing, highlighting their shared values and methodologies.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersections between cuisine and non-science knowledge systems.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with chefs, educators, and community members to gather insights on culinary practices and their cultural significance.
- **Surveys:** Distribute surveys to assess the impact of culinary practices on emotional intelligence and decision-making.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis:** Analyze qualitative data to identify common themes and narratives.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Use quantitative methods to examine correlations between culinary engagement and intuitive decision-making.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure informed consent from participants, prioritize cultural sensitivity, and acknowledge the contributions of diverse communities in the research process.
