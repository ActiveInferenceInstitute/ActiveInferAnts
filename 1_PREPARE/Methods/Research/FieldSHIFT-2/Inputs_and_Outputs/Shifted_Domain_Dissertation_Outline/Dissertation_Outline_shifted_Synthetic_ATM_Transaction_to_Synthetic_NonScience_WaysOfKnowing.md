# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing ATM Transactions into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of ATM transactions and non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework that redefines how we understand personal experiences and knowledge acquisition. By analyzing the principles of autonomy, trust, and user-centric design in ATM transactions and juxtaposing them with holistic, subjective, and narrative-driven approaches found in non-science ways of knowing, the research seeks to establish a new paradigm for understanding personal empowerment and ethical decision-making. This work has the potential to impact educational practices, inform policy-making, and foster societal change by valuing diverse knowledge systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of a Shifted Domain that combines ATM transactions with non-science ways of knowing presents a unique opportunity to examine how structured financial interactions can inform and enrich personal knowledge systems. This research explores the isomorphisms between these two domains, proposing that the mechanics of ATM interactions can serve as metaphors for personal growth and understanding.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This study is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms that prioritize empirical knowledge over experiential understanding. By bridging the gap between technology and subjective experience, this research introduces novel insights into personal empowerment, ethical frameworks, and the interconnectedness of knowledge systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of ATM transactions be transposed into frameworks for personal knowledge acquisition?
2. What is the role of subjective experience in shaping ethical decision-making processes?
3. How can this integration inform educational practices and societal understanding of knowledge?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **ATM Transactions**: Evolution from basic cash dispensers to multifunctional machines; technological advancements and consumer expectations.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Historical perspectives on holistic understanding, cultural beliefs, and the validity of subjective experiences.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **ATM Transactions**: Current trends include contactless payments, mobile banking, and user-centric design.
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Emphasis on experiential learning, narrative approaches, and the devaluation of empirical methodologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that integrate empirical and experiential knowledge.
- Opportunities for innovation in educational practices and personal development methodologies.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **User Experience Theory**: Insights into how users interact with technology.
- **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Understanding knowledge acquisition through personal experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Experiential Transaction Theory**: A framework that equates personal experiences with transactional interactions.
- **Holistic Knowledge Integration Model**: A model that combines empirical and non-empirical knowledge systems.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A comprehensive model that illustrates the interplay between ATM transactions and non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing the cyclical nature of learning and personal growth.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the proposed hypotheses.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Qualitative**: Interviews and focus groups exploring personal experiences as 'life ATMs.'
- **Quantitative**: Surveys measuring the impact of experiential learning on ethical decision-making.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis for quantitative data, including regression models to identify relationships between variables.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of data collected from personal narratives.
