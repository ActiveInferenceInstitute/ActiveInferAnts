# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles into Physical Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of health care principles into the field of physical security, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes user experience, psychological well-being, and continuous improvement. By adopting a patient-centered approach in security practices, this research seeks to enhance the effectiveness of security measures while ensuring they do not compromise user comfort and accessibility. The potential impact of this research extends to various sectors, including corporate environments, urban planning, and community safety, ultimately contributing to safer and more supportive spaces.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between health care and physical security, where the principles of patient-centered care, holistic approaches, and quality service are transposed into security practices. This shift recognizes the importance of the user experience in security settings, paralleling the emphasis on patient experience in health care.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional paradigms in physical security, which often prioritize strict access control and surveillance over user comfort. By integrating health care principles, this dissertation aims to create a new framework for security that prioritizes psychological well-being and user satisfaction, ultimately leading to more effective security measures.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can health care principles enhance physical security practices?
2. What are the user experience implications of applying patient-centered care models to security?
3. How does the integration of psychological and emotional considerations into security design affect perceived safety and security effectiveness?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Health Care**: Overview of the evolution of patient-centered care, emphasizing its origins and development in modern health systems.
- **Physical Security**: Examination of the historical development of security measures, focusing on access control and surveillance systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Health Care**: Analysis of contemporary practices emphasizing patient engagement, technology integration, and quality measurement.
- **Physical Security**: Review of current paradigms in security, including user experience challenges and evolving threats.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying gaps in the existing literature where health care principles have not been applied to physical security, highlighting opportunities for interdisciplinary research and practical applications.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Health Care**: Patient-centered care theory, holistic health models, and quality service frameworks.
- **Physical Security**: Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and risk management theories.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **User-Centric Security Theory**: A framework that prioritizes the experience of individuals interacting with security measures.
- **Holistic Security Design Theory**: Integrating psychological and emotional factors into security design.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A comprehensive model that synthesizes health care principles with physical security practices, outlining how these constructs interact to enhance user experience and security effectiveness.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore user experiences and perceptions of security measures.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and questionnaires targeting users of various security environments.
- Focus groups to gather in-depth qualitative insights on user experiences.
- Case studies of organizations implementing user-centric security models.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify trends and correlations.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from focus groups and case studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality, informed consent, and ethical treatment of data, particularly regarding sensitive security information.
