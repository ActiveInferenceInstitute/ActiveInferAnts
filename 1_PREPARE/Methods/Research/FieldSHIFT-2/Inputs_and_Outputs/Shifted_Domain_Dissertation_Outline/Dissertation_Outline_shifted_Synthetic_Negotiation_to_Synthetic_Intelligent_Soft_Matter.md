# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Intelligent Soft Matter

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of negotiation principles into the field of intelligent soft matter, proposing a transformative framework that enhances material design and functionality. By applying concepts such as adaptability, collaboration, and emotional intelligence from negotiation theory, this research aims to develop intelligent materials that respond dynamically to environmental stimuli and user interactions. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, robotics, and environmental sustainability, ultimately contributing to a more responsive and user-centered approach to material science.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of negotiation and intelligent soft matter represents a novel interdisciplinary frontier. Negotiation, traditionally seen as a human-centric dialogue, emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and emotional management. Intelligent soft matter, on the other hand, focuses on materials that can respond to external stimuli, showcasing properties such as self-healing, shape-shifting, and environmental responsiveness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it challenges the conventional boundaries of materials science by introducing negotiation principles into material design. The novelty lies in the potential for materials to "negotiate" their properties, leading to enhanced functionality and user experience. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches the field of intelligent soft matter but also opens new avenues for negotiation theory.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into the design of intelligent soft materials?
- What are the implications of this integration for material functionality and user interaction?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary fusion, and how can they be empirically tested?
