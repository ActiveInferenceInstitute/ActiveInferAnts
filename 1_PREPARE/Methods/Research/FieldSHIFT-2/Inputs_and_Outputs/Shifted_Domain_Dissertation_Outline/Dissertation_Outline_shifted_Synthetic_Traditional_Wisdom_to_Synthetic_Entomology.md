# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating traditional knowledge (TK) with entomology, creating an innovative Shifted Domain that enriches both fields. By examining the synergies between indigenous ecological wisdom and scientific inquiry into insect ecology, the research will address critical gaps in current entomological practices and contribute to sustainable conservation strategies. The study seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding insect populations through the lens of cultural significance and ecological stewardship, ultimately advocating for an interdisciplinary approach that fosters collaboration between indigenous communities and scientific researchers.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of Traditional Knowledge and Entomology, where indigenous practices and beliefs regarding insects and their ecological roles are integrated with scientific methodologies. This integration offers a holistic understanding of ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of insects in maintaining biodiversity and ecological health.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional separation between indigenous knowledge systems and scientific inquiry. By recognizing the value of TK in entomological research, the study promotes a more inclusive approach to ecological management and conservation, addressing pressing global challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can traditional ecological knowledge enhance our understanding of insect populations and their roles in ecosystems?
- What are the implications of integrating TK into contemporary entomological practices for conservation and sustainable agriculture?
- How can participatory research methods facilitate collaboration between indigenous communities and entomologists?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the development of Traditional Knowledge and its historical marginalization in favor of Western scientific paradigms.
- Examination of the evolution of Entomology as a scientific discipline and its current challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Analysis of contemporary research trends in Traditional Knowledge, focusing on its applications in environmental management.
- Review of current entomological research, highlighting gaps in understanding the cultural significance of insects.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Proposing the concept of "Cultural Ecology of Insects" to describe the relationship between human culture and insect populations.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Presentation of a model that illustrates the reciprocal relationship between TK and scientific inquiry in understanding insect ecology.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of TK into entomology.

### Data Collection Methods
- Participatory research involving interviews and workshops with indigenous communities.
- Field studies to collect empirical data on insect populations and their ecological roles.

### Analytical Approaches
- Qualitative analysis of traditional ecological knowledge and its application in insect conservation.
- Statistical analysis of field data to compare indigenous and conventional pest management practices.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring respectful engagement with indigenous communities and obtaining informed consent for research participation.
- Acknowledging and valuing the intellectual property of traditional knowledge holders.
