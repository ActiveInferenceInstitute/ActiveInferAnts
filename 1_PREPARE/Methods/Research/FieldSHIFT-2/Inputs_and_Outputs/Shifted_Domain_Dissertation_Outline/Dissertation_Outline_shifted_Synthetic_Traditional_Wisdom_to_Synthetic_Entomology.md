# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into the field of entomology. By examining the intersections between indigenous practices and modern entomological research, the study seeks to develop innovative, sustainable strategies for insect conservation and management. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance biodiversity, promote cultural resilience, and address the pressing challenges posed by declining insect populations. The findings will contribute to a more inclusive understanding of entomology, emphasizing the importance of cultural narratives and community engagement in ecological research.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Entomology represents a paradigm shift in ecological research. Traditional knowledge systems, often rooted in indigenous practices, emphasize a holistic understanding of nature, sustainability, and biodiversity stewardship. Entomology, the scientific study of insects, has traditionally focused on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and pest management. This dissertation will investigate how these two domains can inform and enhance one another.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for several reasons:
1. It highlights the importance of cultural practices in biodiversity conservation.
2. It proposes a new framework for community-driven insect management.
3. It addresses the urgent need for innovative solutions to declining insect populations.
4. It fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists and indigenous communities.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Ecological Knowledge inform modern entomological practices?
2. What are the cultural significances of insects in indigenous communities, and how can these be integrated into conservation strategies?
3. How can community engagement enhance biodiversity monitoring and insect conservation efforts?
