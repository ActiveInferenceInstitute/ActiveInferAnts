# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Prediction Matter Expertise

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing into prediction matter expertise (PME). By fusing subjective experience, cultural context, and holistic understanding with empirical data analysis, this research seeks to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making processes across various fields. The significance of this work lies in its ability to bridge the gap between empirical and non-empirical knowledge, fostering a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to understanding complex systems. The potential impact of this dissertation extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal engagement.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of non-science ways of knowing into PME represents a paradigm shift in how predictions are made and understood. Non-science epistemologies emphasize subjective experiences, cultural narratives, and holistic systems thinking, challenging the dominance of purely empirical approaches.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, offering a fresh perspective on PME by incorporating insights from non-scientific domains. It underscores the importance of emotional intelligence, narrative techniques, and cultural context in enhancing predictive capabilities.
