# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Buckminster Fuller’s Principles Applied to Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s principles with contemporary game design. By integrating concepts such as holistic thinking, ephemeralization, and synergetics, this research aims to revolutionize the field of game design, enhancing player engagement while promoting sustainability and social responsibility. The potential impact of this work extends beyond gaming, influencing educational practices, industry standards, and societal engagement with global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s principles and game design presents a novel domain that emphasizes interconnectedness, sustainability, and emergent gameplay. Fuller’s holistic approach to problem-solving is mirrored in the complexities of game design, where player experiences are shaped by multiple interacting systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two distinct fields, providing a fresh perspective on game design that prioritizes sustainability and player agency. The novelty lies in applying Fuller's theoretical constructs to create a framework that fosters innovative game mechanics, narrative structures, and development practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller’s principles be systematically integrated into game design?
2. What impact do these principles have on player engagement and satisfaction?
3. How can sustainable practices in game development enhance brand loyalty and community engagement?
