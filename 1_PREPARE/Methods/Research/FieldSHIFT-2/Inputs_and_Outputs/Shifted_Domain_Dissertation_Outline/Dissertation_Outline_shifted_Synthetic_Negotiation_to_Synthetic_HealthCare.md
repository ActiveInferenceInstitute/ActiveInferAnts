# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of negotiation principles into the health care sector, proposing a paradigm shift that emphasizes collaborative decision-making between patients and providers. By examining the core tenets of negotiation and their applicability in health care, this research aims to enhance patient satisfaction, improve health outcomes, and foster a more equitable health care environment. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also provide practical frameworks for implementation in clinical settings, ultimately transforming patient-provider interactions.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a critical skill in business, law, and international relations, is increasingly recognized for its potential in health care. This dissertation posits that the principles of negotiation can enhance communication, understanding, and collaboration in patient-provider relationships, addressing existing challenges in health care delivery.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two distinct fields—negotiation and health care—creating a new interdisciplinary domain. The novelty lies in applying negotiation frameworks to health care interactions, thereby redefining patient engagement and care delivery.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles be effectively integrated into patient-provider interactions?
2. What impact does negotiation training for healthcare providers have on patient outcomes?
3. How does cultural competence in negotiation influence patient satisfaction and adherence to treatment plans?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Negotiation:** Evolution from transactional exchanges to complex dialogues in various fields.
- **Health Care:** Transition from paternalism to patient-centered care, emphasizing autonomy and engagement.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Negotiation:** Emphasis on strategies, tactics, and emotional intelligence.
- **Health Care:** Focus on communication barriers, patient dissatisfaction, and care fragmentation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of research on the application of negotiation strategies in health care settings.
- Opportunities to enhance patient engagement and satisfaction through collaborative practices.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Negotiation Theory:** Integrative vs. distributive approaches, BATNA, and cultural awareness.
- **Patient-Centered Care Theory:** Emphasis on empathy, communication, and shared decision-making.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Concepts of **Patient-Provider Negotiation (PPN)** and **Healthcare BATNA** will emerge from the fusion of these domains.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model will be developed to illustrate the dynamic interactions between negotiation strategies and health care practices, emphasizing the importance of emotional management and cultural sensitivity.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative and qualitative research to explore the impact of negotiation training on patient-provider interactions.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and adherence.
- Interviews and focus groups with healthcare providers to gather insights on negotiation practices.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between negotiation training and patient outcomes.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data to uncover common themes in provider experiences.

### Ethical Considerations
Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and ethical guidelines will be followed to ensure confidentiality and respect for patient autonomy.
