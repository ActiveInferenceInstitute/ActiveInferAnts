# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation principles and healthcare practices, proposing a transformative model that redefines patient-provider interactions. By integrating negotiation strategies into healthcare, the research seeks to enhance patient engagement, satisfaction, and overall outcomes. The significance of this work lies in its potential to address prevalent challenges in healthcare, such as fragmented care and patient dissatisfaction, by fostering collaborative decision-making. The proposed research is expected to generate impactful insights, leading to the development of new frameworks, training programs, and technological innovations that will benefit both patients and healthcare providers.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of negotiation and healthcare represents a groundbreaking shift in how care is delivered and experienced. Traditionally, negotiation has been confined to business and interpersonal interactions, focusing on reaching mutually beneficial agreements. In healthcare, however, the emphasis has often been on provider-dominated decision-making, leaving patients feeling marginalized. This dissertation will explore how negotiation principles can be effectively transposed into healthcare settings.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of patient-provider interactions by proposing a negotiation framework that emphasizes shared decision-making. The novelty lies in the application of negotiation strategies—such as active listening, empathy, and cultural awareness—within healthcare contexts, which have not been systematically explored in existing literature.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can negotiation principles enhance patient-provider interactions in healthcare?
2. What are the impacts of structured negotiation processes on patient satisfaction and treatment adherence?
3. How can healthcare providers be trained in negotiation skills to improve care delivery?
4. What technological innovations can support negotiation in healthcare settings?
