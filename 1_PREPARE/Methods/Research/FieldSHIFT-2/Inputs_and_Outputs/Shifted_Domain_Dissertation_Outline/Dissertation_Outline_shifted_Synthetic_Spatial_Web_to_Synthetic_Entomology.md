# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Entomology through the Lens of the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Entomology and the Spatial Web, proposing a transformative framework for understanding and managing insect populations. By integrating advanced technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twins, this research aims to address critical challenges in entomology, including declining insect populations, pesticide resistance, and climate change impacts. The findings are expected to significantly enhance public engagement, improve pest management strategies, and foster interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to biodiversity conservation and sustainable agricultural practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web represents a paradigm shift, merging physical and digital environments to create interactive and intelligent systems. In contrast, entomology, the study of insects, faces numerous challenges that threaten ecosystems and biodiversity. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, leveraging the capabilities of the Spatial Web to revolutionize entomological research and practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses pressing global issues through an interdisciplinary lens. By applying Spatial Web technologies to entomology, the study offers novel approaches for data integration, real-time monitoring, and public engagement, creating opportunities for innovative solutions to longstanding challenges in insect conservation and management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Spatial Web technologies enhance the understanding and management of insect populations?
2. What new educational paradigms can be developed through the integration of AR and VR in entomology?
3. How can real-time monitoring systems improve pest management strategies and contribute to ecological sustainability?
4. What collaborative frameworks can be established to facilitate interdisciplinary research in this Shifted Domain?
