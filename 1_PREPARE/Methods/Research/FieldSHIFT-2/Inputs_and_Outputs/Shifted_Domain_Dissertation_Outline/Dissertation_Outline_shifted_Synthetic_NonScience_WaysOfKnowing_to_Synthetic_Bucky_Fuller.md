# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Framework of Buckminster Fuller

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing with Buckminster Fuller’s design principles to create a more holistic approach to sustainability and design. By examining subjective experiences, cultural contexts, and holistic methodologies, this research seeks to redefine traditional paradigms and generate innovative solutions that resonate with diverse communities. The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge gaps between scientific rigor and cultural narratives, fostering a more inclusive and effective framework for addressing global challenges. The anticipated impact extends to education, policy-making, and sustainable practices, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and sustainable future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative fusion of non-science ways of knowing and Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy. Non-science methodologies emphasize subjective experience and cultural narratives, while Fuller’s work is rooted in systems thinking and sustainable design. This dissertation will explore how these two domains can inform and enhance each other, creating a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing complex global issues.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of non-science ways of knowing into Fuller’s framework is a novel approach that challenges traditional scientific paradigms. This research is significant as it highlights the importance of cultural context and subjective experience in sustainability and design, providing a counterbalance to empirical data. By doing so, it opens up new avenues for research and practice that respect and incorporate diverse perspectives.
