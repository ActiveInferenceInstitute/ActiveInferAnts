# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing RSA Cryptography into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of RSA cryptography and non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework that integrates mathematical principles with cultural narratives. By examining the underlying structures of both domains, this research aims to develop a new theoretical model that enhances our understanding of knowledge creation and validation in diverse contexts. The potential impact of this work extends to education, technology, and community engagement, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to address complex global challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of RSA cryptography—a cornerstone of modern security—and non-science ways of knowing, which encompass intuitive, cultural, and experiential forms of understanding. This integration allows for a re-evaluation of how knowledge is constructed, validated, and shared across different contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems, proposing that both can coexist and enhance one another. The novelty lies in applying cryptographic principles to cultural narratives, thereby offering a fresh perspective on knowledge validation and meaning-making.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of RSA cryptography inform non-scientific ways of knowing?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this integration?
3. In what ways can this framework be applied to enhance community engagement and cultural sensitivity in research?
