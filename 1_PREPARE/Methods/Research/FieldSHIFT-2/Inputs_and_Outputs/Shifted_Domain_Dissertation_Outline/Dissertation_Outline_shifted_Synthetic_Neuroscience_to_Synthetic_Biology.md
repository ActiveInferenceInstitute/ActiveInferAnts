## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of neural network concepts with ecosystem dynamics represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding complex systems. Neural networks, both biological and artificial, are characterized by their interconnectedness and adaptability. Similarly, ecosystems consist of interdependent species that interact with their environment. This dissertation will explore these parallels, revealing insights into how ecosystems can be conceptualized as dynamic networks capable of learning and adapting to disturbances.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
