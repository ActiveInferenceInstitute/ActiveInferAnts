# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience Concepts to Ecology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of neuroscience and ecology, proposing a novel framework that positions ecological systems as dynamic networks analogous to neural networks. By drawing parallels between neural processes and ecological interactions, this research seeks to uncover new insights into ecosystem resilience, species interactions, and biodiversity. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize ecological research methodologies, conservation strategies, and educational practices, ultimately fostering a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of biological systems.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Neuroscience and ecology, traditionally viewed as distinct fields, share fundamental principles regarding network dynamics, adaptability, and communication. This dissertation examines how concepts from neuroscience can be transposed into ecology to enhance our understanding of ecological systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two fields that have rarely intersected, offering new perspectives on ecological resilience and adaptability. The novelty lies in the introduction of concepts such as "ecological plasticity" and "trophic oscillations," which provide fresh insights into species interactions and ecosystem dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of neural networks inform our understanding of ecological networks?
2. In what ways do concepts of synaptic plasticity and ecological resilience overlap?
3. What are the implications of viewing ecological interactions through the lens of neurotransmission?
