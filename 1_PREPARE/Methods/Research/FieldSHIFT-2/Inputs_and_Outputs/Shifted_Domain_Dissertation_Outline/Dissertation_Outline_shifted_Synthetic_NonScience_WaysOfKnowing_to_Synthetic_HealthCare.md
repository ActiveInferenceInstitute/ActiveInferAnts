# Executive Summary

This dissertation plan outlines a groundbreaking exploration into the integration of non-science ways of knowing into healthcare, proposing a transformative framework that challenges conventional medical paradigms. By examining the interplay between holistic understanding, cultural narratives, and emotional intelligence, the research aims to develop innovative health models that prioritize patient experience and community engagement. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance healthcare outcomes, foster empathy among providers, and promote health equity. Ultimately, this dissertation seeks to establish a new interdisciplinary field that bridges health, culture, and the arts, paving the way for a more inclusive and effective healthcare system.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of non-science ways of knowing—such as indigenous knowledge systems, artistic expression, and philosophical reasoning—with the traditional paradigms of healthcare. This integration acknowledges the limitations of empirical evidence alone in addressing the complexities of human health and illness. By valuing subjective experiences and cultural contexts, this domain shift aims to create a more holistic understanding of health.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which challenges the dominant biomedical model by advocating for the inclusion of non-scientific knowledge systems. This research has the potential to revolutionize healthcare practices, enhance patient-provider relationships, and improve health outcomes, particularly for marginalized populations.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing be effectively integrated into healthcare practices?
2. What are the impacts of culturally-informed care on patient outcomes and satisfaction?
3. How can artistic expression and narrative medicine enhance emotional resilience in patients?
4. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the fusion of these two domains?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Lack of empirical research on the integration of non-science ways of knowing in clinical settings.
- Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration to address complex health issues.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Holistic Health Theory**: Emphasizes the interconnectedness of physical, emotional, and social health.
- **Cultural Competency Theory**: Focuses on the ability of healthcare providers to understand and respect diverse cultural backgrounds.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Integrative Health Model**: A framework that combines scientific and non-scientific approaches to health.
- **Narrative Engagement Theory**: Explores the role of storytelling in shaping health behaviors and experiences.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

- A comprehensive model that incorporates holistic health, cultural competency, and narrative engagement, providing a roadmap for practice and research.
