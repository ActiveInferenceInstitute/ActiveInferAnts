# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into the Context of Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and mitochondrial biology, presenting a transformative perspective on cellular health and sustainability. By integrating principles of sustainability, cultural narratives, adaptive resilience, and interconnectedness from TK into the framework of mitochondrial function, this research seeks to develop new hypotheses, models, and practical applications that bridge these two distinct domains. The anticipated impact includes advancing scientific understanding, informing health interventions, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations that honor both empirical science and cultural wisdom.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Traditional Knowledge and mitochondrial biology represents a novel approach to understanding cellular health. Traditional Knowledge encompasses holistic, sustainable practices rooted in cultural contexts, while mitochondrial biology focuses on cellular energy dynamics and metabolic regulation. This dissertation will explore how these domains can inform and enhance each other.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional paradigms in both fields, proposing that traditional ecological practices can provide insights into mitochondrial function and health. The novelty lies in the development of a new lexicon and theoretical frameworks that facilitate a deeper understanding of cellular processes through the lens of traditional ecological wisdom.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of Traditional Knowledge inform our understanding of mitochondrial health and function?
2. What new models can be developed from the integration of TK and mitochondrial biology?
3. How can this interdisciplinary approach lead to practical applications in health and disease management?
