# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Traditional Knowledge in the Context of Mitochondrial Biology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Mitochondrial Biology, a Shifted Domain that offers profound insights into health, sustainability, and resilience. By integrating the holistic, sustainable practices of TK with the scientific principles of mitochondrial function, this research aims to develop a comprehensive framework that enhances our understanding of cellular health while respecting cultural heritage. The potential impact of this work extends to interdisciplinary collaborations, educational reforms, and practical applications in public health and environmental sustainability.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of Traditional Knowledge and Mitochondrial Biology represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding health and ecology. TK, rooted in centuries of indigenous wisdom, emphasizes the interconnectedness of life, sustainability, and resilience, while mitochondrial biology focuses on cellular energy production and health. This dissertation seeks to systematically explore the synergies between these fields.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges conventional scientific paradigms by integrating indigenous knowledge systems into modern biology. The novelty lies in the potential to create a holistic model of mitochondrial health that incorporates cultural, environmental, and biological perspectives, thereby promoting sustainable practices and community well-being.
