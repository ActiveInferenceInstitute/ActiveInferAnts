# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle into the Study of Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and the behavior of Hymenopteraâ€”ants, bees, and wasps. By applying the FEP framework to these insects, the research seeks to uncover new insights into their collective intelligence, communication strategies, and ecological roles. The findings are expected to advance theoretical understanding in both fields, leading to practical applications in technology and ecology. This research not only deepens our comprehension of Hymenoptera but also contributes to broader interdisciplinary dialogues, fostering new avenues for research and innovation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize variational free energy, a concept that has traditionally been applied to individual organisms. Hymenoptera, known for their complex social structures and behaviors, present an opportunity to explore how these principles manifest at the collective level within adaptive systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it bridges cognitive science and entomology, providing a novel framework for understanding the behaviors of social insects. By reinterpreting Hymenoptera through the lens of the FEP, the dissertation aims to reveal underlying mechanisms of collective decision-making, communication, and ecological adaptation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the behaviors of Hymenoptera be modeled as systems minimizing free energy?
2. What are the implications of collective decision-making processes in these insects for understanding adaptive systems?
3. In what ways can insights from this research inform technological innovations and ecological strategies?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Free Energy Principle**: Originating in cognitive science and theoretical biology, the FEP has primarily focused on individual organisms and their predictive capabilities.
- **Hymenoptera Behavior**: Historically studied in isolation, Hymenoptera have been examined for their social structures, communication methods, and ecological impacts.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Recent advancements in FEP have begun to explore collective dynamics, yet its application to social insects remains underexplored.
- Hymenoptera research has focused on individual species behaviors, lacking integration with theoretical frameworks from cognitive science.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- The intersection of FEP and Hymenoptera offers a unique opportunity to fill gaps in understanding collective behavior and adaptive systems.
- There is a need for interdisciplinary research that combines insights from both domains to foster innovation.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Active Inference**: The process through which organisms predict and adapt to their environments.
- **Collective Intelligence**: The ability of groups to solve problems and make decisions collectively.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Colony Free Energy**: A collective measure of surprise experienced by a colony.
- **Pheromone Predictions**: Anticipated chemical signals guiding social interactions.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
The dissertation proposes an integrated model that combines the principles of the FEP with the social dynamics of Hymenoptera, framing their behaviors as adaptive strategies aimed at minimizing collective free energy.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative observational studies with quantitative modeling.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Field Studies**: Observations of foraging behavior and communication in natural settings.
- **Experimental Manipulations**: Controlled experiments to test hypotheses related to decision-making and communication.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Modeling**: Use of regression analysis to identify relationships between behaviors and environmental variables.
- **Simulation Models**: Development of computational models to simulate collective decision-making processes.

### Ethical Considerations
All research will adhere to ethical guidelines for the treatment of living organisms, ensuring minimal disruption to natural behaviors and habitats.
