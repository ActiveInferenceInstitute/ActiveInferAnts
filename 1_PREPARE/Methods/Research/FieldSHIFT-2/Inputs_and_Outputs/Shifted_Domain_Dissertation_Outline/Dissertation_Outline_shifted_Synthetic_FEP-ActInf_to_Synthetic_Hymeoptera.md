# PhD Dissertation Plan: The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Applied to Hymenoptera

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of applying the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) to the study of Hymenoptera, specifically ants and bees. By integrating concepts from cognitive science and entomology, this research will illuminate the adaptive mechanisms of these social insects and their implications for broader ecological and cognitive theories. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to the understanding of collective intelligence, predictive modeling, and resource management in complex systems, thereby offering innovative solutions to real-world challenges.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle posits that living systems actively minimize surprise by continuously updating their internal models of the world. Hymenoptera, with their complex social structures and behaviors, provide a unique opportunity to apply these concepts, revealing insights into both individual and collective behavior.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is novel in its interdisciplinary approach, merging cognitive science with entomology. The implications of this shift extend beyond academia, offering potential applications in robotics, agriculture, and ecological management.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the concepts of predictive coding and active inference be applied to the understanding of Hymenoptera behavior?
2. What insights can be gained from the architectural and social structures of ant colonies when viewed through the lens of the Free Energy Principle?
3. How does the application of these theories inform our understanding of collective intelligence and decision-making in social insects?
