# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle into Neural Networks

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from theoretical neuroscience with the architecture and learning mechanisms of neural networks in artificial intelligence. By establishing a systematic transposition of concepts from FEP into neural networks, this research will illuminate novel pathways for enhancing machine learning algorithms, fostering adaptive learning systems, and creating a new lexicon that bridges both domains. The potential impact of this work extends to both theoretical advancements and practical applications in AI, robotics, and cognitive science, positioning the candidate as a pioneer in this emergent interdisciplinary field.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle provides a framework for understanding how biological systems maintain their states through the minimization of free energy. In contrast, neural networks, particularly in artificial intelligence, focus on optimizing signal processing and learning through data-driven approaches. The fusion of these two domains presents an unprecedented opportunity to enhance our understanding of intelligence, both biological and artificial.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
