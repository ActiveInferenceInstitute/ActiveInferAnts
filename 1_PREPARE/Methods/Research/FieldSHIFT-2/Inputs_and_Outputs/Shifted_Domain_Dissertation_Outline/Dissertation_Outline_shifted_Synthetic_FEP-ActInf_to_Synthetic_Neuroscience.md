# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference into Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a comprehensive exploration of the integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference into the field of neuroscience. By framing neural processes as systems that strive to minimize variational free energy, this research aims to uncover novel insights into cognitive functions, learning mechanisms, and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of brain function, inform therapeutic approaches, and inspire advancements in artificial intelligence. The dissertation will serve as a foundational text for future research and education, establishing a new interdisciplinary paradigm.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems, including the brain, minimize surprise or prediction error to maintain homeostasis. Active Inference extends this principle, suggesting that organisms not only predict sensory inputs but also act to confirm these predictions. Neuroscience, with its focus on the structure and function of the nervous system, provides a rich backdrop for applying these principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its attempt to synthesize concepts from thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and neuroscience, creating a unified framework that enhances our understanding of cognitive processes. The implications of this integration are profound, offering new avenues for research in neuroplasticity, decision-making, and mental health.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the Free Energy Principle be quantitatively applied to neural processes?
- In what ways does Active Inference inform our understanding of learning and decision-making in the brain?
- What are the implications of this integration for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamic theories and has evolved to encompass cognitive neuroscience. Neuroscience has historically focused on neural mechanisms without a unifying theoretical framework.
