# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating exercise as a foundational component of healthcare, creating a Shifted Domain that redefines traditional healthcare paradigms. By synthesizing principles from exercise science and healthcare, this research seeks to establish a comprehensive framework for exercise prescriptions, enhance patient engagement, and improve health outcomes. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize patient care, reduce chronic disease prevalence, and foster a culture of preventive health. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also have practical implications for healthcare policy and practice.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The integration of exercise into healthcare represents a paradigm shift from a disease-centric approach to a holistic model that emphasizes prevention and wellness. This shift acknowledges the multifaceted benefits of physical activity, recognizing its role in improving both physical and mental health outcomes. 

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses the gap in current healthcare practices that often overlook exercise as a critical component of patient care. By establishing exercise as a therapeutic intervention, this study proposes a novel approach to chronic disease management and mental health treatment, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can exercise be effectively integrated into standard healthcare practices?
2. What are the measurable impacts of exercise prescriptions on chronic disease management?
3. How does the incorporation of exercise influence patient engagement and satisfaction?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Domain A: Exercise
- Evolution of exercise from a focus on athletic performance to a recognized therapeutic intervention.
- Development of exercise physiology and its implications for health.

### Domain B: Healthcare
- Traditional healthcare model focused on disease treatment rather than prevention.
- Emergence of patient-centered care and its implications for holistic health.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

- The growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of exercise in managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions.
- Increasing recognition of the importance of lifestyle factors in healthcare.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- Insufficient integration of exercise into healthcare protocols.
- Lack of standardized exercise prescriptions in treatment plans.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- Biopsychosocial model in healthcare.
- Theories of behavior change related to exercise adherence.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- Exercise as a therapeutic intervention (ExRx).
- Holistic patient engagement (HPE) model.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model that combines exercise science principles with healthcare practices to enhance patient care and outcomes.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research to assess the impact of exercise integration into healthcare.

## Data Collection Methods

- Surveys and questionnaires to gather patient feedback on exercise prescriptions.
- Clinical trials to measure health outcomes associated with exercise integration.

## Analytical Approaches

- Statistical analysis of health outcomes (e.g., reduction in chronic disease symptoms).
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data from patient interviews.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and the well-being of participants throughout the research process.
