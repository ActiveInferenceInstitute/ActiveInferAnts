# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Neuroscience to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By leveraging insights from neuroscience, the research will propose a framework for enhancing guest interactions, emotional engagement, and service recovery strategies. The potential impact of this work includes improved guest satisfaction, loyalty, and operational efficiency in hospitality, ultimately revolutionizing how businesses understand and serve their customers.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and operational efficiency. However, the integration of neuroscience offers a new lens through which to understand guest behavior and preferences. This dissertation will explore how neural mechanisms influence human interactions and decision-making processes in the context of guest experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it represents a pioneering approach to enhancing guest experiences through the application of neuroscience principles. By bridging two distinct fields, the study will fill existing gaps in hospitality research and provide actionable insights for industry practitioners.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from neuroscience be applied to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What are the implications of emotional engagement on guest satisfaction and loyalty?
3. How can hospitality businesses adapt their service recovery strategies based on neuroscience insights?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Neuroscience:** Overview of its evolution from anatomical studies to advanced imaging techniques.
- **Guest Experience:** Historical development of hospitality management and its focus on customer service.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Neuroscience:** Recent trends in emotional neuroscience, neuroeconomics, and their implications for behavior.
- **Guest Experience:** Current paradigms in hospitality, including personalization, service quality, and technology integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience with hospitality.
- Opportunities to enhance personalization and emotional connection in guest experiences.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Neuroscience Theories:** Neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and neurotransmitter functions.
- **Guest Experience Theories:** Service quality models, customer satisfaction theories, and emotional engagement frameworks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Emotional Resonance Theory:** The impact of emotional engagement on guest satisfaction.
- **Service Plasticity Model:** Adaptive service recovery strategies informed by neuroscience.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines neuroscience principles with guest experience frameworks to enhance service delivery and guest interactions.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, incorporating qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of neuroscience and guest experience.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and questionnaires to assess guest satisfaction and emotional engagement.
- Interviews with hospitality professionals to understand current practices and challenges.
- Experimental studies to test hypotheses related to service recovery and emotional resonance.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data to identify correlations between emotional engagement and guest satisfaction.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews to extract insights on service recovery strategies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent from participants, maintaining confidentiality, and adhering to ethical guidelines in research involving human subjects.
