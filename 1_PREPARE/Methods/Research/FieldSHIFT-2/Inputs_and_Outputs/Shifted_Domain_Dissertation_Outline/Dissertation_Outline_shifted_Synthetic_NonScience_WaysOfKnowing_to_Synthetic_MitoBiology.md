# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Context of Mitochondria

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing into mitochondrial research. By bridging the gap between empirical science and holistic, culturally-informed perspectives, this work seeks to redefine how we understand mitochondrial function and dysfunction. The research will provide a comprehensive framework for incorporating indigenous knowledge, artistic expression, and narrative techniques into mitochondrial biology, ultimately fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative solutions to health challenges.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of non-science ways of knowing with mitochondrial research represents a groundbreaking approach to understanding cellular processes. Non-science knowledge systems, including indigenous wisdom, artistic insights, and philosophical reasoning, offer holistic perspectives that can complement traditional scientific methodologies. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant in its potential to redefine mitochondrial biology by integrating diverse epistemologies. It challenges the prevailing scientific paradigm that often marginalizes non-scientific knowledge, advocating for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the value of different ways of knowing.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-scientific ways of knowing enhance our understanding of mitochondrial function and dysfunction?
- What frameworks can be developed to integrate these perspectives into mitochondrial research?
- What are the implications of this integration for education, public health, and interdisciplinary collaboration?

## Literature Review
