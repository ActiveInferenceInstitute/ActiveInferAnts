# Dissertation Plan: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative synthesis of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and negotiation, presenting a novel framework that leverages data-driven insights to enhance negotiation outcomes. By integrating methodologies from both fields, this research aims to establish predictive negotiation as a distinct approach, fostering improved decision-making, cultural adaptability, and emotional intelligence in negotiations. The potential impact of this research extends to various domains, including corporate negotiations, international diplomacy, and conflict resolution, ultimately contributing to more equitable and effective agreements.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) and negotiation represents a transformative shift in how negotiations are approached. PME emphasizes the synthesis of knowledge from diverse fields and the utilization of data analytics for informed decision-making. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a relational process, can benefit significantly from these predictive insights.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a data-driven paradigm to negotiation, addressing existing gaps in predictive frameworks within the field. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of PME elements into negotiation strategies, offering a comprehensive model that enhances negotiation efficacy and adaptability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can predictive analytics be integrated into negotiation strategies to improve outcomes?
- What are the implications of cross-disciplinary insights on negotiation practices?
- How can emotional intelligence be enhanced through predictive modeling in negotiation?
