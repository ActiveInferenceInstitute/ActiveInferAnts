# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into the field of negotiation, aiming to create a transformative framework that enhances negotiation strategies through predictive analytics, interdisciplinary insights, and continuous learning. The research seeks to redefine negotiation practices by proposing a structured approach that leverages data-driven predictions and diverse disciplinary knowledge. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering practical applications in industry, policy, and societal contexts.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of PME and negotiation represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines analytical rigor with intuitive decision-making. PME emphasizes the importance of synthesizing knowledge across various fields to make informed predictions, while negotiation traditionally focuses on dialogue and mutual agreement. This dissertation aims to bridge these domains, creating a new paradigm for negotiation that incorporates predictive modeling and cross-disciplinary strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of traditional negotiation frameworks, which often overlook the potential of data-driven insights and interdisciplinary collaboration. By introducing predictive negotiation strategies, this work aims to enhance the effectiveness of negotiators and provide a systematic approach to integrating diverse perspectives.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can predictive analytics improve negotiation outcomes?
2. What interdisciplinary strategies can be integrated into negotiation practices?
3. How does emotional intelligence influence predictive negotiation success?
4. What are the implications of this integrated approach for future negotiation education and practice?
