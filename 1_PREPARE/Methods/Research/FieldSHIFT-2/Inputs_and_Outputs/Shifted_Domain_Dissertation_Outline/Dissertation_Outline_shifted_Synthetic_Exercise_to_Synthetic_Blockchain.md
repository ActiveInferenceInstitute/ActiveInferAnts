# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating exercise science with blockchain technology, a Shifted Domain that opens new avenues for research, applications, and societal impact. By leveraging principles of exercise—such as progressive overload, specificity, recovery, and variety—this study proposes innovative blockchain solutions that enhance health outcomes and promote physical activity. The research aims to develop a theoretical framework, empirical methodologies, and practical applications that not only address existing challenges in both fields but also establish a foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration. The potential impact extends to public health, fitness technology, and health policy, positioning this work at the forefront of emerging trends in health and technology.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of exercise science and blockchain technology represents a novel interdisciplinary field that seeks to harness the strengths of both domains. Exercise science focuses on the physiological, psychological, and social aspects of physical activity, while blockchain technology offers decentralized, secure, and transparent systems for data management. This dissertation investigates how the principles of exercise can inform and enhance blockchain applications, creating a synergistic relationship that benefits both individual health and broader societal outcomes.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses critical gaps in both exercise science and blockchain technology. By applying exercise principles to blockchain, we can develop innovative solutions that promote physical activity, enhance data security, and improve health outcomes. The novelty lies in the conceptual framework that merges these two distinct fields, allowing for the exploration of new hypotheses and practical applications that have not been previously considered.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of exercise inform the development of more efficient and user-friendly blockchain systems?
2. In what ways can blockchain technology incentivize physical activity and improve public health outcomes?
3. What are the potential interdisciplinary applications and implications of merging exercise science with blockchain technology?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The study of exercise has evolved from rudimentary physical activity for survival to a sophisticated field focused on health, fitness, and performance optimization. Meanwhile, blockchain technology has emerged from the realm of cryptocurrencies to become a foundational element of decentralized applications across various sectors.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Current research in exercise science emphasizes the physiological and psychological benefits of physical activity, while blockchain research focuses on its decentralized nature, security features, and potential applications in various industries. However, there is limited exploration of how these fields can intersect.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There is a lack of interdisciplinary research that combines exercise science with blockchain technology. This presents a unique opportunity to explore how exercise principles can enhance blockchain applications, create new incentives for physical activity, and develop frameworks for health data management.
