# PhD Dissertation Plan: Exercise to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between the fields of Exercise Science and Negotiation, termed the "Shifted Domain." By analyzing the core principles and methodologies of both fields, the research will identify isomorphisms and propose novel frameworks that integrate physical fitness with negotiation strategies. The potential impact of this research includes enhanced negotiation outcomes, improved cognitive and emotional regulation, and the development of interdisciplinary curricula and training programs. Through rigorous empirical studies, this dissertation will contribute significantly to both academic fields and practical applications in industry and society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges Exercise Science, which focuses on physical activity and its health benefits, with Negotiation, a dialogue aimed at reaching mutually beneficial agreements. This fusion offers unique insights into how physical preparedness can enhance negotiation effectiveness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its ability to challenge traditional paradigms of negotiation by introducing physical fitness as a critical component. This novel perspective has the potential to revolutionize negotiation training and practices, promoting a holistic approach to skill development.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of exercise be effectively integrated into negotiation training?
2. What are the measurable impacts of physical fitness on negotiation outcomes?
3. How can new pedagogical approaches enhance the learning experience in negotiation?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Exercise:** Overview of the evolution of exercise as a structured field, from physical labor to fitness and rehabilitation.
- **Negotiation:** Examination of the historical development of negotiation theories and practices.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Exercise:** Insights into the latest trends in personalized fitness, technology integration, and mental health benefits.
- **Negotiation:** Analysis of current challenges, including power dynamics, cultural differences, and emotional management.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary research that connects physical preparedness with negotiation effectiveness presents a unique opportunity for exploration.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Exercise Science Theories:** Progressive overload, specificity, recovery, and variability.
- **Negotiation Theories:** Interest-based negotiation, integrative bargaining, and the role of emotions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
Proposing a new theoretical construct that integrates physical fitness principles into negotiation strategies.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A model that illustrates the interaction between physical conditioning, cognitive function, and negotiation outcomes.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative research methods to explore the integration of exercise into negotiation training.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and questionnaires to gather data on negotiation outcomes.
- Experimental studies comparing traditional training versus exercise-integrated training.

### Analytical Approaches
Statistical analysis to measure the impact of physical fitness on negotiation performance, alongside qualitative analysis of participant feedback.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring participant confidentiality, informed consent, and the right to withdraw from the study at any time.
