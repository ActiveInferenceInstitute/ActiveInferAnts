# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel fusion of two distinct fields: the artistic and philosophical legacy of William Blake and the practical, technology-driven world of ATM transactions. Blake's work, characterized by its imaginative and visionary qualities, stands in contrast to the often utilitarian and security-focused nature of ATM design. This dissertation seeks to bridge the gap between these domains, proposing a reimagined approach to banking technology that embraces creativity and user experience.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it challenges the traditional paradigms of ATM design, which prioritize efficiency and security at the expense of user engagement. Secondly, it offers a fresh perspective on the application of artistic principles within technology, suggesting that integrating creativity into functional design can enhance user satisfaction and accessibility. This interdisciplinary approach not only contributes to the fields of art and technology but also has the potential to influence broader discussions on financial inclusion and user-centered design.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of William Blake's artistic vision be applied to enhance the design and functionality of ATMs?
2. What impact does the integration of artistic elements into ATM interfaces have on user satisfaction and engagement?
3. In what ways can a dual-interface system improve accessibility and transaction success rates for diverse user demographics?
4. What are the implications of this Shifted Domain for future research, industry practices, and educational approaches in banking technology?
