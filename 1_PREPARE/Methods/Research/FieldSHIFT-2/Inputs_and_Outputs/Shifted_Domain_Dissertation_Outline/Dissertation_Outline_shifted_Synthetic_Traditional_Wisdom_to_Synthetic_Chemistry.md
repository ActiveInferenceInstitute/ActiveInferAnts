# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge into Chemical Reactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the integration of Traditional Knowledge (TK) into the field of Chemical Reactions, creating a Shifted Domain that emphasizes sustainability, community involvement, and holistic approaches to chemical processes. By transposing core principles of TK into modern chemistry, this research seeks to develop innovative methodologies for sustainable chemical practices, thereby addressing environmental challenges and enhancing community engagement. The findings will have significant implications for both chemical research and traditional knowledge systems, fostering a new paradigm that respects cultural wisdom while advancing scientific inquiry.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The integration of Traditional Knowledge into Chemical Reactions represents an innovative intersection of indigenous wisdom and modern scientific practices. Traditional Knowledge encompasses a holistic understanding of ecological systems, sustainability, and community engagement, which can be leveraged to address contemporary challenges in chemical processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the reductionist paradigms of modern chemistry by proposing a framework that incorporates ecological and cultural dimensions. The novelty lies in creating a new theoretical model that merges TK with chemical methodologies, offering a fresh perspective on sustainability in chemical reactions.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Traditional Knowledge inform sustainable practices in chemical reactions?
2. What are the potential benefits of community involvement in chemical research?
3. How can a holistic approach to chemical processes enhance sustainability and cultural relevance?
