# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Traditional Knowledge and Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Chemistry, proposing a transformative framework that integrates indigenous ecological practices with modern chemical science. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize sustainable chemical practices, enhance biodiversity, and respect cultural heritage. By addressing critical gaps in current knowledge and proposing new theoretical constructs, this dissertation will contribute to both academic discourse and practical applications in environmental sustainability, policy-making, and industry practices.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Traditional Knowledge embodies the cumulative wisdom of indigenous and local communities, focusing on sustainability and ecological balance. Chemistry, as a scientific discipline, seeks to understand matter and its transformations but faces challenges related to environmental sustainability and public perception. This dissertation investigates the intersection of these two domains, aiming to create a synergistic approach that leverages the strengths of both.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of TK into chemistry represents a novel approach to addressing contemporary challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. This research will highlight the transformative potential of TK in informing sustainable chemical practices and fostering a more holistic understanding of ecological systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Traditional Knowledge inform sustainable practices in chemistry?
- What new theoretical constructs emerge from the integration of TK and chemistry?
- What are the practical implications of this integration for industry and policy?
