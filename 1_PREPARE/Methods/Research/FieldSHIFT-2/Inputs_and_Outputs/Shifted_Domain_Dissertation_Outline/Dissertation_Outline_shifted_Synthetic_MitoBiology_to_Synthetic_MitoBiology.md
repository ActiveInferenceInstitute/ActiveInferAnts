# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Mitochondrial Biology into Organizational Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and organizational dynamics, proposing a transformative framework that applies biological principles to enhance organizational performance and adaptability. By examining the isomorphisms between these two domains, the research aims to create novel models and strategies for organizations to optimize their energy management, structural dynamics, talent development, and stress mitigation. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, offering practical applications for industry, policy, and societal well-being.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Mitochondrial biology, traditionally focused on cellular functions, provides insights into energy production, dynamics, and stress responses. Organizational dynamics, on the other hand, examines how organizations operate and evolve. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, revealing how biological processes can inform organizational strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of mitochondrial principles into organizational dynamics is novel, offering a unique perspective on enhancing productivity, resilience, and employee engagement. This research has the potential to redefine management practices and contribute to the development of interdisciplinary fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can mitochondrial energy production concepts be applied to organizational performance?
2. What organizational structures best mirror mitochondrial dynamics to promote adaptability?
3. How can talent development initiatives be modeled after mitochondrial biogenesis to enhance workforce capabilities?
4. In what ways can stress management protocols be informed by the concept of reactive oxygen species in organizations?
