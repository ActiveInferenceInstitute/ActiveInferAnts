# PhD Dissertation Plan: Mitochondria as a Metaphor for Organizational Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of applying biological principles—specifically those related to mitochondria—to the field of organizational dynamics. By establishing isomorphisms between cellular processes and organizational behaviors, this research seeks to develop novel frameworks that enhance productivity, adaptability, and employee engagement within organizations. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to both theoretical and practical advancements in management, paving the way for a new interdisciplinary field known as "Organizational Bio-Dynamics."

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between cellular biology and organizational theory, specifically focusing on the principles underlying mitochondrial function and their application to organizational dynamics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally distinct fields, offering fresh insights into organizational efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging biological metaphors, the study provides a new lens through which to understand and improve organizational dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can mitochondrial principles inform organizational structures and processes?
2. What are the implications of viewing organizations as living systems?
3. How can the proposed frameworks enhance adaptability and productivity in organizations?
