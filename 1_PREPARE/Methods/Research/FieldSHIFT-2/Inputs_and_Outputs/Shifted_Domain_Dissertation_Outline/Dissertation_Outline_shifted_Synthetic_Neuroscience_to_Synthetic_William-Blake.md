# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neuroscience into the Life and Work of William Blake

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neuroscience and the life and work of William Blake, unveiling how concepts from neuroscience can illuminate and enrich our understanding of Blake's artistic philosophy. By developing a comprehensive theoretical framework and novel methodologies, this research will address significant gaps in both fields, offering fresh insights into creativity, emotional engagement, and the cognitive processes underlying artistic expression. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing educational practices, artistic appreciation, and interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the empirical rigor of neuroscience with the rich, imaginative world of William Blake, a seminal figure in literature and art. This fusion allows for a nuanced exploration of how cognitive processes influence creative expression and vice versa.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries, proposing a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that bridge neuroscience and art. The novelty lies in applying neuroscientific principles to interpret Blake’s work, revealing deeper connections between human cognition and artistic creation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of neuroscience enhance our understanding of Blake's artistic philosophy?
2. In what ways do cognitive processes manifest in Blake's poetry and visual art?
3. What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for education and artistic appreciation?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of the development of neuroscience from early neuroanatomy to contemporary cognitive neuroscience.
- Examination of the historical and cultural context of William Blake’s life and work, including the Romantic movement and its philosophical underpinnings.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Summary of key findings in neuroscience related to creativity, cognition, and emotional processing.
- Analysis of existing scholarship on Blake’s work, focusing on thematic interpretations and artistic techniques.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary research connecting neuroscience and art.
- Opportunities for novel insights into creativity and emotional engagement through the lens of neuroscience.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Overview of key theories in neuroscience (e.g., neural networks, synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission).
- Summary of Blake’s philosophical beliefs and artistic principles.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Development of integrated constructs such as "Neural Imagery" and "Creative Neurotransmission."
- Exploration of how these constructs can facilitate a deeper understanding of Blake's work.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Presentation of a model that illustrates the interactions between cognitive processes, emotional engagement, and artistic expression.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis of Blake’s works with quantitative neuroscientific research.

### Data Collection Methods
- Textual analysis of Blake’s poetry and visual art.
- Neuroimaging studies (e.g., fMRI) to assess brain activity in response to Blake’s works.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of Blake's texts and images.
- Statistical analysis of neuroimaging data to identify correlations between cognitive engagement and emotional responses.

### Ethical Considerations
- Addressing ethical issues related to human subject research in neuroimaging.
- Ensuring the respectful interpretation of Blake's work in the context of neuroscience.
