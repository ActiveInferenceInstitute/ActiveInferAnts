# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of neural networks and the life and works of William Blake, proposing a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets Blake's themes as interconnected neural elements. By leveraging concepts from neuroscience, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations, this research seeks to uncover deeper insights into Blake's artistic vision and its implications for human consciousness. The potential impact of this work extends beyond literary studies, offering interdisciplinary applications in cognitive science, art education, and digital humanities.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of neural networks and literary analysis represents a groundbreaking shift in understanding creativity and artistic expression. Neural networks, as models of cognition and learning, provide a unique lens through which to examine the complexities of Blake's thematic dualities and their resonance with human experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges the gap between two traditionally distinct fieldsâ€”neuroscience and literature. By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, this dissertation not only offers fresh interpretations of his themes but also contributes to the broader discourse on the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation and appreciation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's themes be modeled as neural networks?
2. In what ways do the dynamics of neural communication enhance our understanding of Blake's artistic expression?
3. What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for the fields of neuroscience, literary studies, and education?
