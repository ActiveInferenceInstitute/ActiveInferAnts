# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Cognitive Security into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive security and the fabric industry, proposing a framework that enhances integrity, transparency, and sustainability. By investigating the implications of misinformation and cognitive biases in textile production and consumption, this research seeks to develop strategies that empower consumers and designers alike. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering practical solutions to industry challenges and contributing to a more ethical fabric landscape.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of cognitive security and the fabric industry represents a novel interdisciplinary approach to addressing misinformation and cognitive biases that affect consumer behavior and industry practices. Cognitive security focuses on protecting cognitive processes from manipulation, while the fabric industry grapples with challenges related to sustainability, quality assurance, and cultural appropriation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two traditionally separate domains, offering a fresh perspective on how cognitive security principles can enhance the fabric industry's integrity. The novelty lies in applying cognitive security frameworks to address real-world issues in textile production and consumption, promoting sustainability and ethical practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cognitive security principles be integrated into the fabric industry to enhance integrity and transparency?
2. What impact does misinformation have on consumer choices regarding fabric sustainability?
3. How can cognitive biases be mitigated in the design and marketing of textiles?
