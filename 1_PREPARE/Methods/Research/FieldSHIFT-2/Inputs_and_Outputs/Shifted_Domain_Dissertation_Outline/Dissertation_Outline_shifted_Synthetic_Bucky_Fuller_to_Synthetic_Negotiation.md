# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s visionary principles and negotiation practices, termed the Shifted Domain. By integrating concepts such as comprehensive anticipatory design science, tensegrity, and synergetics into negotiation frameworks, this research aims to develop novel theories and methodologies that enhance sustainability, collaboration, and resource efficiency in negotiation processes. The potential impact of this work is significant, offering transformative insights for practitioners, educators, and policymakers, and fostering a new paradigm in negotiation that emphasizes long-term relationships and shared goals.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Buckminster Fuller’s holistic design principles and the art of negotiation. Fuller’s work emphasizes sustainability, resource management, and systems thinking, while negotiation focuses on achieving mutually beneficial agreements. This intersection presents an opportunity to reimagine negotiation practices through a lens of sustainability and collaborative problem-solving.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional negotiation paradigms by introducing Fuller’s concepts, which advocate for a more integrated and anticipatory approach. The novelty lies in the systematic application of Fuller's principles to negotiation contexts, potentially leading to innovative negotiation strategies that prioritize long-term sustainability and relational dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Buckminster Fuller’s principles enhance negotiation practices to promote sustainability and collaboration?
2. What new theoretical frameworks can be developed to integrate systems thinking into negotiation?
3. In what ways can the application of these principles lead to more effective and resilient negotiation outcomes?
