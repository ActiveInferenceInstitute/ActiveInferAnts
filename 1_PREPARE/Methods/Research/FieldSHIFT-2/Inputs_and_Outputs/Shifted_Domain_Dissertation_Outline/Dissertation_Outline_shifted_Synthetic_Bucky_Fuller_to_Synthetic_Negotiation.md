# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Principles to the Field of Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes an innovative framework for negotiation by integrating the principles of Buckminster Fuller, a visionary thinker renowned for his holistic and sustainable approaches to global challenges. The research aims to explore how Fuller's concepts—such as Spaceship Earth, ephemeralization, and synergetics—can redefine negotiation strategies to foster sustainable, equitable, and collaborative outcomes. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform traditional negotiation practices, enhancing their effectiveness in addressing complex global issues. The dissertation will contribute to both negotiation theory and practice, offering a robust roadmap for future research and application.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of Buckminster Fuller’s principles and negotiation represents a Shifted Domain that emphasizes sustainability, systems thinking, and collaborative problem-solving. Fuller’s philosophies advocate for a holistic understanding of challenges, which aligns seamlessly with the complexities of modern negotiation contexts.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to merging two distinct domains—sustainable design and negotiation—into a cohesive framework. By leveraging Fuller's insights, the dissertation seeks to create a transformative model for negotiation that prioritizes long-term societal and environmental impacts, thus addressing contemporary challenges in a more integrated manner.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller’s principles be systematically integrated into negotiation practices?
2. What are the anticipated outcomes of applying a sustainable negotiation framework?
3. How do Fuller's concepts enhance the understanding of negotiation dynamics?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Buckminster Fuller:** Exploration of Fuller's philosophies, methodologies, and historical contributions to sustainable design.
- **Negotiation:** Overview of the evolution of negotiation theories, including distributive and integrative approaches.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Sustainable Design:** Current applications of Fuller's principles in architecture, urban planning, and environmental science.
- **Negotiation:** Analysis of contemporary negotiation practices, challenges, and the need for innovative approaches.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary frameworks that incorporate sustainability into negotiation, this section highlights the potential for innovative research that bridges these domains.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Synergetic Dynamics in Negotiation:** Exploring how collaborative approaches yield emergent outcomes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
A visual representation of the proposed model will illustrate the integration of Fuller's principles into negotiation, emphasizing the relationships between sustainability, systems thinking, and negotiation dynamics.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative case studies with quantitative analyses of negotiation outcomes.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Interviews:** Conduct interviews with negotiation practitioners who have applied sustainable practices.
- **Surveys:** Distribute surveys to assess the effectiveness of Fuller's principles in negotiation contexts.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Thematic Analysis:** Analyze qualitative data to identify common themes related to the application of Fuller's principles.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Use statistical methods to evaluate the impact of sustainable negotiation practices on outcomes.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensure informed consent from participants and maintain confidentiality throughout the research process.
