# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the life and work of William Blake into non-science ways of knowing. By examining Blake's unique perspectives on imagination, duality, and artistic expression, the research seeks to develop a comprehensive framework that challenges traditional dichotomies between empirical and experiential knowledge. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize educational practices, foster interdisciplinary collaborations, and promote a more inclusive understanding of knowledge that values diverse perspectives and experiences. The anticipated impact extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, policy-making, and societal engagement.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the rich, imaginative world of William Blake with the diverse methodologies of non-science ways of knowing. This intersection allows for a re-evaluation of how knowledge is constructed, shared, and understood, particularly in contexts that prioritize subjective experience over empirical data.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to bridging the gap between artistic expression and traditional knowledge systems. By applying Blakean principles to non-science ways of knowing, the study aims to create a new paradigm that recognizes the validity of multiple forms of knowledge and their interconnections.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blakean principles of imagination and duality inform non-science ways of knowing?
2. What are the implications of integrating artistic expression into educational curricula and community practices?
3. How can this integration foster emotional intelligence, creativity, and critical thinking in diverse contexts?
