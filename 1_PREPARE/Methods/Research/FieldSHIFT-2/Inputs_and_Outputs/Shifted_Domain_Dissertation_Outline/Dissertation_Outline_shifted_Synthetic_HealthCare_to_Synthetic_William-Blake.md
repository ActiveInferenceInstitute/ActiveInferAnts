# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles to the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between health care principles and the life and work of William Blake, a seminal figure in English literature and art. By examining how concepts such as patient-centered care, holistic approaches, quality of experience, and continuity can be transposed to Blake's artistic and literary practices, this research will uncover new interpretations of his work while simultaneously offering insights into enhancing audience engagement and understanding in the arts. The significance of this study lies in its potential to foster interdisciplinary dialogue, create novel educational frameworks, and provide therapeutic applications of art, thus impacting both the fields of health care and literary studies.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of health care principles with the study of William Blake represents a novel approach to understanding both fields. Health care has evolved significantly to prioritize patient engagement, holistic treatment, and quality care, while Blake's works delve into the complexities of human experience, spirituality, and social critique. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains by examining the parallels in their fundamental principles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only enriches our understanding of Blake's works but also redefines how we engage with art and literature through the lens of health care. The novelty lies in the application of health care methodologies to interpret and experience art, thereby creating a new paradigm for both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can health care principles be applied to the interpretation of William Blake's life and work?
2. What are the implications of this transposition for audience engagement and understanding of art?
3. How can interdisciplinary approaches enhance the study and appreciation of Blake's contributions to literature and art?
