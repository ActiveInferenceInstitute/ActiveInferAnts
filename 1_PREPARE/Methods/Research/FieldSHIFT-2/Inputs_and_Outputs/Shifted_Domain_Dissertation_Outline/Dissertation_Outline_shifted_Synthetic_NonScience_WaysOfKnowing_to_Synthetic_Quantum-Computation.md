# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing—such as intuition, cultural narratives, and experiential learning—into the field of quantum computation. By examining the synergies between these previously distinct domains, this research seeks to develop novel hypotheses, pedagogical approaches, and technological innovations that can enhance both quantum research and education. The findings are expected to have significant implications not only for the advancement of quantum computation but also for interdisciplinary collaboration, societal understanding, and the democratization of knowledge.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The emergence of quantum computation has revolutionized the way information is processed, yet it often operates within a narrow framework dominated by traditional scientific methodologies. Conversely, non-science ways of knowing offer rich, holistic perspectives that have been historically marginalized. This dissertation proposes a paradigm shift that recognizes the value of integrating these diverse epistemologies into quantum research and education.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional boundaries of scientific inquiry, advocating for a more inclusive approach that values intuition, culture, and personal experience alongside empirical data. The novelty lies in its interdisciplinary framework, which not only enhances quantum computation but also promotes a broader understanding of knowledge creation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can non-science ways of knowing inform the development of quantum algorithms?
- In what ways can cultural narratives enhance the communication and education of quantum concepts?
- What pedagogical models can effectively integrate experiential learning into quantum education?
