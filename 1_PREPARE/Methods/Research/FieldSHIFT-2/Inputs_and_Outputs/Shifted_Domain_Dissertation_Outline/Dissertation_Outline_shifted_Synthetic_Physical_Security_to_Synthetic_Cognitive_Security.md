# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of Physical Security and Cognitive Security. Physical Security has historically focused on protecting tangible assets from physical threats, while Cognitive Security addresses the safeguarding of mental processes against misinformation and manipulation. As threats evolve in the digital landscape, the convergence of these two domains offers unprecedented opportunities to develop integrated security strategies.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine security paradigms by applying established principles of Physical Security to the realm of cognitive threats. This novel approach could lead to enhanced public resilience against misinformation and cognitive biases, ultimately fostering a more informed society.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can principles of Physical Security be transposed to enhance Cognitive Security?
2. What are the implications of integrating layered defenses for protecting cognitive processes?
3. How can new theoretical models and practical applications be developed to address the challenges of misinformation?
