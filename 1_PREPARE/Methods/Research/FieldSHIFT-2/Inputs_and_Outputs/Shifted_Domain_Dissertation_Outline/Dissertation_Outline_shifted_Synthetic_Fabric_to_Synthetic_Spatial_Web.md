# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and the Spatial Web, examining how principles of textile design can redefine user experiences in digital environments. By integrating craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural narratives, this research aims to establish a new paradigm in both fields, fostering deeper emotional connections and promoting eco-friendly practices. The findings will contribute to the development of a "Textile-Driven Spatial Experience" model, offering practical applications and theoretical insights that can revolutionize industry standards and educational frameworks.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, with its rich heritage in craftsmanship and design, faces challenges in sustainability and technological integration. Concurrently, the Spatial Web is reshaping user interactions through immersive digital experiences. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, leveraging the strengths of each to create new opportunities for innovation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it combines two traditionally distinct fields, offering novel insights into user engagement, sustainability, and cultural representation. By exploring this Shifted Domain, the dissertation aims to provide a framework that enhances both industries, promoting collaboration and interdisciplinary research.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can textile design principles enhance user engagement in the Spatial Web?
2. What sustainable practices from the fabric industry can be applied to digital experiences?
3. How can cultural narratives be preserved and represented in virtual environments?
