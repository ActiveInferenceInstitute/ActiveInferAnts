# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Spatial Web into the Context of the Free Energy Principle (FEP)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative intersection of the Spatial Web and the Free Energy Principle (FEP), proposing a novel framework for understanding adaptive systems. By integrating the interactive, data-rich nature of the Spatial Web with the predictive processing and active inference mechanisms of the FEP, this research aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical model and empirical strategies that illuminate how organisms can minimize variational free energy through enhanced interaction with their environments. The potential impact of this work spans multiple disciplines, including cognitive science, urban planning, and technology development, offering new insights into decision-making, learning, and adaptive behaviors.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Spatial Web merges digital and physical environments, creating a dynamic landscape where users can interact seamlessly with both realms. In contrast, the Free Energy Principle provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how living systems maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments through predictive coding and active inference. This dissertation aims to bridge these two domains, exploring the implications of their integration for understanding adaptive behaviors.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The convergence of the Spatial Web and FEP represents a significant advancement in our understanding of adaptive systems. By examining how augmented reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and contextual awareness can inform predictive processing, this research addresses critical gaps in both fields, offering a fresh perspective on how organisms navigate and respond to complex environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can augmented reality enhance predictive processing and active inference in adaptive systems?
2. In what ways does spatial data integration influence decision-making and uncertainty reduction?
3. What implications does the integration of the Spatial Web and FEP have for the design of smart environments and urban planning?
