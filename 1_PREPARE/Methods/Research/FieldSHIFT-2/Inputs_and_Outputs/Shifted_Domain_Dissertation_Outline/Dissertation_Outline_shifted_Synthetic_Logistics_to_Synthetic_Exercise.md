## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of logistics and exercise represents a novel approach to understanding and enhancing physical fitness. Logistics, traditionally focused on the efficient movement and management of goods, offers valuable insights into optimizing exercise routines, resource management, and participant engagement. This dissertation seeks to explore the synergies between these two domains and develop a robust framework for their integration.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional paradigms of both logistics and exercise, proposing a comprehensive model that emphasizes efficiency, data-driven decision-making, and collaboration. By adopting a logistics perspective on exercise, this dissertation aims to fill existing gaps in both fields and create a new narrative that enhances health outcomes and promotes sustainable practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into exercise programming to optimize health outcomes?
2. What are the key components of a fitness supply chain, and how can they be managed to enhance adherence and performance?
3. In what ways can data-driven approaches transform traditional exercise models into more effective and personalized programs?
