# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection between negotiation and game design, proposing a transformative framework that integrates negotiation principles into game mechanics. By examining the shared structures and dynamics of both fields, the research aims to enhance player engagement, promote collaboration, and create more immersive narrative experiences. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, influencing game development practices, educational methodologies, and real-world negotiation skills. 

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of negotiation and game design represents a groundbreaking shift in how we understand player interaction and decision-making. Negotiation, traditionally viewed as a dialogue for conflict resolution, shares core elements with game design, which focuses on creating engaging player experiences. This dissertation will delve into the intricacies of both domains to uncover synergies that can lead to innovative game mechanics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine player engagement through the incorporation of negotiation as a core gameplay mechanic. By challenging conventional competitive paradigms in games, this dissertation seeks to elevate the role of dialogue and collaboration, ultimately enriching player experiences. The novelty of this research stems from its interdisciplinary approach, merging theories and practices from negotiation and game design.
