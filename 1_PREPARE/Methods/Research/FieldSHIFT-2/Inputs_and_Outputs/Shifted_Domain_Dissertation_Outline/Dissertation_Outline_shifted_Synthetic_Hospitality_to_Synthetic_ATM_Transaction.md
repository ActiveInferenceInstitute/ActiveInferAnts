# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift: Guest Experience in Hospitality Transposed to ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry with the transactional nature of ATM interactions. It aims to redefine how users engage with ATMs by integrating emotional and personalized experiences that have traditionally been the hallmark of hospitality. The research will not only contribute to the academic discourse on user experience in financial technology but also provide actionable insights for the banking industry. By developing a comprehensive framework that bridges these two domains, the dissertation seeks to enhance user satisfaction, increase transaction frequency, and foster loyalty in a traditionally transactional environment.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on creating memorable guest experiences through personalized service, emotional engagement, and seamless interactions. Conversely, ATM transactions have primarily prioritized efficiency and security, often neglecting the user experience. This dissertation proposes a novel approach that leverages the principles of guest experience to transform ATM interactions into meaningful engagements.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses a critical gap in the ATM industry, where user experience has been largely overlooked. By applying hospitality principles, this dissertation introduces a paradigm shift that could redefine user interactions with ATMs, making them more engaging and satisfying. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of guest experience elements into the ATM context, creating a unique framework for enhancing user satisfaction.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience from the hospitality industry be effectively applied to enhance ATM transactions?
2. What impact does personalization have on user satisfaction and transaction frequency at ATMs?
3. How can technology be integrated to create a more engaging ATM experience?
4. What are the potential societal and industry implications of this shift?
