# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming ATM User Experience through Principles of Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry into the ATM user experience domain. By investigating the synergies between these two fields, the research will establish a framework for enhancing ATM interactions through personalization, service quality, and technology integration. The findings will have significant implications for financial institutions, contributing to improved user satisfaction, increased brand loyalty, and operational efficiency. This research not only fills existing gaps in both fields but also sets the stage for future interdisciplinary studies and applications.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long prioritized guest experience as a key driver of satisfaction and loyalty. Conversely, the ATM user experience has traditionally focused on efficiency and usability, often neglecting the holistic interaction that users have with these machines. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap by applying hospitality principles to enhance the ATM user experience.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to transpose established guest experience frameworks onto the ATM landscape, thereby creating a new paradigm for user interaction in financial services. The significance lies in its potential to revolutionize how users perceive and interact with ATMs, ultimately leading to enhanced satisfaction and engagement.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience from hospitality be effectively integrated into ATM user experience?
2. What impact does personalization have on user satisfaction and transaction efficiency at ATMs?
3. What are the implications of sustainable practices in ATM operations on user perceptions and brand loyalty?
4. How can technology enhance the ATM user experience while addressing privacy concerns?
