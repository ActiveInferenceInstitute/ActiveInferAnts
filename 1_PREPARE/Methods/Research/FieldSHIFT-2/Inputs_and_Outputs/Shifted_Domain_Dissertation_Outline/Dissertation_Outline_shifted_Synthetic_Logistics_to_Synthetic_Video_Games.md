This research is significant for its potential to create a new genre of games that not only entertain but also educate players about logistics principles. By incorporating real-world logistics challenges into game design, we can enhance player engagement and satisfaction while providing valuable insights into supply chain management. The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging gaps between game design and logistics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can logistics principles be effectively integrated into game design to enhance player engagement?
2. What are the potential educational benefits of using game mechanics to teach logistics concepts?
3. How can real-time tracking and resource management systems improve gameplay experiences?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
Logistics has evolved from basic transportation and inventory management to a complex field encompassing global supply chains and technological integration. Game design has similarly progressed from simple mechanics to intricate narratives and immersive environments. Understanding the historical context of both fields provides a foundation for exploring their intersection.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current literature in logistics emphasizes efficiency, coordination, and sustainability, while game design focuses on player experience, narrative development, and engagement strategies. However, there is a lack of research exploring the integration of logistics concepts into game design, highlighting a significant gap in the literature.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
