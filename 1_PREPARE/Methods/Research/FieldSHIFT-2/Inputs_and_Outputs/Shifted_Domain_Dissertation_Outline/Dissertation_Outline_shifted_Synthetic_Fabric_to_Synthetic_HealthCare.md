# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from the Fabric Industry and Arts to Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with health care, proposing a transformative approach that integrates artistry, sustainability, and community engagement into patient care. By examining the parallels between these domains, the research aims to develop new models, frameworks, and methodologies that enhance patient experiences, improve health outcomes, and promote sustainable practices. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering practical applications in health care design, policy, and community health initiatives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of the fabric industry and arts with health care represents a novel approach to patient-centered care. Historically, both domains have emphasized creativity, sustainability, and community involvement, yet they have remained largely distinct. This dissertation seeks to bridge this gap, drawing on the rich traditions of textile design and artistic expression to inform and enhance health care practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize health care environments and patient experiences. By incorporating artistic elements and sustainable practices from the fabric industry, health care can evolve into a more holistic and engaging field. This novel approach not only addresses current challenges in patient engagement and satisfaction but also fosters a deeper connection between health care providers and the communities they serve.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from the fabric industry enhance the design and function of health care environments?
2. What is the impact of arts-based therapies on patient outcomes and satisfaction?
3. How can sustainability practices from the fabric industry be integrated into health care operations?
4. In what ways can community engagement initiatives, inspired by fabric workshops, empower patients in their health care journeys?
