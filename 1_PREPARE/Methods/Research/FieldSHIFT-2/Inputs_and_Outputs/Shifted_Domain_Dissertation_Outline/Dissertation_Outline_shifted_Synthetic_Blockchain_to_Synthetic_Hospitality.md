## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The intersection of blockchain technology and guest experience represents a novel approach to enhancing the hospitality industry. Blockchain, originally developed to facilitate secure financial transactions, has evolved into a versatile tool with applications across various sectors. The guest experience domain focuses on the quality of service and interactions guests have with hospitality providers. The fusion of these two fields presents opportunities for innovation that can redefine guest interactions and service delivery.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the pressing need for enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency in guest experiences. The novelty lies in applying blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature to traditional hospitality practices, thereby creating a more trustworthy and efficient system for managing guest interactions. This dissertation will contribute to both fields by providing a theoretical framework and practical applications for blockchain in hospitality.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology enhance trust and transparency in guest experiences?
2. What are the implications of implementing smart contracts for service delivery in hospitality?
3. How can tokenization of loyalty programs improve guest retention and satisfaction?
4. What challenges and opportunities arise from integrating blockchain into the guest experience?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain:** Originating with Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has evolved through various iterations, including Ethereum and Hyperledger, focusing on decentralized applications and enterprise solutions.
- **Guest Experience:** The hospitality industry has progressed from basic service models to complex, technology-driven experiences that prioritize personalization and quality service.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Blockchain:** Current research emphasizes its applications in finance, supply chain, and data security, with growing interest in its potential in other sectors.
- **Guest Experience:** Studies highlight the importance of personalization, service quality, and the integration of technology to meet evolving guest expectations.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Despite advancements in both fields, there is limited research on the application of blockchain technology specifically within the guest experience sector. This presents an opportunity to explore how blockchain can address current challenges, such as data security and service efficiency, while enhancing guest satisfaction.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Trust Theory:** Examines the role of trust in relationships and transactions, relevant to both blockchain and guest experiences.
- **Service Quality Models:** Frameworks such as SERVQUAL can be adapted to assess the impact of blockchain on service delivery.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Decentralized Trust Models:** Proposes that blockchain can create trust in service delivery through transparent and immutable records.
- **Co-Creation of Experiences:** Explores how blockchain empowers guests to participate actively in their service experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model combining trust theory, service quality frameworks, and decentralized trust concepts will guide the research, illustrating how blockchain can enhance guest experiences.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative surveys to measure guest satisfaction and qualitative interviews to explore perceptions of blockchain applications in hospitality.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Surveys:** Distributed to guests using traditional vs. blockchain-based services to assess satisfaction and trust levels.
- **Interviews:** Conducted with industry experts and hospitality managers to gain insights into the implementation of blockchain technologies.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Statistical methods to compare guest satisfaction metrics.
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Thematic analysis of interview data to identify common themes and insights.

### Ethical Considerations
Research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring informed consent, data privacy, and confidentiality for all participants.
