However, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an opportunity to decentralize these processes, enhancing guest experience through greater control, transparency, and automation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it represents a pioneering effort to apply blockchain principles to the hospitality sector. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of blockchain concepts to create new models for guest engagement that prioritize personalization and trust.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can decentralized guest profiles enhance personalization while maintaining privacy?
- What impact does transparency in service quality metrics have on guest trust and loyalty?
- In what ways can smart contracts streamline service recovery processes?
- How can tokenized loyalty programs foster greater guest engagement?
