# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the fabric industry and arts with traditional knowledge systems. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research will establish a novel framework that positions textiles as carriers of cultural and ecological wisdom. This interdisciplinary approach has profound implications for sustainability, cultural identity, and community engagement. The findings will contribute to academic discourse, inform policy, and promote innovative practices within both the fabric industry and traditional knowledge sectors.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry, characterized by creativity and sustainability, intersects with traditional knowledge, which embodies the collective wisdom of indigenous communities. This dissertation seeks to analyze how these two domains can inform and enhance each other, leading to a richer understanding of cultural practices and environmental stewardship.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it highlights the potential for textiles to serve as a medium for preserving and transmitting traditional knowledge. It offers a novel perspective that redefines textiles not merely as materials but as integral components of cultural heritage and ecological understanding.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the fabric industry be integrated into traditional knowledge systems?
2. What role do textiles play in preserving cultural identity and ecological practices?
3. How can this integration enhance community resilience and sustainability?
