# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Traditional Knowledge

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of the fabric industry and arts (Domain A) with traditional knowledge systems (Domain B). By analyzing the cultural, environmental, and economic implications of this Shifted Domain, the research will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding textiles as vessels of cultural identity and sustainable practices. The potential impact of this research extends to various fields, including cultural studies, environmental science, and sustainable development, ultimately contributing to a more integrated approach to textile production and cultural preservation.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long been recognized for its creativity, craftsmanship, and cultural significance. Simultaneously, traditional knowledge systems offer invaluable insights into sustainable practices and community engagement. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, recognizing textiles not merely as commodities but as integral components of cultural heritage and ecological sustainability.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The research is significant in its potential to redefine textiles within the context of traditional knowledge, providing a framework for understanding how cultural narratives are embedded in fabric. This novel perspective opens up new avenues for sustainable practices in the fabric industry and emphasizes the importance of preserving traditional knowledge.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can textiles be reimagined as a form of traditional knowledge that conveys cultural narratives and ecological wisdom?
2. In what ways can traditional knowledge systems inform sustainable practices in the fabric industry?
3. What educational frameworks can effectively integrate textile arts with traditional knowledge?
