# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating entomology into healthcare, creating a Shifted Domain that fosters innovative approaches to patient care, communication, and team dynamics. By leveraging insights from insect biology and behavior, the research will outline a new framework for understanding patient journeys, enhancing provider-patient interactions, and improving collaborative care models. The anticipated impact of this research includes improved patient outcomes, increased satisfaction, and a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration that can reshape healthcare practices.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of entomology and healthcare represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that seeks to draw parallels between the biological and social behaviors of insects and the complexities of patient care. Entomology provides rich insights into adaptability, communication, and social structures, all of which can inform and enhance healthcare practices.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional paradigms in healthcare by introducing biological models that emphasize adaptability, emotional communication, and teamwork. The novelty lies in the application of entomological principles to healthcare, which has not been extensively explored, thereby opening new avenues for research and practice.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the concept of metamorphosis be applied to create adaptable patient care models?
2. In what ways can chemical ecology inform provider-patient communication strategies?
3. How can the social structures of insect communities enhance teamwork and collaboration in healthcare settings?
