# Dissertation Plan: Transposing RxInfer.jl into the Context of Python Programming Language

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative transposition of the probabilistic programming capabilities of RxInfer.jl, a Julia package, into Python, a widely-used programming language. By developing a new library, tentatively named **PyInfer**, this research seeks to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling within the Python ecosystem. The significance of this work lies in its potential to bridge the gap between advanced statistical methodologies and practical programming applications, thereby expanding the toolkit available for data scientists, researchers, and practitioners. This dissertation will not only contribute to the academic discourse surrounding probabilistic programming but also have real-world implications across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and robotics.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of probabilistic programming and Python's programming capabilities. RxInfer.jl has established itself as a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling in Julia, leveraging advanced algorithms and frameworks. Conversely, Python's simplicity and extensive library ecosystem make it a preferred language for data analysis and machine learning. This dissertation seeks to analyze the strengths and limitations of both domains and to create a robust framework for probabilistic programming in Python.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The integration of RxInfer.jl methodologies into Python presents a novel approach to enhancing probabilistic programming capabilities in a language that is already popular among data scientists. This research will innovate by providing a new library that combines the strengths of both domains, addressing existing challenges in performance and usability.
