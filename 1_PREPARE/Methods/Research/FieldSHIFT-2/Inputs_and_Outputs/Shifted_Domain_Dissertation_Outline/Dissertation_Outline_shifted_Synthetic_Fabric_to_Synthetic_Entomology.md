# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Concepts from the Fabric Industry and Arts to Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with entomology, creating a Shifted Domain that leverages the principles of craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural significance inherent in textiles to address contemporary challenges in insect conservation and sustainable agriculture. By investigating the isomorphisms between these two fields, the research will generate new theoretical constructs and practical applications that promote biodiversity, enhance sustainable practices, and foster a deeper cultural appreciation for insects. The anticipated impact includes advancing interdisciplinary research, informing policy, and revolutionizing educational approaches in both domains.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry and arts (Domain A) have historically emphasized craftsmanship, sustainability, and cultural narratives through textiles. Concurrently, entomology (Domain B) has focused on understanding insect biology and ecology, addressing critical challenges such as declining populations and environmental sustainability. This dissertation will synthesize these two domains, revealing synergies that can lead to innovative solutions for both the fabric industry and entomological research.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novel integration of textile design principles with entomological practices presents a unique opportunity to develop sustainable solutions for pest management and conservation strategies. This research will contribute to the emerging field of entomo-textile studies, providing a framework that highlights the importance of insects in cultural heritage and ecological sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of sustainable textile design inform practices in entomology?
2. In what ways can insect patterns and structures inspire innovative textile designs?
3. What is the cultural significance of insects, and how can this be leveraged for conservation efforts?
