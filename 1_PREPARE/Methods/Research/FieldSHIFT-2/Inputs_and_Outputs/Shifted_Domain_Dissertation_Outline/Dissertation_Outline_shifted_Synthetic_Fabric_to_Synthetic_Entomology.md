# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts with entomology, proposing a transformative framework that integrates creative design principles and sustainable practices from textiles into the scientific study of insects. By examining the isomorphisms between these domains, the research aims to develop new methodologies, theoretical constructs, and practical applications that address ecological challenges while fostering public appreciation for insects. The potential impact of this work includes advancing interdisciplinary research, informing sustainable practices in agriculture, and enhancing educational approaches in both fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of the fabric industry and arts with entomology represents a novel approach to understanding the intricate relationships between creativity, sustainability, and ecological systems. This interdisciplinary domain leverages the aesthetic and functional aspects of textiles to inform entomological research and practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between art and science, proposing that the principles of textile design can enrich entomological studies. The novelty lies in the development of a new lexicon and theoretical framework that encapsulates this intersection, offering fresh perspectives on ecological resilience and sustainability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of textile design enhance our understanding of insect morphology and behavior?
2. In what ways can sustainable practices from the fabric industry inform pest management and conservation strategies in entomology?
3. What are the cultural implications of integrating artistic representation of insects into public awareness and education?

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the intersections of the two domains.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Qualitative:** Interviews with textile designers and entomologists, focus groups on public perceptions.
- **Quantitative:** Field studies measuring biodiversity in agricultural settings employing textile-inspired pest management practices.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis of qualitative data.
- Statistical analysis of biodiversity metrics in agricultural studies.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring ethical treatment of insects in research, transparency in data collection, and consideration of cultural sensitivities in artistic representations.
