# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference with game design. By applying concepts from adaptive systems, predictive coding, and variational free energy, this research aims to revolutionize how games are created and experienced. The proposed framework will address current challenges in player engagement, game balance, and narrative design, ultimately leading to more responsive and satisfying gaming experiences. This work not only contributes to game design but also opens avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation across diverse fields.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Free Energy Principle (FEP) posits that biological systems strive to minimize their variational free energy through adaptive behaviors. Active Inference extends this idea, suggesting that organisms actively engage with their environments to confirm their internal models. Game design, traditionally focused on engagement and player experience, can benefit from these principles by creating adaptive, predictive systems that enhance player interaction and satisfaction.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research represents a groundbreaking fusion of neuroscience, psychology, and game design, offering a novel framework for understanding player engagement and game mechanics. By applying FEP and Active Inference, this dissertation seeks to redefine game design methodologies, leading to innovations that improve player retention and satisfaction in an increasingly competitive market.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be effectively integrated into game design?
2. What are the implications of predictive coding for player engagement and narrative design?
3. How can dynamic game balancing enhance player experiences and satisfaction?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

- **Free Energy Principle & Active Inference**: Theoretical foundations rooted in biology and neuroscience, emphasizing adaptive behavior and predictive modeling.
- **Game Design**: An evolution from simple mechanics to complex systems that integrate narrative, graphics, and player interaction.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

- The FEP has influenced fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics, while game design continues to grapple with challenges related to player engagement and innovation.
- Both domains share underlying structures related to adaptive systems and feedback loops, yet have remained largely distinct.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

- There is a lack of interdisciplinary research that applies concepts from FEP to game design, creating a unique opportunity to enhance understanding and innovation in both fields.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

- **Variational Inference**: A method for approximating complex distributions, applicable to both biological systems and machine learning.
- **Predictive Coding**: A framework for understanding how organisms generate and update predictions about sensory inputs.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

- **Adaptive Game Mechanics**: Game systems that evolve based on player interactions and feedback.
- **Predictive Engagement**: Player satisfaction derived from successful predictions within gameplay.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A model that synthesizes concepts from FEP and Active Inference with game design principles, emphasizing the importance of adaptive mechanics, predictive models, and player engagement.
