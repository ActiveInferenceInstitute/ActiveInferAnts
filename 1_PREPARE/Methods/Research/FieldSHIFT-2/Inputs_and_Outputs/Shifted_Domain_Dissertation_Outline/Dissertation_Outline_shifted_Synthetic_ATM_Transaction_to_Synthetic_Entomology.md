This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, offering fresh perspectives on insect behavior and management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The proposed research is significant as it challenges traditional paradigms in both banking and biological sciences. By introducing transaction-based models to entomological studies, this work aims to provide innovative methodologies for studying insect life cycles, communication, and resource allocation. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary framework that can lead to practical applications in pest management and conservation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ATM transaction models enhance our understanding of insect life cycles?
2. In what ways do chemical communication and authentication parallels exist between ATMs and insect behavior?
3. What are the implications of applying transaction-based principles to ecological monitoring and pest management?
