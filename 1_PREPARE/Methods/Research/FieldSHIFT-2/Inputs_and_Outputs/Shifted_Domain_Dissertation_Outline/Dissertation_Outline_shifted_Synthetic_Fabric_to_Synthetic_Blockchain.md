# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into the Context of Blockchain Technology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and blockchain technology, proposing a transformative framework that integrates principles of creativity, sustainability, and cultural expression from the fabric domain into the decentralized, transparent, and secure environment of blockchain. The research aims to establish a new paradigm called **Textile Blockchain**, which not only enhances the fabric industry's operational practices but also redefines blockchain applications in creative domains. The significance of this research lies in its potential to foster ethical practices, empower artisans, and promote sustainability, ultimately reshaping consumer relationships with textiles and technology.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry is characterized by its rich history of craftsmanship, creativity, and cultural significance. In contrast, blockchain technology, with its emphasis on decentralization and transparency, offers new avenues for innovation in various sectors. The convergence of these two domains presents unique opportunities to enhance both the fabric industry and blockchain applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it fills a critical gap in both fields by demonstrating how blockchain can be utilized to promote sustainable practices, enhance traceability, and support artisans in the fabric industry. It introduces novel concepts such as **Artisan Blockchains** and **Cultural Tokenization**, which can redefine how we perceive value and authenticity in textiles.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can blockchain technology be effectively integrated into the fabric industry to enhance sustainability and transparency?
2. What new theoretical models can emerge from the intersection of these two domains?
3. How can the principles of craftsmanship and cultural narratives reshape blockchain applications?
