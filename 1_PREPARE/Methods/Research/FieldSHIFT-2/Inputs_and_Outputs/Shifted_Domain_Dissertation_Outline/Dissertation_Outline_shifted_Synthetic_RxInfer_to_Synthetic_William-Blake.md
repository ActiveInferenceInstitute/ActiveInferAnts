# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from RxInfer.jl to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of probabilistic programming, specifically through the lens of the RxInfer.jl package, and the artistic and spiritual dimensions of William Blake's life and work. By applying Bayesian inference methodologies to the analysis of Blake's poetry and visual art, this research seeks to establish a new theoretical framework that highlights the complexity and dynamism of human experience as reflected in artistic expression. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize both the fields of data science and art criticism, providing fresh insights into creativity, perception, and the interplay of imagination and reason.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: probabilistic programming, as exemplified by RxInfer.jl, and the literary and artistic analysis of William Blake's oeuvre. This interdisciplinary approach opens new avenues for understanding how complex systems of meaning can be modeled and interpreted, bridging quantitative methodologies with qualitative insights.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges traditional paradigms in both domains. By applying probabilistic modeling to Blake's work, we can uncover deeper layers of meaning and complexity, allowing for a richer interpretation that transcends conventional literary analysis. The novelty lies in the methodological innovation of using Bayesian inference to reframe artistic expression as a dynamic and probabilistic process.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Bayesian inference methodologies be applied to analyze the themes and structures within Blake's poetry and art?
2. In what ways does Blake's exploration of duality and imagination resonate with concepts in probabilistic modeling?
3. What new theoretical frameworks emerge from this interdisciplinary approach, and how can they inform future research in both fields?
