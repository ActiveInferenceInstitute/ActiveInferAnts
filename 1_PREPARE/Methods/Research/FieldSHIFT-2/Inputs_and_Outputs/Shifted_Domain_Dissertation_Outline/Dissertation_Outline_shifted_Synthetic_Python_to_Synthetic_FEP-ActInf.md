# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Python Programming Language into the Context of the Free Energy Principle & Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between Python programming and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with Active Inference. By transposing the core principles of Python—its adaptability, dynamic typing, and extensive libraries—into the framework of cognitive processes described by FEP, this research will propose a new model of cognition as a form of programming. This interdisciplinary approach holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cognitive flexibility and adaptability, leading to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and educational methodologies.
