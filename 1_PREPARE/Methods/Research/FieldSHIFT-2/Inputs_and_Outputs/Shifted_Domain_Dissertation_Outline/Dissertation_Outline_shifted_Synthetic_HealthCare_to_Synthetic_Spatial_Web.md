## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of health care and the Spatial Web represents a groundbreaking shift in how we understand user experiences and interactions. Health care has long emphasized patient-centered care, focusing on individual needs and preferences, while the Spatial Web integrates physical and digital realms through technologies like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This dissertation will explore how principles from health care can enhance user experiences in the Spatial Web.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the current gaps in user engagement and satisfaction within digital environments. By applying health care principles to the Spatial Web, the dissertation seeks to create a novel framework that emphasizes empathy, personalization, and quality of experience. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of healthcare concepts to digital design, fostering a new understanding of user interactions.
