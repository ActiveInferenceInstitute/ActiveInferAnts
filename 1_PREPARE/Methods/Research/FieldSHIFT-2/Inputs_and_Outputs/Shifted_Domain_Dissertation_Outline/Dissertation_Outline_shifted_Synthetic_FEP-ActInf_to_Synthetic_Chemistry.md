# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Applying the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI) into the field of Chemistry. By establishing a novel framework that applies these concepts to chemical reactions, this research aims to revolutionize our understanding of chemical processes, enhance predictive modeling, and optimize reaction design. The potential impact of this work extends beyond theoretical advancements, offering practical applications in sustainable chemistry and materials science. This dissertation will contribute to the emergence of new interdisciplinary fields while addressing significant challenges in current chemical paradigms.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems minimize variational free energy, a concept traditionally applied in biological and cognitive sciences. Chemistry, on the other hand, focuses on the properties and transformations of matter. The fusion of these two domains presents an opportunity to address complex challenges in chemical reactions through predictive modeling and iterative experimentation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a paradigm shift in how chemical processes are understood and approached. By applying the FEP and AI to chemistry, we can develop predictive models that enhance reaction outcomes and foster sustainable practices. The novelty lies in the transposition of principles from cognitive science to a traditionally distinct field, creating a new lexicon and framework for understanding chemical dynamics.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the Free Energy Principle be applied to model chemical reactions?
2. In what ways can Active Inference enhance the design and optimization of chemical experiments?
3. What are the implications of this interdisciplinary approach for the future of chemistry and related fields?
