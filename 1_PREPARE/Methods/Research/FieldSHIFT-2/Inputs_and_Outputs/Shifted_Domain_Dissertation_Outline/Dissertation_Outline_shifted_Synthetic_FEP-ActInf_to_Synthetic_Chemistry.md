# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating the Free Energy Principle with Chemical Reactions

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) with the domain of chemical reactions. By applying concepts of adaptive systems, prediction, and minimization of surprise from the FEP to chemical processes, this research proposes a novel framework that redefines our understanding of chemical dynamics. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enhance predictive capabilities in chemistry, optimize catalytic processes, and foster sustainable practices. This dissertation will contribute to both theoretical advancements and practical applications, positioning the Shifted Domain at the forefront of interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that adaptive systems strive to minimize their variational free energy to maintain stability. In contrast, traditional chemical reaction theories focus on kinetics, thermodynamics, and equilibrium. The intersection of these two domains presents an opportunity to develop a more holistic understanding of chemical processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a paradigm shift in how chemical reactions are conceptualized, emphasizing their adaptive and predictive nature. By framing chemical reactions as systems that minimize free energy, we can uncover new insights into reaction mechanisms and catalyst efficiency.
