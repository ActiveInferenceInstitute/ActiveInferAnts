# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Physical Security Principles into Healthcare

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating physical security principles into healthcare settings. By examining the intersection of these two domains, the research will identify innovative strategies to enhance patient safety, improve healthcare outcomes, and foster a culture of security within healthcare environments. The findings will contribute to the development of new theoretical models and practical applications, ultimately impacting policy, industry practices, and societal perceptions of safety in healthcare.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative convergence of physical security and healthcare, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Physical security focuses on protecting assets and personnel from threats, while healthcare prioritizes patient care and safety. As healthcare environments become increasingly complex and vulnerable to various risks, the need for a cohesive approach that incorporates security principles is evident.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both fields, offering a novel perspective on patient safety and care quality. By integrating physical security strategies into healthcare, the dissertation will provide a framework for enhancing patient experiences, ensuring safety, and improving operational efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can physical security measures be effectively integrated into healthcare environments to enhance patient safety?
2. What are the implications of this integration for patient experiences and healthcare outcomes?
3. What new theoretical models emerge from the intersection of physical security and healthcare?
