# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Negotiation into Prediction Matter Expertise (PME)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of negotiation and Prediction Matter Expertise (PME), proposing a transformative framework that integrates negotiation principles into predictive practices. By leveraging negotiation strategies, skills, and ethical considerations, this research seeks to enhance the accuracy of predictions and foster collaborative decision-making across various domains. The potential impact of this work includes improved predictive analytics, enriched interdisciplinary collaboration, and the establishment of a new lexicon that bridges both fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
Negotiation is traditionally viewed as a process for reaching agreements, while PME focuses on synthesizing knowledge for informed predictions. The convergence of these domains presents a unique opportunity to enhance predictive accuracy through negotiation strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the gaps in both fields by introducing negotiation as a critical component of PME. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of negotiation concepts into predictive frameworks, creating a new paradigm for decision-making.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can negotiation tactics enhance the effectiveness of predictive analytics?
- What role does emotional intelligence play in improving predictive accuracy in PME?
- How can cross-disciplinary collaboration in negotiation practices lead to innovative predictive models?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- Overview of negotiation theories and practices.
- Development of PME as a discipline and its evolution.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Summary of key findings in negotiation and PME.
- Analysis of existing frameworks and methodologies.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of the lack of interdisciplinary approaches.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Introduction of "Negotiative Synthesis" as a new construct.
- Exploration of "Cultural Predictive Awareness."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- Development of a model that illustrates the interaction between negotiation and PME components.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with stakeholders in both fields.
- Case studies of successful integration of negotiation in predictive contexts.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring informed consent and confidentiality.
- Addressing potential biases in data interpretation.
