# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Astronomy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating non-science ways of knowing—such as cultural narratives, intuitive insights, and emotional engagement—into the field of astronomy. By bridging the gap between empirical scientific methods and subjective, experiential knowledge, this research aims to create a more holistic understanding of celestial phenomena. The significance of this work lies in its potential to enrich public engagement, enhance scientific discovery, and foster deeper connections between humanity and the cosmos. The dissertation will present a comprehensive framework for this integration, including theoretical constructs, methodological innovations, and practical applications, ultimately establishing a new interdisciplinary field of "Cultural Astronomy."

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between non-science ways of knowing and the empirical discipline of astronomy. Historically, these two realms have operated in silos, with science prioritizing quantitative data while non-science approaches have been marginalized. This dissertation seeks to challenge this dichotomy by demonstrating the value of integrating diverse epistemologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant because it addresses the limitations of traditional scientific paradigms by incorporating holistic and culturally relevant perspectives. The novelty lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which combines insights from anthropology, psychology, and the arts to foster a richer understanding of astronomical phenomena.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can cultural narratives enhance our understanding of celestial phenomena?
2. What role does intuition play in the scientific discovery process within astronomy?
3. How can emotional engagement strategies improve public understanding and participation in astronomy?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Non-Science Ways of Knowing**: Exploration of indigenous knowledge systems, spirituality, and artistic expressions.
- **Astronomy**: Development from ancient star-gazing to modern astrophysics.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- Examination of contemporary research in both non-scientific and scientific domains, highlighting the divide and potential for integration.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Identification of underexplored areas where cultural insights can inform astronomical research and vice versa.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- Overview of key theories in non-science knowledge (e.g., narrative theory, emotional intelligence) and astronomy (e.g., relativity, quantum mechanics).

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Development of concepts such as "Cultural Astronomy" and "Intuitive Scientific Inquiry."

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
- A visual representation of how non-science ways of knowing can inform and enhance traditional astronomical practices.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
- Mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research.

### Data Collection Methods
- Ethnographic studies, interviews with astronomers and cultural practitioners, and analysis of cultural narratives.

### Analytical Approaches
- Thematic analysis for qualitative data and statistical methods for quantitative data.

### Ethical Considerations
- Ensuring respectful engagement with cultural narratives and prioritizing indigenous voices.
