By adopting a holistic, sustainable, and collaborative approach, this research seeks to address existing challenges in health care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and promote a more equitable health care system. The significance of this study lies in its potential to create a new paradigm for health care that aligns with contemporary needs while fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation. The anticipated impact extends beyond health care, influencing environmental sustainability and community well-being.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
Buckminster Fuller was a visionary thinker whose ideas on sustainability, systems thinking, and design science have gained renewed relevance in today’s context of global challenges. Health care, traditionally characterized by fragmentation and inefficiencies, stands to benefit from Fuller's holistic and integrative principles. This dissertation will investigate how these principles can be applied to create more effective, patient-centered health care systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging principles from architecture, design, and sustainability with health care practices. By applying Fuller's concepts, this study aims to redefine health care delivery, emphasizing sustainability and holistic patient care. This research is significant as it addresses pressing issues such as health inequities, environmental impact, and the need for innovative solutions in health care.
