# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Buckminster Fuller’s Concepts into Health Care

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Buckminster Fuller’s innovative concepts into the health care sector. By applying Fuller's principles of holistic thinking, ephemeralization, synergetics, and tensegrity, this research seeks to develop a framework that enhances patient care, improves operational efficiency, and promotes sustainability within health care systems. The anticipated impact of this research extends beyond academia, promising to influence health care practices, policy-making, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately leading to a more resilient and equitable health care landscape.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the visionary ideas of Buckminster Fuller—an architect, designer, and futurist—with the complex and often fragmented field of health care. Fuller's focus on systems thinking and sustainable design offers a unique lens through which to examine and innovate health care delivery.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms in health care by introducing a holistic, systems-based approach. The novelty lies in the application of Fuller's design principles to create integrated care models that prioritize patient experience, sustainability, and efficiency.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller's principles be systematically integrated into health care delivery models?
2. What impact does the application of these principles have on patient outcomes and system efficiency?
3. How can interdisciplinary collaborations enhance the implementation of these innovative frameworks in health care?
