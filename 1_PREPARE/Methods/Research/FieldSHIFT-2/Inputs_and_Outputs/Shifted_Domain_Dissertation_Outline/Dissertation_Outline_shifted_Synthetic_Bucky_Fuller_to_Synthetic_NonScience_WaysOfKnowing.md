# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Buckminster Fuller’s Design Science to Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating Buckminster Fuller’s design science principles with non-science ways of knowing. The research aims to create an innovative framework that honors both empirical and experiential knowledge, fostering sustainable solutions to complex global challenges. By bridging these two distinct fields, the dissertation seeks to contribute significantly to interdisciplinary scholarship, education, and practical applications, ultimately promoting a more holistic understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge systems.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of Buckminster Fuller’s design science—characterized by holistic, anticipatory problem-solving—and non-science ways of knowing, which include intuitive, cultural, and experiential knowledge systems. This integration aims to address the limitations of traditional scientific approaches by recognizing the value of diverse perspectives in understanding and solving complex issues.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the prevailing dichotomy between science and non-science, advocating for a more inclusive epistemological framework. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of Fuller’s principles into non-scientific contexts, creating a new paradigm for problem-solving that emphasizes sustainability, community engagement, and cultural sensitivity.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Fuller’s design science principles be effectively integrated with non-science ways of knowing?
2. What are the potential benefits and challenges of this integration for addressing global challenges?
3. How can new theoretical constructs emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
