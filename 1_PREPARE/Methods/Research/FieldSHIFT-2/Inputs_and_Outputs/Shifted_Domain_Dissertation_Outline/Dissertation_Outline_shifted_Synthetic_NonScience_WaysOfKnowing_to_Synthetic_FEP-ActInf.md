# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of non-science ways of knowing into the established frameworks of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI). By investigating the epistemological richness of intuitive, cultural, and holistic approaches, we propose a transformative model that enhances our understanding of cognition and adaptive behavior. This research holds significant implications for cognitive science, environmental management, education, and community well-being, paving the way for interdisciplinary collaborations and practical applications that honor diverse forms of knowledge.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of cognitive science and non-science epistemologies, emphasizing the value of subjective experience, cultural narratives, and holistic perspectives in understanding adaptive systems. This integration recognizes the limitations of purely empirical approaches and seeks to enrich scientific inquiry by incorporating diverse ways of knowing.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking in its approach to bridging the gap between scientific and non-scientific knowledge systems. By examining how intuitive, cultural, and holistic frameworks can inform and enhance the FEP and AI, we aim to develop a more nuanced understanding of cognition that reflects the complexity of human experience. This novel perspective has the potential to transform educational practices, environmental management strategies, and community health initiatives.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance predictive coding and active inference models?
2. What is the role of cultural narratives as generative models in community behavior and environmental management?
3. How can holistic approaches in active inference lead to improved health outcomes and adaptive behaviors?
4. What are the implications of integrating these frameworks for interdisciplinary research and practice?
