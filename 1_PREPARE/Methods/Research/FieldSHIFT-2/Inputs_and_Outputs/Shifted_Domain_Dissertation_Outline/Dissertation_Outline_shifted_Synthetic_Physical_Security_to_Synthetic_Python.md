# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Physical Security into Python Programming

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of physical security principles and Python programming, aiming to create a comprehensive framework that enhances software security. By integrating established methodologies from physical security—such as access control, surveillance, and environmental design—into Python programming, the research seeks to address current vulnerabilities in software applications. The potential impact of this work includes improved security practices in software development, the establishment of new educational paradigms, and the creation of interdisciplinary collaborations that bridge the gap between physical and digital security domains.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The rapid evolution of technology has led to an increasing need for robust security measures in software applications. While physical security has long been established as a critical field for protecting tangible assets, its principles have not been sufficiently applied to the realm of software development. This dissertation proposes a framework that merges these two domains, leveraging the strengths of both to create a more secure digital environment.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it fills a critical gap in the current understanding of software security by applying proven physical security strategies to Python programming. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach, which not only enhances the security of applications but also introduces new methodologies and educational practices in programming.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of physical security be effectively integrated into Python programming?
2. What are the potential impacts of this integration on software security vulnerabilities?
3. How can the findings inform educational practices and industry standards in programming?
