# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The fusion of culinary arts and ecological science represents an innovative Shifted Domain that recognizes the interdependencies between food systems and ecosystems. Cuisine, with its rich traditions and diverse practices, can serve as a model for understanding and managing ecological systems. Conversely, ecological principles can provide insights into sustainable culinary practices that respect biodiversity and environmental health.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional boundaries between culinary arts and ecological science, proposing a novel framework that highlights their interconnections. By emphasizing the shared principles of diversity, transformation, and adaptation, this dissertation aims to contribute to both fields by offering new methodologies and theoretical constructs that can lead to practical applications in sustainability.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can culinary principles be applied to enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics?
2. In what ways can ecological concepts inform sustainable culinary practices?
3. What frameworks can be developed to integrate culinary arts and ecological science for improved resilience and sustainability?
