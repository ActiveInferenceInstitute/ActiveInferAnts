# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Concepts to Blockchain Technology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of health care principles and blockchain technology, creating a Shifted Domain that enhances user experience, service quality, and sustainability in decentralized applications. By investigating the synergies between patient-centered care and blockchain's user-centric design, this research will develop novel frameworks, metrics, and smart contracts that redefine user engagement in blockchain systems. The potential impact of this work extends to both fields, paving the way for new sub-disciplines and practical applications that address pressing societal challenges.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a confluence of health care and blockchain technology, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Health care focuses on patient experience, service quality, and technological integration, while blockchain emphasizes decentralization, security, and transaction integrity. This dissertation will analyze how principles from health care can be transposed into blockchain to improve user engagement and operational efficiency.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses critical gaps in both fields. In health care, there is a growing need for improved patient engagement and personalized care. In blockchain, user adoption and satisfaction remain challenges. By integrating concepts from health care into blockchain, this dissertation proposes a novel approach that enhances both user experience and service quality, ultimately benefiting both sectors.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can user feedback mechanisms from health care improve blockchain application development?
2. What are the impacts of adaptive smart contracts on user engagement and compliance in decentralized applications?
3. How can sustainability practices in blockchain influence user trust and community engagement?
