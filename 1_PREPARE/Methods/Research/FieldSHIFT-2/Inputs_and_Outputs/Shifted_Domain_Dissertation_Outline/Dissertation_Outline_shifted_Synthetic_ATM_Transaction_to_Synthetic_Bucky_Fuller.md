# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing ATM Transaction Concepts into Buckminster Fuller's Framework

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of ATM transaction principles and Buckminster Fuller's holistic design philosophy. By transposing the efficiency, accessibility, and security of ATM transactions into Fuller's framework of sustainable design and systems thinking, this research aims to develop a novel model for resource management and service delivery. The proposed Dymaxion kiosks will serve as a practical application of this model, addressing global challenges through community engagement and innovative technology. This research not only contributes to academic discourse but also has the potential to influence industry practices, policy frameworks, and societal approaches to resource distribution.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges two distinct fields: the operational principles of ATM transactions and the visionary design philosophy of Buckminster Fuller. ATMs revolutionized banking by offering self-service, secure, and efficient transaction processes, while Fuller advocated for holistic, sustainable solutions to global issues through innovative design.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel framework that combines transactional efficiency with sustainable design. By applying Fuller's principles to the operational aspects of ATMs, we can explore new avenues for enhancing accessibility to essential services, particularly in underserved communities.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of ATM transactions be effectively transposed into Buckminster Fuller's design framework?
2. What are the implications of this transposition for resource management and community service delivery?
3. How can the proposed Dymaxion kiosks enhance accessibility and sustainability in resource transactions?
