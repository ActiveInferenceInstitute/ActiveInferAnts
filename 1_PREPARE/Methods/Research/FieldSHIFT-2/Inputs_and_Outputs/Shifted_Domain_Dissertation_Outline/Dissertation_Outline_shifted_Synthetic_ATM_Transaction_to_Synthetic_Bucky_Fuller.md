# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing ATM Transactions to Buckminster Fuller’s Design Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative integration of principles derived from ATM transactions with Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy. By examining the isomorphisms between these two domains, we aim to redefine user experience, security, and resource management in architectural design. This research not only addresses gaps in both fields but also proposes a novel framework for sustainable and user-centered design, with the potential to significantly impact urban planning and architecture. The findings from this study will contribute to the development of adaptive structures that enhance public trust and engagement while promoting resource efficiency.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of ATM transaction principles with Fuller’s design philosophy represents a shift towards a more integrated approach to user-centered design in architecture. ATMs have revolutionized banking by providing self-service, security, and accessibility, while Fuller’s work emphasizes holistic thinking and sustainable solutions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a fresh perspective on how user-centered design and resource efficiency can inform architectural practices. The novelty lies in the application of ATM methodologies to create adaptive and sustainable urban environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can user-centered design principles from ATM transactions enhance architectural practices?
2. In what ways can security protocols from ATM systems inform trust in public spaces?
3. What methodologies can be developed to implement dynamic resource management in urban design?
