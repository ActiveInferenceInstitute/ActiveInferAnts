# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles to Chemistry

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating health care principles into the field of chemistry, creating a novel interdisciplinary domain called "Patient-Centric Chemistry." By examining the parallels between patient-centered care and molecular interactions, this research seeks to establish new methodologies for drug design, chemical synthesis, and sustainability practices. The anticipated outcomes include enhanced drug efficacy, improved user satisfaction, and reduced environmental impact, ultimately contributing to a more holistic understanding of chemistry's role in society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of health care and chemistry represents a groundbreaking shift that challenges traditional paradigms in both fields. While health care emphasizes human experiences and outcomes, chemistry focuses on the properties and behaviors of matter. This dissertation proposes a framework that combines these perspectives, leading to innovative practices and methodologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a fresh approach to chemical practices by prioritizing user-centered design principles. The novelty lies in the systematic application of health care methodologies to chemistry, which has the potential to yield new insights and applications that have not been previously explored.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can health care principles enhance chemical practices, particularly in drug design and synthesis?
2. What methodologies can be developed to implement patient-centered approaches in chemistry?
3. What are the potential impacts of this integration on sustainability and public health?
