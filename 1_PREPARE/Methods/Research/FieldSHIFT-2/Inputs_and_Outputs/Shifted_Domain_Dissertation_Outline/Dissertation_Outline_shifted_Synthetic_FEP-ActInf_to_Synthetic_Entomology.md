# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Free Energy Principle into Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating the Free Energy Principle (FEP) from cognitive science into the field of entomology. By framing insect behavior through the lens of FEP, this research will elucidate the adaptive strategies of insects, providing novel insights into their ecological roles and behaviors. The significance of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, which not only enhances our understanding of insect biology but also informs practical applications in pest management and biodiversity conservation. The potential impact of this work extends to advancing educational frameworks within entomology, fostering a new generation of researchers equipped with innovative perspectives.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle posits that biological organisms strive to minimize variational free energy to maintain their functional integrity. Insects, as one of the most diverse and ecologically significant groups of organisms, exhibit complex behaviors and adaptive strategies that can be examined through this principle.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research represents a novel intersection between cognitive science and entomology, proposing that insect behavior can be understood as a process of minimizing surprise and optimizing decision-making. This interdisciplinary approach challenges traditional paradigms and opens new avenues for research and application.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can the Free Energy Principle be applied to understand insect behavior?
- What are the implications of this application for pest management and biodiversity conservation?
- How can educational frameworks in entomology be transformed through this interdisciplinary lens?
