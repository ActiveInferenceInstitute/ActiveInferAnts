# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Application of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference to Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of cognitive science and entomology by applying the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference to understand insect behavior and ecology. The research will provide a comprehensive framework that posits insects as active agents capable of minimizing surprise through predictive coding and adaptive behaviors. By integrating these concepts, the dissertation seeks to revolutionize our understanding of insect cognition, enhance ecological models, and inform practical applications in pest management and robotics. The potential impact of this research spans multiple disciplines, offering insights into ecological dynamics, cognitive processes, and the development of bio-inspired technologies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference represent a paradigm shift in cognitive science, suggesting that all living systems aim to minimize free energy through predictive processing and adaptive behavior. Entomology, the study of insects, has traditionally focused on ecological roles and behaviors without incorporating cognitive frameworks. This dissertation proposes a synthesis of these domains to uncover deeper insights into insect behavior.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a novel theoretical lens through which to examine insect behavior, positing that insects operate based on predictive models and active inference. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches entomological research but also offers new methodologies for studying complex biological systems.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to understand predictive behaviors in insects?
2. What are the implications of these concepts for the ecological roles of insects?
3. How can insights from this research inform practical applications in technology and pest management?
