# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transforming Logistics through the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative integration of logistics with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference (AI), creating a Shifted Domain that redefines supply chain management. By conceptualizing logistics as an adaptive system that minimizes variational free energy, this research will uncover new methodologies and frameworks that enhance operational efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability. The potential impact of this research extends beyond logistics, influencing cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and environmental sustainability, ultimately revolutionizing how organizations manage supply chains in an increasingly complex and dynamic environment.
