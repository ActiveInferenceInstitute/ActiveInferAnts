# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Guest Experience Concepts from Hospitality to Entomological Research

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry and entomological research. By examining how concepts such as personalization, service quality, technology integration, and sustainability can be transposed into insect research, this work seeks to foster community engagement, enhance data accuracy, and promote biodiversity conservation. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform both fields, creating a new paradigm for understanding and valuing insect ecosystems while improving public perception and involvement. This dissertation will provide a comprehensive framework for integrating these domains, offering a roadmap for future research and practical applications.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on enhancing guest experiences through tailored services and quality interactions. In contrast, entomological research has primarily concentrated on understanding insect biodiversity, behavior, and conservation without significant emphasis on public engagement or experience. This dissertation explores how principles from hospitality can invigorate entomological research and promote sustainable practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two disparate fields, creating a novel interdisciplinary approach that emphasizes community involvement and sustainability. By applying guest experience concepts to entomology, this work not only addresses the pressing challenges of declining insect populations but also enhances the societal relevance of insect research.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can community engagement in insect research enhance biodiversity conservation efforts?
2. What are the impacts of technology-driven citizen science on public perception of insect importance?
3. How can high-quality research standards improve the efficacy of conservation strategies for declining insect populations?
