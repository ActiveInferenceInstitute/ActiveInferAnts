# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from Guest Experience in Hospitality to Insect Experience in Entomology

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection between guest experience in hospitality and insect experience in entomology, proposing a new framework that integrates principles from both fields. By redefining how we understand insect interactions within their ecosystems, this research seeks to uncover transformative insights that can enhance conservation strategies, inform sustainable practices, and inspire technological innovations. The anticipated impact of this research includes a shift in entomological studies towards a more experiential understanding of insects, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and practical applications across various sectors.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has long focused on optimizing guest experiences through personalized services and emotional connections. Conversely, entomology has traditionally concentrated on the scientific study of insects, often neglecting the subjective experiences of these organisms within their environments. This dissertation proposes a novel approach that bridges these two domains, emphasizing the importance of experience in both guest interactions and insect behaviors.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges existing paradigms in entomology by introducing experiential frameworks previously utilized in hospitality. The novelty lies in the application of concepts such as personalization, moments of truth, and co-creation to the study of insects, thereby redefining their interactions with ecosystems and other organisms.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of guest experience in hospitality be transposed to understand insect experiences in their ecosystems?
2. What are the critical moments of truth in insect lives that influence their survival and reproductive success?
3. How do insects personalize their interactions based on environmental cues, and what implications does this have for ecological dynamics?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Guest Experience in Hospitality**: Historical evolution from basic service provision to a focus on holistic guest experiences.
- **Entomology**: Development from descriptive taxonomy to integrative approaches incorporating genetics, ecology, and behavior.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Hospitality**: Emphasis on personalization, service quality, and sustainability practices.
- **Entomology**: Focus on taxonomy, pest control, and ecological roles, with limited exploration of insect experiences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of frameworks considering the subjective experiences of insects.
- Opportunities for innovation in entomology through the application of experiential concepts from hospitality.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Service Quality Theory**: SERVQUAL model for measuring service delivery in hospitality.
- **Behavioral Ecology**: Understanding insect behaviors in relation to environmental interactions.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Insect Experience Theory**: A framework to analyze the totality of interactions insects have within their ecosystems.
- **Personalization in Insect Behavior**: Exploring how insects tailor their behaviors based on past experiences.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that combines service quality, personalization, and co-creation principles with behavioral ecology to assess insect interactions.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore insect experiences through observational studies, experiments, and surveys.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Field Studies**: Observational studies of insect behaviors in natural habitats.
- **Surveys**: Gathering data on insect interactions with their environments.
- **Experiments**: Controlled studies to test hypotheses related to personalization and critical moments.

### Analytical Approaches
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilizing software for data analysis to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Thematic Analysis**: Analyzing qualitative data from observations and surveys for recurring themes.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring humane treatment of insects during experiments and adhering to ethical guidelines for ecological research.
