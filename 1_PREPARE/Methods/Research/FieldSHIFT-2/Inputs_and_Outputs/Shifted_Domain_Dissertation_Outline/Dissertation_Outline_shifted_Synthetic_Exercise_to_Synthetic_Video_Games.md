# PhD Dissertation Plan: Exercise into Game Design

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of exercise and game design, termed the Shifted Domain. By integrating principles of physical fitness into game mechanics, this research seeks to develop engaging gaming experiences that promote health and well-being. The significance of this work lies in its potential to transform the gaming industry, encouraging players to adopt active lifestyles while enhancing their gaming experiences. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding this fusion, presenting empirical research and practical applications that can redefine both fields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of exercise science and game design. As both fields evolve, there is an increasing recognition of the benefits of physical activity for mental health and cognitive function, alongside the growing influence of gaming in modern culture. This dissertation will investigate how principles of exercise can be effectively integrated into game design to create immersive and health-promoting experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the dual challenge of promoting physical activity in an increasingly sedentary society while revolutionizing the gaming experience. By leveraging the engaging nature of games, this dissertation proposes a framework that not only enhances player engagement but also contributes to public health initiatives. The novelty lies in the systematic exploration of how exercise principles can inform game mechanics, creating a new paradigm in both fields.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game mechanics be designed to encourage physical activity without compromising gameplay?
2. What are the psychological effects of integrating exercise into gaming experiences?
3. How does a progressive challenge system in games influence player performance and satisfaction?
