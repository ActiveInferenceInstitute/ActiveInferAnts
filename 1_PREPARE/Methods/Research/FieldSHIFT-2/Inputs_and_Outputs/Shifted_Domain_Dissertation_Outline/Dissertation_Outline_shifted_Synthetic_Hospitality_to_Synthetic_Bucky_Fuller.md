# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating principles of guest experience in hospitality with Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy. By examining the intersections between these two previously distinct domains, we seek to create a new framework for understanding and enhancing guest interactions through design science, sustainability, and systems thinking. The research will contribute to both hospitality management and design disciplines, offering innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in service delivery and operational efficiency. This exploration is poised to have significant implications for industry practices, educational curricula, and future research directions, ultimately fostering a more sustainable and adaptable hospitality landscape.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on enhancing guest experiences through service quality, personalization, and operational efficiency. Concurrently, Buckminster Fuller’s design philosophy emphasizes holistic thinking, sustainability, and innovative problem-solving for global challenges. The fusion of these two domains presents a unique opportunity to rethink how guest experiences can be designed, delivered, and sustained.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it bridges the gap between hospitality management and design science, creating a novel interdisciplinary framework that addresses current industry challenges. By applying Fuller's principles to guest experiences, we can innovate service delivery, enhance sustainability, and improve organizational adaptability.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can design science principles be applied to enhance guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What role do synergetics and tensegrity play in creating adaptive service models?
3. How can sustainability be integrated into the guest experience to promote eco-friendly practices?
