# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Guest Experience in Hospitality to Systems Thinking in Design Through the Lens of Buckminster Fuller

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of guest experience in the hospitality industry and systems thinking in design, utilizing Buckminster Fuller’s principles as a guiding framework. The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine design practices by integrating user-centered approaches and sustainability, thereby creating transformative experiences that resonate across disciplines. This work will contribute to the development of a comprehensive theoretical model and practical applications that can influence both the hospitality and design sectors, ultimately fostering a more holistic understanding of user engagement and environmental responsibility.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The hospitality industry has increasingly focused on enhancing guest experiences through personalized services and technology integration. Concurrently, systems thinking, as championed by Buckminster Fuller, emphasizes holistic approaches to design and problem-solving. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains, presenting a new paradigm for design that prioritizes user experience while addressing sustainability challenges.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its integration of principles from hospitality into design practices, challenging traditional notions of aesthetics and functionality. By applying guest experience frameworks to design, the dissertation proposes innovative methodologies that can lead to more sustainable and user-centric outcomes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of guest experience in hospitality inform systems thinking in design?
2. What are the implications of integrating user-centered design approaches into sustainable practices?
3. How can Buckminster Fuller’s theories be adapted to enhance the guest experience in design?
