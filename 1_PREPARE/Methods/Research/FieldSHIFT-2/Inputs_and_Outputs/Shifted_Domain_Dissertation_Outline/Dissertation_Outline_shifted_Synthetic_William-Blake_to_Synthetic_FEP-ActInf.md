# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing William Blake's Life and Work into the Context of the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the intersection of William Blake's artistic and spiritual insights with the principles of cognitive science, specifically the Free Energy Principle (FEP). By analyzing Blake's concepts of contraries, imagination, and spirituality through the lens of predictive coding, active inference, and generative models, this research seeks to establish a novel framework that bridges the gap between art and cognitive science. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia, offering fresh perspectives on education, therapy, and technology, ultimately enhancing human understanding and well-being.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a fusion of two distinct fields: the rich, visionary world of William Blake's poetry and art, and the scientific rigor of the Free Energy Principle, which explains how living systems maintain their integrity through predictive coding and active inference. This interdisciplinary exploration seeks to redefine cognitive processes by integrating creative and spiritual dimensions.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional boundaries between art and science, proposing that creativity and spirituality are essential components of cognitive functioning. It highlights the transformative potential of Blake's work in understanding human cognition and behavior, offering new insights into mental health, education, and technological innovation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of contraries inform our understanding of predictive coding in the brain?
2. In what ways does imagination serve as an active inference strategy in cognitive processes?
3. How do spiritual beliefs function as generative models that shape perception and decision-making?
4. What are the practical applications of these insights in educational and therapeutic contexts?
