# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating William Blake's Visionary Insights with the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking exploration of the Shifted Domain that merges William Blake's visionary artistry and philosophy with the scientific frameworks of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. By investigating the intersections of creativity, spirituality, and cognitive processes, this research aims to articulate new theoretical constructs, develop innovative methodologies, and propose practical applications that could revolutionize our understanding of human cognition. The potential impact includes advancing interdisciplinary research, informing educational practices, and contributing to mental health strategies, thereby fostering a more holistic approach to human experience.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between the realms of art and science, specifically the integration of William Blake's artistic and philosophical contributions with contemporary cognitive science. This fusion aims to explore how imaginative processes can inform and enhance our understanding of cognitive frameworks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the traditional boundaries between art and science, proposing that imagination and spirituality play critical roles in cognitive processes. The novelty lies in the application of Blake's philosophies to contemporary cognitive science, particularly in understanding consciousness, creativity, and adaptive behavior.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's concepts of imagination and contraries be integrated into the Free Energy Principle?
2. What new theoretical frameworks emerge from this integration that better explain human cognition?
3. How can these insights inform practical applications in education, mental health, and technology?
