By analyzing the intersection of these two domains, the research will provide a comprehensive framework for enhancing guest experiences through cultural immersion, emotional engagement, and holistic well-being. The significance of this study lies in its potential to redefine hospitality practices, promote interdisciplinary collaboration, and foster cultural understanding. The dissertation will contribute to both academic literature and practical applications in the hospitality industry, ultimately creating a more enriching and meaningful experience for guests.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality industry has traditionally focused on service quality and customer satisfaction, emphasizing the tangible aspects of the guest experience. Meanwhile, non-science ways of knowing encompass intuitive, cultural, and experiential knowledge systems that challenge the dominance of scientific reasoning. This dissertation seeks to merge these two domains, exploring how non-scientific insights can enhance the guest experience and create a more holistic approach to hospitality.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it addresses a gap in the hospitality literature by integrating non-scientific perspectives into guest experience design. The novelty lies in the proposed frameworks and methodologies that draw from cultural traditions, emotional intelligence, and narrative engagement, leading to innovative hospitality practices that resonate with diverse guest populations.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can non-science ways of knowing enhance the guest experience in hospitality?
2. What frameworks can be developed to integrate cultural immersion and emotional engagement into hospitality practices?
3. How do these integrations impact guest satisfaction, loyalty, and overall well-being?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

The evolution of the hospitality industry has transitioned from basic service provision to a focus on creating memorable experiences. Concurrently, non-science ways of knowing have developed through oral traditions and cultural practices, often in opposition to scientific rationalism.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

In hospitality, current trends emphasize personalization, sustainability, and technology. Non-science ways of knowing highlight the importance of subjective experiences, narratives, and cultural beliefs. However, there is limited research on how these two domains can intersect.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a significant gap in understanding how non-scientific methodologies can be applied to enhance guest experiences. This dissertation will explore these opportunities, proposing a framework that integrates both domains to create innovative hospitality practices.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

1. **Service Quality Theory**: Focuses on the dimensions of service quality in hospitality.
2. **Cultural Theory**: Explores the role of culture in shaping experiences and perceptions.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

1. **Cultural Immersion Model**: Integrates cultural practices into the guest experience.
2. **Holistic Guest Well-Being Framework**: Emphasizes the interconnectedness of physical, emotional, and cultural aspects of guest satisfaction.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will be developed that combines service quality dimensions with non-science ways of knowing, emphasizing personalization, emotional engagement, and cultural relevance.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into hospitality practices.

## Data Collection Methods

1. **Surveys**: Assess guest satisfaction and preferences regarding cultural experiences.
2. **Interviews**: Gather insights from hospitality professionals and cultural experts.
3. **Case Studies**: Analyze successful implementations of cultural immersion in hospitality settings.

## Analytical Approaches

1. **Statistical Analysis**: Evaluate survey data to identify trends and correlations.
2. **Thematic Analysis**: Analyze qualitative data from interviews and case studies to identify key themes.

## Ethical Considerations

Ensure informed consent from participants, maintain confidentiality, and respect cultural sensitivities in research practices.
