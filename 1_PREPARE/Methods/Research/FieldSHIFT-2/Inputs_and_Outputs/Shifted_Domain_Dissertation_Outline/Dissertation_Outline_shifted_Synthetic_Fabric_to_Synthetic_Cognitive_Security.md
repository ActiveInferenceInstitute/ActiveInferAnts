# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing the Fabric Industry and Arts into Cognitive Security

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of the fabric industry and arts (Domain A) with cognitive security (Domain B). By examining the creative and structural parallels between textile design and information integrity, this research seeks to develop new frameworks, theories, and methodologies that enhance cognitive security against misinformation and manipulation. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academia into practical applications in media, policy-making, and community resilience, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and ethical information ecosystem.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fabric industry has long been a realm of creativity, cultural expression, and sustainability, while cognitive security has emerged as a critical field focused on protecting individuals and societies from misinformation and cognitive manipulation. This dissertation will investigate how principles from the fabric industry can inform and transform cognitive security practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct fields, offering a novel perspective on cognitive security through the lens of textile arts. By integrating methodologies and concepts from textile design, this work aims to create innovative solutions to contemporary challenges in cognitive security, promoting ethical information dissemination and cultural resilience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of textile design be applied to enhance cognitive security frameworks?
2. What new theoretical constructs emerge from the intersection of these domains?
3. How can sustainable practices in the fabric industry inform ethical information dissemination in cognitive security?

## Literature Review
