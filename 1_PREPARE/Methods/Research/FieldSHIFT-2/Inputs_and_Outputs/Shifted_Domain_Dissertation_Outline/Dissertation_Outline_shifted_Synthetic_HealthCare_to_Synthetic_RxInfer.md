# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Health Care Principles to RxInfer.jl

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of health care principles with the probabilistic programming framework of RxInfer.jl. By integrating patient-centered care, service quality metrics, and continuity of care from health care into the domain of probabilistic programming, this research seeks to create a user-centered inference model that enhances the interpretability and applicability of complex probabilistic models. The significance of this research lies in its potential to transform how probabilistic programming is approached, making it more accessible to non-experts and improving user engagement, which could lead to better model outcomes and broader real-world applications. This dissertation will provide a roadmap for future research and practical applications in both fields.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a convergence of health care principles and probabilistic programming. Health care has evolved towards a more patient-centered model, emphasizing user experience and continuous improvement based on feedback. Conversely, RxInfer.jl focuses on efficient inference in complex probabilistic models, often lacking in user engagement. This dissertation aims to transpose the core principles of health care into the domain of probabilistic programming to enhance user experience and model effectiveness.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to integrating health care principles into a technical field, creating a user-centered inference paradigm. By doing so, it addresses existing gaps in user engagement and model interpretability in probabilistic programming, potentially revolutionizing both fields through interdisciplinary insights.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can health care principles be effectively integrated into probabilistic programming frameworks?
2. What are the impacts of user engagement on model accuracy and interpretability?
3. How can the quality of inference in RxInfer.jl be measured and improved through user-centered approaches?
