# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformational Negotiation: A Chemical Perspective

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of chemical reactions and negotiation, proposing a transformative framework that leverages principles from chemistry to enhance negotiation processes. By identifying isomorphisms between the two domains, this research aims to develop novel theories, methodologies, and practical applications that can significantly impact both fields. The findings are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of negotiation dynamics, offering strategies that can lead to more effective conflict resolution and relationship management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of chemical reactions and negotiation strategies. Chemical reactions, characterized by the transformation of reactants into products, provide a rich metaphor for negotiation processes, where parties transform their positions through dialogue. This study seeks to bridge the gap between the scientific rigor of chemistry and the art of negotiation.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces a unique perspective on negotiation, framing it through the lens of chemical principles. The novelty lies in the systematic application of concepts such as catalysis, equilibrium, and kinetics to enhance negotiation outcomes, thereby creating a new lexicon and theoretical constructs that can redefine negotiation practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles from chemical reactions inform and enhance negotiation strategies?
2. What are the implications of viewing negotiation as a transformational process akin to chemical transformations?
3. How can new theoretical frameworks and practical applications be developed from this interdisciplinary approach?
