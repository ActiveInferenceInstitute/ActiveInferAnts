# PhD Dissertation Plan: Applying Chemistry Concepts to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of chemistry and negotiation, proposing a transformative framework that applies chemical principles to enhance negotiation strategies and outcomes. By leveraging foundational concepts from chemistry—such as chemical reactions, catalysis, and equilibrium—this research seeks to develop a comprehensive model that not only enriches negotiation theory but also offers practical applications in various fields. The anticipated impact includes improved negotiation practices across industries, enhanced conflict resolution strategies, and the potential to establish new interdisciplinary subfields.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of chemistry and negotiation represents a novel approach to understanding and improving negotiation processes. While chemistry provides a robust framework for analyzing interactions and transformations, negotiation studies traditionally focus on communication, psychology, and strategy. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, offering insights that can lead to more effective negotiation practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize negotiation strategies by applying scientific rigor. The novelty stems from the interdisciplinary approach that incorporates chemical principles into negotiation theory, creating a new paradigm that enhances both understanding and practice in negotiation.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can principles of chemistry be applied to model negotiation processes?
2. What are the implications of viewing negotiation as a chemical reaction for understanding negotiation dynamics?
3. How can this interdisciplinary framework improve negotiation outcomes across various contexts?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Chemistry:** Overview of the evolution from alchemy to modern chemistry, highlighting key milestones and current trends.
- **Negotiation:** Examination of the development of negotiation theory, including major contributions from psychology, sociology, and communication studies.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Chemistry:** Discussion of contemporary research in sustainable chemistry, molecular interactions, and reaction mechanisms.
- **Negotiation:** Analysis of current paradigms, challenges, and strategies in negotiation, including conflict resolution and emotional intelligence.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
Identifying the lack of interdisciplinary approaches in negotiation studies and the potential for innovative frameworks that incorporate scientific principles.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Chemical Reaction Theory:** Understanding reactants, products, and transformation processes.
- **Negotiation Theory:** Key concepts in negotiation, including interests, positions, and strategies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Negotiation as a Chemical Reaction:** Viewing negotiation processes through the lens of chemical interactions.
- **Catalytic Facilitation in Negotiation:** The role of facilitators as catalysts in the negotiation process.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
Development of a comprehensive model that synthesizes chemical principles with negotiation strategies, outlining how these concepts interact and influence outcomes.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative case studies and quantitative surveys to analyze negotiation outcomes influenced by chemical principles.

### Data Collection Methods
- **Case Studies:** In-depth analysis of negotiations in various contexts (business, diplomacy, personal).
- **Surveys:** Quantitative assessments of negotiators' perceptions of satisfaction, balance, and effectiveness.

### Analytical Approaches
Utilization of statistical analysis to correlate negotiation outcomes with the application of chemical principles, alongside thematic analysis of qualitative data.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring confidentiality and informed consent in participant involvement, particularly in sensitive negotiation contexts.
