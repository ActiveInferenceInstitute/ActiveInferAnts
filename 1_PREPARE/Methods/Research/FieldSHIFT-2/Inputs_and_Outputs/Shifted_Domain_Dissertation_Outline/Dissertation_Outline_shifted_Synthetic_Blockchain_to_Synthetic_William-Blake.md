# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Technology into the Context of William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of blockchain technology and the artistic and philosophical contributions of William Blake. By reimagining Blake's work through the lens of blockchain principles, this research seeks to uncover transformative insights that highlight the relevance of Blake's ideas in today's digital landscape. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how decentralization, transparency, immutability, and smart contracts can revolutionize the art world, democratize artistic expression, and preserve the legacy of visionary artists like Blake. The potential impact of this research extends beyond academia, with implications for artists, technologists, and society at large.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents the confluence of blockchain technology, characterized by decentralization and transparency, and the artistic vision of William Blake, known for his exploration of duality and spirituality. This unique intersection allows for a nuanced understanding of both fields, revealing new pathways for artistic expression and engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it bridges two previously distinct domains, offering a fresh perspective on Blake's work while simultaneously exploring the transformative potential of blockchain in the art world. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of blockchain principles into the context of Blake's artistic philosophy, creating a new framework for understanding both.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
