# Comprehensive PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Blockchain Technology into the Context of William Blake’s Life and Work

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of blockchain technology and the life and work of William Blake, proposing a transformative framework that redefines artistic expression, ownership, and community engagement. By integrating these two distinct domains, the research aims to unlock new potentials for creative collaboration, challenge traditional paradigms of authorship, and enhance the preservation and appreciation of Blake's contributions. The findings will not only contribute to the fields of art history and technology but also provide a roadmap for future interdisciplinary research and practical applications in the arts.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of blockchain technology—a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for recording transactions—and the multifaceted artistic and philosophical legacy of William Blake presents a unique opportunity to rethink how art is created, shared, and valued. This shift invites an exploration of new methodologies in art criticism, curation, and community engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it proposes an entirely new lens through which to view Blake's work, contextualizing it within contemporary technological paradigms. The novelty lies in the application of blockchain principles to Blake's artistic philosophy, challenging existing interpretations and opening pathways for innovative artistic practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can blockchain technology reinterpret the ownership and distribution of Blake's art?
- In what ways does Blake's philosophy align with the principles of decentralization and community in blockchain?
- What new artistic frameworks can emerge from the integration of these two domains?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Blockchain**: Overview of the evolution from Bitcoin to smart contracts and decentralized applications.
- **William Blake**: Examination of Blake’s life, his artistic innovations, and the historical context of his work.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
