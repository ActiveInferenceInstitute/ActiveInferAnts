# PhD Dissertation Plan: Game Design Principles Applied to Negotiation

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the transformative potential of integrating game design principles into negotiation practices. By examining the intersection of these two fields, the research aims to develop innovative frameworks and methodologies that enhance negotiation efficacy and engagement. The significance of this study lies in its capacity to redefine traditional negotiation strategies, promote collaborative approaches, and foster emotional intelligence in negotiators. The potential impact extends beyond academia into practical applications in various sectors, including business, diplomacy, and conflict resolution.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of game design and negotiation represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that leverages the engaging mechanics of games to enhance the often-stressful and adversarial nature of negotiation. Game design principles, such as player agency, feedback loops, and narrative integration, can be systematically applied to create more dynamic and effective negotiation strategies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the limitations of traditional negotiation models, which often overlook the importance of emotional engagement and adaptability. By applying game design principles, this study introduces a fresh perspective that emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and continuous improvement in negotiation practices.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can game design principles be effectively integrated into negotiation training and practice?
2. What are the potential benefits of gamifying negotiation processes for diverse stakeholders?
3. How can emotional engagement and feedback mechanisms enhance negotiation outcomes?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
- **Game Design**: The evolution from simple arcade games to complex, narrative-driven experiences.
- **Negotiation**: The transition from informal agreements to structured processes in various fields, emphasizing ethics and relationship management.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
- **Game Design**: Current trends include the rise of indie games, live-service models, and community engagement.
- **Negotiation**: Emphasis on ethical practices, emotional intelligence, and the impact of cultural differences.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
- Lack of integration between game design and negotiation.
- Opportunities for innovation in training methodologies and negotiation frameworks.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Game Design Theories**: MDA (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics) model.
- **Negotiation Theories**: Interest-based negotiation, integrative bargaining.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- Theoretical constructs that bridge game design and negotiation, focusing on engagement, adaptability, and emotional intelligence.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
An integrated model that synthesizes game design principles with negotiation strategies, highlighting the interplay between mechanics, dynamics, and emotional engagement.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative research to explore the application of game design in negotiation.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with negotiation experts and game designers.
- Case studies of gamified negotiation training programs.

### Analytical Approaches
- Statistical analysis of survey data.
- Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews.

### Ethical Considerations
Ensuring informed consent, confidentiality, and the ethical treatment of participants in research.
