# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Python Programming Language into Non-Science Ways of Knowing

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of Python programming and non-science ways of knowing, proposing a transformative framework that integrates technical and cultural knowledge systems. By examining the principles of Python—such as readability, versatility, and community engagement—and juxtaposing them with diverse non-scientific methodologies, this research seeks to create new pedagogical approaches, develop novel programming paradigms, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The potential impact of this work lies in its ability to democratize knowledge creation, enhance educational practices, and cultivate a more inclusive understanding of technology's role in society.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking fusion of Python programming and non-science ways of knowing, encompassing intuitive, experiential, and cultural methodologies. This intersection challenges traditional paradigms and opens new avenues for understanding and applying knowledge.
