# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift from William Blake's Life and Work to RxInfer.jl

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of William Blake's artistic philosophy and the probabilistic programming capabilities of RxInfer.jl. By integrating the spiritual and emotional dimensions of Blake’s work with the analytical rigor of probabilistic modeling, this research aims to develop a new framework for understanding uncertainty in complex systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize both the fields of art and data science, offering a holistic approach that values creativity and subjectivity. The impact of this research extends beyond academia, influencing industry practices, educational paradigms, and societal understanding of human behavior.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain combines the mystical and visionary aspects of William Blake's life and work with the technical framework of RxInfer.jl, a tool for probabilistic programming. This synthesis seeks to address the limitations of traditional probabilistic models by infusing them with artistic insights and subjective experiences.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it challenges the conventional binary of art versus science, promoting an interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the value of emotional depth and creativity in quantitative modeling. The novelty lies in the application of Blake’s concepts of "contraries" and visionary experiences to enhance the interpretability and relevance of probabilistic models.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can Blake's artistic principles inform the development of probabilistic models in RxInfer.jl?
2. What new frameworks can be created to integrate subjective experiences into probabilistic reasoning?
3. In what ways can this integration transform educational practices and industry applications?
