## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of William Blake's artistic vision with game design creates a unique domain that transcends traditional boundaries. Blake's exploration of imagination, dualities, and social critique can inform and enhance game mechanics, narrative depth, and player engagement. This dissertation seeks to articulate how these elements can be effectively integrated into game design, offering a fresh perspective on both artistic expression and interactive media.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant for its interdisciplinary approach, bridging literature, art, and digital media. The novelty lies in the application of Blake's philosophical constructs to develop innovative game design methodologies that prioritize narrative depth and player engagement. By examining the interplay between Blake's themes and game mechanics, the dissertation aims to establish a new paradigm for understanding and creating games.
