# Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the innovative transposition of guest experience principles from the hospitality industry to the logistics sector. By synthesizing concepts from both domains, this research will develop a comprehensive framework termed "Logistics Experience" (LX), which emphasizes the importance of personalization, technology integration, and employee engagement in enhancing customer satisfaction. The findings have the potential to revolutionize logistics operations, leading to improved service quality, operational efficiency, and customer loyalty, while also setting the groundwork for interdisciplinary collaborations and future research directions.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain focuses on the intersection of guest experience from hospitality and operational logistics. Historically, these two fields have operated independently; however, the increasing demand for personalized services and customer-centric approaches in logistics has created an opportunity for cross-pollination of ideas and practices. 

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant as it challenges traditional logistics paradigms by introducing a guest experience lens, which has been successfully implemented in hospitality. The novelty lies in the systematic adaptation of service-oriented principles to logistics, thereby creating a new paradigm that prioritizes customer satisfaction and engagement.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can guest experience principles be effectively transposed to enhance logistics services?
2. What frameworks can be developed to measure and optimize the logistics experience?
3. How do personalized logistics solutions impact customer satisfaction and loyalty?
