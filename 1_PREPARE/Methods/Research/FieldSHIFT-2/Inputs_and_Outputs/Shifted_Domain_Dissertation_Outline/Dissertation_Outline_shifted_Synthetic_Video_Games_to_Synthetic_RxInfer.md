# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of game design principles with probabilistic programming through the lens of RxInfer.jl, a tool for Bayesian inference. By transposing key elements of game design—such as player engagement, iterative design, and narrative integration—into the realm of probabilistic modeling, this research aims to enhance user experience, accessibility, and understanding of complex statistical concepts. The potential impact of this work extends beyond academic contributions; it offers transformative applications in education, industry, and societal decision-making. This dissertation lays out a comprehensive roadmap for a doctoral candidate to investigate this Shifted Domain, ultimately contributing to the evolution of both fields.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a groundbreaking integration of game design and probabilistic programming. Game design emphasizes user engagement and experience, while probabilistic programming focuses on modeling uncertainty and complex systems. By merging these domains, this research seeks to create tools that are not only functional but also enjoyable and intuitive for users.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it addresses the often-overlooked user experience in probabilistic programming, a field that can be intimidating for non-experts. By applying game design principles, we can democratize access to complex modeling techniques, fostering a deeper understanding and broader application of Bayesian inference. The novelty lies in the application of established game design methodologies to a traditionally rigid field, opening new avenues for innovation and engagement.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can game design principles enhance user engagement in probabilistic programming?
2. What iterative design processes can be implemented in RxInfer.jl to improve model building and user satisfaction?
3. In what ways can narrative elements be integrated into the learning process of probabilistic modeling to enhance understanding?
