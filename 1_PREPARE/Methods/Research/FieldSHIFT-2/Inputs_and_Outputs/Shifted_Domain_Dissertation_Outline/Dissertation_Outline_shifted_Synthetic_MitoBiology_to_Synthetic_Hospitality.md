# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Mitochondrial Biology to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By drawing parallels between mitochondrial functions and guest interactions, the research seeks to develop new theoretical constructs and practical applications that enhance guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The proposed framework—integrating concepts such as "experience energy," dynamic service models, and experience biogenesis—has the potential to revolutionize hospitality management, foster guest loyalty, and create sustainable business practices. This work invites interdisciplinary collaboration and contributes to the academic discourse on experiential service delivery.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of mitochondrial biology and hospitality guest experience represents a novel approach to understanding and improving service delivery. Mitochondria, known as the powerhouses of the cell, are crucial for energy production and cellular health. Similarly, guest experience serves as the lifeblood of the hospitality industry, driving satisfaction and loyalty.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it introduces biological principles to hospitality management, offering fresh insights into guest engagement and operational strategies. The novelty lies in the transposition of biological concepts into a service-oriented framework, which has not been previously explored.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can mitochondrial principles be applied to enhance guest experience in hospitality?
2. What is the relationship between "experience energy" and guest loyalty?
3. In what ways can dynamic service models improve operational efficiency and guest satisfaction?
