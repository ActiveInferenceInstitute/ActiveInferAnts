## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of mitochondrial biology and guest experience in the hospitality industry. By transposing core principles from the functioning of mitochondria—such as energy production, dynamic adaptability, and co-creation—this research aims to redefine how hospitality businesses approach guest interactions. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize service delivery, enhance guest satisfaction, and foster brand loyalty. Through a comprehensive analysis, the dissertation will present a novel theoretical framework, empirical studies, and practical applications that can transform the hospitality sector.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The mitochondrion, often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell, is crucial for energy production and various cellular functions. In contrast, the guest experience encompasses every interaction a customer has with a hospitality establishment. This dissertation proposes a novel approach that draws parallels between these two domains, suggesting that principles from mitochondrial biology can inform and enhance the guest experience in hospitality.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on guest experience management by integrating biological principles. It highlights the importance of energy dynamics in service delivery and emphasizes the role of adaptability and co-creation in enhancing guest satisfaction. This interdisciplinary approach opens up new avenues for research and practice in both hospitality and biological sciences.
