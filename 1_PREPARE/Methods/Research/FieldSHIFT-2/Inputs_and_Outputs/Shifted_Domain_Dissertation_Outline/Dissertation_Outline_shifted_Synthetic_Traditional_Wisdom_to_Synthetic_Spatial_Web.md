# PhD Dissertation Plan: Integrating Traditional Knowledge with the Spatial Web

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Traditional Knowledge (TK) with the emerging Spatial Web paradigm. By examining the synergies between these two domains, the research seeks to develop innovative frameworks and applications that enhance community engagement, ecological sustainability, and cultural relevance in urban environments. The study will provide a comprehensive analysis of how TK can inform smart city planning, augmented reality (AR) applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for environmental monitoring. The findings are expected to contribute significantly to the fields of urban studies, environmental science, and cultural anthropology, while also offering practical implications for policy-making and community development.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection of Traditional Knowledge and the Spatial Web, characterized by a seamless integration of cultural insights and digital technologies. Traditional Knowledge encompasses the practices, beliefs, and ecological wisdom of indigenous and local communities, while the Spatial Web refers to the interconnected digital and physical environments facilitated by advanced technologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it addresses the urgent need for sustainable urban development that respects and incorporates local cultural practices. The novelty lies in the systematic transposition of TK into Spatial Web applications, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can Traditional Knowledge enhance the resilience and sustainability of smart city frameworks?
- In what ways can AR applications be designed to visualize and promote local cultural practices?
- What methodologies can be developed to incorporate TK into AI models for environmental monitoring?
