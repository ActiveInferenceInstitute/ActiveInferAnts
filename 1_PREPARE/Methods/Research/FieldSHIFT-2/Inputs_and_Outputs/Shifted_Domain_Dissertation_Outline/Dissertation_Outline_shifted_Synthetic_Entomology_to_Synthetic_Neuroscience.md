# PhD Dissertation Plan: Neuroentomology - Bridging Entomology and Neuroscience

## Executive Summary
This dissertation explores the innovative intersection of entomology and neuroscience, termed "neuroentomology." By examining the parallels between insect behaviors and neural processes, this research aims to uncover transformative insights into cognitive functions and social interactions. The significance of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize our understanding of neural plasticity, communication, and collective behavior, with far-reaching implications for both fields and broader societal applications. The dissertation will provide a comprehensive analysis, propose new theoretical models, and outline practical applications and future research directions.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of entomology and neuroscience represents a novel academic endeavor that seeks to leverage the adaptive strategies of insects to inform our understanding of neural mechanisms. Insects, with their complex social structures and remarkable adaptability, provide a unique lens through which to examine cognitive processes.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant due to its interdisciplinary nature, offering fresh perspectives on neural networks and social behavior. By integrating insights from entomology into neuroscience, the study aims to bridge gaps in understanding how complex systems adapt and function.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of metamorphosis in insects inform our understanding of neural plasticity in the brain?
2. In what ways do chemical communication mechanisms in insect societies parallel neurotransmitter signaling in neural networks?
3. What insights can the social structures of insects provide for models of collective cognition and decision-making in humans?
