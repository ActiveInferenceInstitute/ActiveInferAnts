# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between Health Care and Cuisine, two fields traditionally viewed as distinct. Health Care emphasizes patient-centered practices, quality service, and technology integration, while Cuisine focuses on cultural expression, flavor profiles, and sensory experiences. This dissertation will explore how principles from Health Care can inform and enhance culinary practices, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and dining experiences.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to redefine culinary practices by incorporating health-focused methodologies. This novel approach can lead to personalized dining experiences that cater to individual health needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds. By recognizing the importance of the dining environment and sustainability in both fields, this research offers a fresh perspective that can foster community well-being and individual satisfaction.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can patient-centered care principles be applied to culinary practices to enhance individual health outcomes?
2. What role does technology play in bridging the gap between Health Care and Cuisine?
3. How can the dining environment be optimized to improve both the culinary experience and health benefits for individuals?
4. What sustainable practices can be adopted in cuisine to align with health-focused initiatives?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

A comprehensive overview of the evolution of Health Care and Cuisine will be presented, highlighting key milestones, practices, and philosophies that have shaped each field. The historical significance of patient-centered care in Health Care will be contrasted with the cultural evolution of Cuisine, focusing on traditional practices and modern adaptations.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

An analysis of contemporary research in both Health Care and Cuisine will be conducted, identifying prevailing theories, methodologies, and practices. This section will examine the current understanding of patient experience in healthcare and the importance of sensory perception in culinary experiences.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

This section will identify gaps in the literature regarding the integration of Health Care principles into culinary practices. Opportunities for interdisciplinary research will be highlighted, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches that address health and wellness through food.

# Theoretical Framework

## Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The dissertation will draw upon key theories from both Health Care (e.g., patient-centered care, quality assurance) and Cuisine (e.g., sensory perception, cultural identity) to establish a robust theoretical foundation for the Shifted Domain.

## New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

New constructs, such as the Culinary Health Model and Flavor Therapy, will be introduced to encapsulate the unique dynamics of the Shifted Domain. These constructs will serve as guiding frameworks for the research.

## Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model will be developed to illustrate the relationships between health, cuisine, and technology, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these elements interact within the Shifted Domain.

# Methodology

## Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods research design will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to gather comprehensive data on the integration of Health Care and Cuisine.

## Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and case studies involving healthcare providers, culinary professionals, and consumers. Additionally, observational studies in dining environments will be conducted.

## Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis will be utilized to examine quantitative data, while thematic analysis will be applied to qualitative data to identify emerging patterns and insights.

## Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be addressed, including informed consent, confidentiality, and the potential impact of research findings on participants and communities.
