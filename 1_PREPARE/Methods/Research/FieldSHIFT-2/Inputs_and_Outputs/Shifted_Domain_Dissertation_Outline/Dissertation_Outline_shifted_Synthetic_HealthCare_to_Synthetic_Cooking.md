# Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of health care principles with culinary practices, a Shifted Domain that emphasizes the transformative potential of personalized dining experiences. By applying concepts from health care—such as patient-centered care, service quality, and continuous improvement—this research aims to enhance the dining experience, promote public health, and address contemporary challenges in cuisine. The findings will not only contribute to academic discourse but also provide practical applications for the culinary industry, health organizations, and policy-makers, ultimately fostering a holistic approach to well-being through food.

# Introduction

## Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain of transposing health care principles into the context of cuisine represents a novel interdisciplinary approach that seeks to bridge the gap between two traditionally distinct fields. Health care emphasizes patient well-being, personalized care, and quality service, while cuisine focuses on flavor, cultural significance, and nutritional content. This dissertation will investigate how these domains can inform and enhance one another, creating an innovative framework for improving dining experiences and public health outcomes.

## Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize both health care and culinary practices. By integrating health care principles into cuisine, we can create a new paradigm that prioritizes the diner experience, encourages healthier eating habits, and fosters sustainable practices in food preparation. This research is novel in that it applies established health care methodologies to the culinary world, paving the way for future interdisciplinary studies and collaborations.

## Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can health care principles be effectively integrated into culinary practices to enhance the dining experience?
2. What impact does personalized dining have on customer satisfaction and public health outcomes?
3. In what ways can this interdisciplinary approach lead to sustainable practices within the culinary industry?

# Literature Review

## Historical Context of the Original Domains

### Health Care
The evolution of health care from a paternalistic model to a collaborative, patient-centered approach has transformed how services are delivered. Key milestones include the rise of evidence-based practices, the incorporation of technology, and a growing emphasis on preventive care.

### Cuisine
Cuisine has developed through cultural and historical contexts, with traditional practices often rooted in geography and societal norms. The challenges of globalization and health-related issues have prompted a reevaluation of culinary practices and their impact on health.

## Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

### Health Care
Current trends in health care emphasize technology integration, mental health, and community health initiatives. The focus on patient experience and service quality continues to shape how health care providers engage with patients.

### Cuisine
The culinary field is increasingly addressing issues such as food waste, dietary restrictions, and the health implications of food choices. Innovations in sustainable cooking practices and health-focused ingredients are emerging as critical areas of exploration.

## Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there remains a lack of interdisciplinary research that connects health care principles with culinary practices. This gap presents an opportunity to explore how the two domains can inform one another, leading to improved dining experiences and public health outcomes.
