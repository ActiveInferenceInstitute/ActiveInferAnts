The proposed research agenda will lay the groundwork for future studies, collaborations, and the development of new educational curricula in financial services.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The financial services industry is undergoing a significant transformation due to technological advancements and changing consumer expectations. Traditional banking models, reliant on in-person interactions and physical branches, are increasingly challenged by the rise of digital banking. Simultaneously, ATM transactions exemplify a successful model of self-service banking, characterized by security, efficiency, and accessibility. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two domains by transposing ATM principles into the financial services landscape.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is novel in its approach to leveraging established ATM transaction principles to address current challenges in financial services. By focusing on user-centric design and security protocols, the study aims to create innovative solutions that enhance the digital banking experience and promote financial inclusion for underserved populations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can ATM transaction principles be effectively integrated into digital banking platforms?
2. What impact do these integrations have on user experience, security, and financial inclusion?
3. What new theoretical constructs emerge from this transposition, and how can they inform future research and practice?
