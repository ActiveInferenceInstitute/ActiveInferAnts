# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Ecosystem Principles into Population Dynamics

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative fusion of ecological principles with population dynamics, creating a Shifted Domain that offers new insights into how interconnectedness, biodiversity, and resource dynamics shape population health. By examining the parallels between ecosystems and populations, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of population resilience and stability in the face of environmental challenges. The findings have the potential to transform both ecological and population biology, leading to new interdisciplinary approaches and practical applications in conservation and resource management.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain emerges from the intersection of two traditionally distinct fields: Ecosystem Science and Population Biology. Ecosystems are characterized by the interactions between organisms and their environment, while population dynamics focus on the statistical and biological factors affecting population sizes. This dissertation will investigate how principles from ecosystem science can inform and reshape our understanding of population dynamics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The significance of this research lies in its potential to bridge gaps between ecology and population biology, offering a holistic perspective on biological systems. The novelty of this approach is underscored by the integration of concepts like interconnectedness and biodiversity into the study of populations, which has been largely overlooked in conventional population studies.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of interconnectedness and biodiversity in ecosystems inform our understanding of population dynamics?
2. What is the role of genetic diversity in enhancing population resilience to environmental stressors?
3. How do resource allocation patterns within populations influence growth and stability?
