# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Domain Shift - Integrating Non-Science Ways of Knowing into Exercise Science

## Executive Summary

This dissertation aims to explore the integration of non-science ways of knowing into the field of exercise science, proposing a transformative framework that enhances understanding of human health and well-being. By examining the interplay between subjective experience, cultural context, and holistic approaches, this research seeks to address the limitations of traditional exercise science paradigms, which often prioritize empirical data over personal narratives and cultural relevance. The potential impact of this work extends to redefining exercise practices, informing policy, and fostering community engagement, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and effective approach to physical activity.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between two previously distinct fields: non-science ways of knowing and exercise science. Non-science ways of knowing encompass subjective, cultural, and holistic methodologies that have historically been marginalized in favor of empirical scientific methods. In contrast, exercise science focuses on measurable outcomes and physiological aspects of physical activity. This dissertation seeks to bridge these domains, recognizing the value of integrating diverse perspectives to enhance understanding and engagement in exercise practices.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant for its potential to revolutionize exercise science by incorporating non-science perspectives, which can lead to more holistic and culturally relevant approaches to physical activity. The novelty lies in developing a theoretical framework that values subjective experience and cultural context, ultimately addressing the limitations of reductionist methodologies in exercise science.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

- How can non-science ways of knowing be effectively integrated into exercise science?
- What are the implications of this integration for understanding motivation, adherence, and well-being in physical activity?
- What new theoretical models and practical applications can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
