# PhD Dissertation Plan: Redefining ATM Transactions through the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating concepts from ATM transactions with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Active Inference. By proposing a novel framework that reimagines the operational and experiential aspects of ATMs, this research seeks to enhance user experience, optimize transaction efficiency, and improve security protocols. The findings will not only contribute to the fields of financial technology and behavioral science but also pave the way for innovative applications in adaptive technologies across various domains.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents an innovative intersection between traditional ATM transaction systems and advanced theories from cognitive science and machine learning. ATMs have evolved significantly over the years, yet their operational frameworks remain largely static. By applying the principles of FEP and Active Inference, this research seeks to create adaptive systems that learn from user interactions, thereby enhancing functionality and user satisfaction.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it offers a fresh perspective on how ATMs can evolve from basic transactional machines to intelligent systems capable of anticipating user needs and adapting to their behaviors. The novelty lies in the application of cognitive and computational theories to a practical domain, creating a bridge between technology and human behavior.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can the principles of the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference be applied to enhance ATM transactions?
2. What are the implications of predictive coding for user experience in financial transactions?
3. How can adaptive security measures improve the integrity of ATM transactions?
