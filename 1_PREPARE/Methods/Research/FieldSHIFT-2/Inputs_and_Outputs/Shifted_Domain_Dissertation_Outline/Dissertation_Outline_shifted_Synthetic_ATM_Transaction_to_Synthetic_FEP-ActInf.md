# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transformative Framework for ATM Transactions through the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary
This dissertation will explore the innovative integration of principles from ATM transactions and the Free Energy Principle (FEP). By reimagining ATM operations through the lens of FEP, the research aims to enhance operational efficiency, user experience, and security within ATM networks. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize financial technology, offering insights that extend beyond traditional banking systems into adaptive systems more broadly. This research will not only fill existing gaps in both domains but will also propose a novel theoretical framework and practical applications that can inform future developments in financial services.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain merges the operational aspects of ATM transactions with the theoretical constructs of the Free Energy Principle, which posits that living systems strive to minimize variational free energy. This combination allows for a deeper understanding of how ATMs can adapt to user behavior and environmental changes, optimizing their functionality and security.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between financial technology and cognitive science. By applying FEP to ATM transactions, this dissertation aims to create a new paradigm that enhances user interaction, security measures, and operational efficiency.
