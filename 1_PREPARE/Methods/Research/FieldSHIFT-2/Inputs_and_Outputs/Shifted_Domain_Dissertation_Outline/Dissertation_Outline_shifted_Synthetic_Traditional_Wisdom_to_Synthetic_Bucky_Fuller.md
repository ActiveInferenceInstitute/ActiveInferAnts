# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Traditional Knowledge into the Context of Buckminster Fuller’s Philosophy

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of traditional knowledge and Buckminster Fuller’s philosophy, proposing a new paradigm of eco-design that integrates ecological wisdom with modern architectural practices. By examining the holistic approaches of both domains, this research seeks to create a framework that emphasizes sustainability, community engagement, and cultural heritage. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize architectural design, enhance community resilience, and foster a deeper understanding of our interconnected ecological systems. The findings are expected to have substantial implications for academia, industry, and policy, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of traditional knowledge and Fuller’s philosophy offers a unique lens through which to address contemporary environmental challenges. Traditional knowledge encompasses sustainable practices rooted in cultural and ecological contexts, while Fuller’s work emphasizes innovative design and global stewardship. This dissertation seeks to articulate the synergies between these two domains, highlighting their shared commitment to sustainability and holistic understanding.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it not only bridges two previously distinct fields but also creates a new framework for sustainable design that honors cultural practices. The novelty lies in the application of traditional ecological knowledge within modern architectural contexts, proposing a model that is both innovative and respectful of heritage.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can traditional ecological knowledge inform modern sustainable architectural practices?
2. In what ways can Buckminster Fuller’s design principles be enhanced by integrating traditional knowledge?
3. What new models of community resilience can emerge from this interdisciplinary approach?
