# PhD Dissertation Plan: Transposing Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) into Non-Science Ways of Knowing (NSWK)

## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the transformative potential of integrating Prediction Matter Expertise (PME) with Non-Science Ways of Knowing (NSWK). By examining the synergies between these two domains, the research will establish a framework that validates and incorporates both empirical and intuitive knowledge systems. The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize decision-making processes across diverse fields, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhance societal resilience in addressing complex challenges. The findings will contribute to academic discourse, inform policy-making, and inspire innovative practices that respect cultural diversity and holistic understanding.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain represents a novel intersection between PME, which emphasizes data-driven predictions and cross-disciplinary synthesis, and NSWK, which values intuitive, cultural, and experiential forms of knowledge. This integration aims to bridge the gap between scientific rigor and the richness of non-scientific perspectives, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of complex systems.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The research is significant as it challenges traditional epistemological boundaries, advocating for a more inclusive approach to knowledge creation. By recognizing the validity of both empirical and intuitive insights, this dissertation seeks to enhance decision-making processes in various sectors, including public health, environmental management, and community development.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can PME and NSWK be integrated to enhance decision-making in complex systems?
