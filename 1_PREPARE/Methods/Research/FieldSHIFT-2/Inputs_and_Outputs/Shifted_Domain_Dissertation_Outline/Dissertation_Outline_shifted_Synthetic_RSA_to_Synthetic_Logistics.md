## Executive Summary
This dissertation aims to explore the innovative intersection of RSA cryptography and logistics, proposing a transformative framework that enhances security and operational efficiency in supply chain management. By integrating cryptographic principles, the research will address pressing challenges in logistics, such as data integrity, security protocols, and operational transparency. The findings are expected to have significant implications for both fields, fostering new methodologies and practices that can revolutionize how goods and information are managed in an increasingly digital world.

## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The fusion of RSA cryptography, a cornerstone of secure digital communication, with logistics, a critical component of modern supply chains, presents a unique opportunity to enhance the security and efficiency of logistics operations. RSA's reliance on mathematical principles for secure communication can be transposed onto logistics practices to address vulnerabilities in data transmission and resource management.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is significant as it pioneers the application of cryptographic principles in logistics, an area that has traditionally focused on operational efficiency without sufficient emphasis on data security. The novelty lies in creating a framework that applies RSA concepts, such as public key infrastructure and digital signatures, to develop secure logistics practices that can withstand emerging cyber threats.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can RSA cryptographic principles be effectively integrated into logistics operations to enhance security?
2. What are the potential impacts of implementing a logistics PKI on supply chain integrity?
3. How can digital signatures be used to verify shipment authenticity and reduce cargo theft?
