## Introduction
### Background of the Shifted Domain
The convergence of RSA cryptography and game design represents a significant shift in how we understand security and engagement in digital interactions. RSA, a public-key cryptosystem, ensures secure communication through complex mathematical algorithms, while game design focuses on creating immersive player experiences. This dissertation seeks to bridge these two fields, leveraging the strengths of cryptographic principles to address challenges in game mechanics and player engagement.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, merging cryptographic security with interactive game design. This fusion not only enhances player trust and engagement but also introduces innovative gameplay mechanics that can redefine player interactions. The significance of this research extends to potential applications in online gaming, educational simulations, and other interactive digital environments.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
- How can principles of RSA cryptography be effectively integrated into game design to enhance security and engagement?
- What are the implications of implementing secure game mechanics on player experience and trust?
- How can dynamic narrative structures inspired by cryptographic principles transform storytelling in games?

## Literature Review
### Historical Context of the Original Domains
The historical development of RSA cryptography and game design has shaped their respective fields. RSA, introduced in 1977, revolutionized secure communication, while game design has evolved from simple mechanics to complex, narrative-driven experiences. Understanding the evolution of these domains provides a foundation for exploring their intersection.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
Current research in RSA cryptography focuses on post-quantum security and the integration of cryptographic protocols in various applications. In contrast, game design research emphasizes player engagement, accessibility, and the integration of emerging technologies. However, there is a notable lack of exploration regarding the application of cryptographic principles in game mechanics.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
The intersection of RSA cryptography and game design presents unique opportunities to address gaps in player trust and engagement. By applying cryptographic principles to game mechanics, we can create secure environments that enhance player experience and satisfaction.

## Theoretical Framework
### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
- **Cryptographic Security**: The mathematical principles underpinning RSA, including prime factorization and modular arithmetic.
- **Game Mechanics**: Theories of player engagement, balance, and narrative structure in game design.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift
- **Secure Game Design**: A framework that incorporates cryptographic principles into game mechanics to ensure fair play and integrity.
- **Dynamic Narrative Design**: A model that allows players to unlock story elements based on in-game actions, akin to decrypting a message.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model
This dissertation proposes an integrated theoretical model that combines cryptographic security with game mechanics, creating a new paradigm for secure and engaging game design.

## Methodology
### Research Design Overview
A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the integration of RSA principles into game design.

### Data Collection Methods
- Surveys and interviews with game designers and players to gather insights on security concerns and engagement strategies.
