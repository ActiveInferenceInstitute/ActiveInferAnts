Example: The C-C bonds in alkanes are nonpolar due to the equal sharing of electrons between carbon atoms.
Example: The polarity of the C-O bond in alcohols contributes to their solubility in water.

Fact: Hybridization of atomic orbitals explains the geometry and bonding patterns in molecules.
Example: The sp3 hybridization in methane (CH4) results in its tetrahedral structure with 109.5° bond angles.
Example: The sp2 hybridization in ethylene (C2H4) leads to its planar structure with a 120° H-C-H bond angle.
Example: The sp hybridization in acetylene (C2H2) produces its linear structure with 180° bond angles.
