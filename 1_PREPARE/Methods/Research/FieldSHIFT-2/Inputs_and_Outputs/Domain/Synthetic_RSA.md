# RSA Cryptography

Definition: RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure data transmission.
Example: RSA is used in various applications such as secure web browsing, email encryption, and digital signatures.
Example: RSA relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.
Example: The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers.
Example: RSA involves two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Example: The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret by the owner.
Example: RSA key generation involves selecting two large prime numbers, computing their product (n), and finding a public and private key pair.
Example: The public key consists of the modulus (n) and the public exponent (e), while the private key consists of the modulus (n) and the private exponent (d).
Example: Encryption with RSA is performed by raising the plaintext message to the power of the public exponent (e) and taking the modulus (n).
