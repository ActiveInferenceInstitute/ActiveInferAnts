# Understanding the Dissertation: Neural Networks and the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This research dives into how two exciting areas—neural networks (which are like computer brains) and the Free Energy Principle (FEP, a theory about how living things predict and adapt to their surroundings)—can work together. The goal is to create a new way of thinking about how we learn and make decisions. By combining these ideas, the research hopes to improve artificial intelligence (AI) and help us understand how our own brains work better.

## Introduction

### What Are Neural Networks and the Free Energy Principle?

- **Neural Networks**: Imagine a web of interconnected lights (like a city’s streetlights) that can learn patterns, like when to turn on or off based on traffic. In computers, neural networks are systems that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.

- **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**: Think of this as a way of explaining how living things keep themselves balanced and ready for action. Just like how you might adjust your plans based on the weather forecast, living organisms try to minimize surprises in their environment.

### Why Is This Research Important?

This research is important because it connects two fields that usually don’t talk to each other much. By understanding how neural networks can use the FEP, we can create smarter AI that behaves more like humans. This could lead to better robots, apps, and tools that can adapt to our needs.

### Key Questions the Research Will Explore

1. How can neural networks help us understand how our brains predict things?
2. How do changes in our brain connections (synaptic plasticity) help us learn?
3. How can organizing information in layers (hierarchical structures) improve learning?
4. What does this mean for creating AI that can adapt to changing environments?

## Literature Review

### A Brief History

- **Neural Networks**: These have been around since the 1940s, starting with simple models and evolving into complex systems that can recognize images or understand language.

- **Free Energy Principle**: This idea gained traction in the 2000s and explains how our brains constantly predict what will happen next to minimize surprises.

### Current Knowledge

- **Neural Networks**: They are doing great things in areas like recognizing faces in photos or translating languages. However, we still don’t fully understand how they make decisions.

- **Free Energy Principle**: This principle is being used to explain behaviors and decision-making in humans, but we haven’t yet connected it thoroughly to neural networks.

### Gaps and Opportunities

There’s a big chance to explore how these two areas can work together. For example, we need to figure out how neural networks can help us understand the FEP better and vice versa.

## Theoretical Framework

### Key Theories

- **Hebbian Learning**: This is like saying, “If two things happen together, they get stronger together.” It’s how our brains learn from experience.

- **Predictive Processing**: Our brains are like prediction machines, always guessing what will happen next based on past experiences.

### New Ideas from This Research

By combining these theories, we can create new models that explain how our brains and AI can learn and adapt more effectively.

## Methodology

### How Will This Research Be Done?

1. **Literature Review**: The researcher will look at what’s already been written about these topics to find gaps and opportunities.
  
2. **Experiments**: They will run tests using computer simulations and brain studies to see how neural networks learn and adapt.

3. **Analysis**: They will use statistics and machine learning techniques to analyze the results and see if they support their ideas.

### Ethical Considerations

The researcher will make sure to handle data responsibly and think about how their findings could impact society, especially in sensitive areas like mental health.
