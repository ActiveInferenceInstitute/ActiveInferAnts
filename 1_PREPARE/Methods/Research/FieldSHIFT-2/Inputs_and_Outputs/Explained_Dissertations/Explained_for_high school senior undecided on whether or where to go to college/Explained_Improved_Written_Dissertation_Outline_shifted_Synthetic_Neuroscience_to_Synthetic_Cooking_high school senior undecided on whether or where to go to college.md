#### Literature Review

##### Historical Context of the Original Domains

###### Overview of Neural Networks

Neural networks are like a simplified version of our brain, where tiny connections (like neurons) work together to solve problems. Since the 1950s, these networks have evolved and are now used in many areas, from recognizing faces in photos to understanding spoken language.

###### Historical Developments in Culinary Arts

Cooking has changed a lot over the years, from ancient methods to modern techniques. In the 20th century, chefs started experimenting with science in cooking, leading to new styles like molecular gastronomy, where chemistry plays a big role in how food is prepared and presented.

##### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

###### Recent Advancements in Neural Network Research

Neural networks have made huge strides, especially in areas like artificial intelligence. These advancements can help us understand complex flavor combinations in cooking, just like they help computers recognize patterns.

###### Contemporary Culinary Trends and Challenges

Today, chefs are influenced by trends like plant-based diets and sustainability. This research can help chefs tackle these challenges by providing insights into how flavors work together.

##### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the exciting developments in both fields, there hasn't been much research connecting brain science and cooking. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap and explore how these two areas can work together to create new culinary innovations.

##### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

###### Development of a Culinary Neural Networks Model

This model combines ideas from both fields, emphasizing how ingredients and techniques are interconnected. This helps chefs navigate the complexities of flavor creation.

###### Introduction of Concepts such as Culinary Plasticity and Flavor Layering

- **Culinary Plasticity**: This is about how cooking can adapt based on changing ingredients or consumer preferences, similar to how our brains adjust to new information.
- **Flavor Layering**: This involves building flavors step-by-step, much like how neural networks process information in layers.

##### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The integrated model connects brain science with cooking, helping us understand how flavors can be developed and enhanced through a scientific lens.
