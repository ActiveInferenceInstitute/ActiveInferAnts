### Understanding the PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions

#### Executive Summary

Imagine if your ATM could learn from you, just like a friend who gets to know your preferences over time. This dissertation is all about using technology inspired by the human brain—called neural networks—to make ATMs (the machines that give you cash) smarter and more user-friendly. The goal is to create ATMs that can adapt to how you use them, making your banking experience smoother and safer. This research could change not just banking, but also how we interact with technology in places like stores and schools.

#### Introduction

**Background of the Shifted Domain**

Think of a traditional ATM as a simple vending machine for cash. It has a set way of doing things and doesn’t change much. Now, imagine if that machine could learn from your actions, like how Netflix recommends shows based on what you watch. This dissertation explores how we can take ideas from how our brains work and apply them to ATMs, making them more responsive to our needs.

**Significance and Novelty of the Research**

As technology advances, people expect more from their banking experiences. This research is unique because it combines brain science with banking technology. By making ATMs smarter, we can create machines that not only meet your needs but also anticipate them, making your experience better overall.

**Overarching Research Questions and Objectives**

1. How can we use brain-inspired technology to improve how ATMs work?
2. What happens when we make ATMs more responsive to users?
3. How can we predict how much cash an ATM will need based on user behavior?
4. How can feedback from users help ATMs learn and improve?

#### Literature Review

**Historical Context of the Original Domains**

- **Neural Networks:** These are computer systems designed to mimic how our brains work. They learn from experience, much like how you get better at a video game the more you play it. This technology has evolved significantly over the years, enabling computers to recognize patterns and make decisions.
  
- **ATM Transactions:** The first ATM was introduced in the late 1960s, allowing people to withdraw cash without needing a bank teller. Over time, ATMs have become more advanced, but they still operate on fixed programming that doesn’t adapt to users’ needs.

**Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields**

- **Neuroscience:** We now understand that our brains can change and adapt based on new experiences. This is important for creating systems that can learn and evolve.
  
- **Banking Technology:** Today’s ATMs are focused on user experience, but they still lack the ability to learn from users. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap by introducing adaptive features.

**Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain**

There hasn’t been much research connecting brain science with banking technology. This dissertation aims to fill that gap by creating ATMs that can learn from users, making them more effective and user-friendly.

#### Theoretical Framework

**Foundational Theories from Original Domains**

- **Neuroscience Theories:** Concepts like “cells that fire together, wire together” explain how our brains learn. These ideas can help us design ATMs that adapt based on user interactions.
  
- **Banking Theories:** Understanding how people accept new technologies is key to making ATMs more user-friendly.

**New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift**

This research proposes a new way of thinking about ATMs as learning systems. Just like our brains form connections based on experiences, ATMs can learn from how users interact with them.

**Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model**

The dissertation will create a model showing how ATMs can adapt and improve user interactions. This model will help ensure that ATMs are easy to use and meet user needs.

#### Methodology

**Research Design Overview**

The research will combine numbers (quantitative data) and personal stories (qualitative data) to understand how users feel about ATMs. Experiments will help test how well adaptive ATMs work.

**Data Collection Methods**

User surveys and interviews will gather opinions about ATMs. Analyzing transaction data will help measure how effective these adaptive systems are.

**Analytical Approaches**

Statistical methods will evaluate how well adaptive features improve user satisfaction and efficiency. Machine learning techniques will predict how much cash ATMs need based on past transactions.

**Ethical Considerations**

User privacy is crucial, and the research will ensure that all data is kept secure and anonymous.
