# Understanding the Dissertation: Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores how we can make artificial intelligence (AI) smarter by learning from how our brains work. Just like our brains have networks of neurons (the cells that send signals), AI has something called artificial neural networks (ANNs). The goal is to make these AI systems better at learning and adapting, much like how we do. This research could lead to amazing advancements in areas like healthcare, robotics, and even how computers think.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Imagine your brain as a huge network of roads (neurons) connected by intersections (synapses) where information travels. Scientists study these biological neural networks to understand how we learn and solve problems. By applying these insights to artificial neural networks, we can create AI that mimics our brain's abilities. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

Right now, many AI systems struggle with understanding new information or explaining their decisions. This research aims to fix these problems by taking inspiration from how our brains learn. If we can make AI systems that learn like humans, they could perform much better in real-world situations.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation asks important questions like:

- How can we make AI learn more effectively?
- What happens if we use different types of "neurons" in AI?
- How can we support AI systems like glial cells (supporting cells in our brain) help neurons?

The goal is to design new AI systems that learn better and are easier to understand.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Neural Networks

Biological neural networks are made up of neurons that send messages to each other. These neurons can change how they connect based on what we learn. This ability to change is called synaptic plasticity and is crucial for how we remember things.

#### Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks have come a long way since their creation. They started simple but have become more complex over time. However, they still have problems, like not being able to generalize well to new information. This research aims to tackle those challenges.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Research on Synaptic Plasticity

Scientists have learned a lot about how our brains adapt through synaptic plasticity. By mimicking these processes in AI, we can help machines learn more effectively.

#### Analysis of Current Challenges in ANNs

Current AI systems often cannot explain their decisions and sometimes make mistakes when faced with new data. This research aims to address these issues by incorporating biological principles.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There’s a gap between how biological systems learn and how AI systems work. This research seeks to fill that gap, creating AI that learns and adapts more like humans do.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neural Plasticity Theories

The theories about how our brains change with learning can help us improve AI. By using these theories, we can create AI that adapts better to new information.

#### Theories of Neuron Diversity

Just like different types of neurons in our brain serve different functions, using diverse neuron types in AI can help it process information more effectively.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The research proposes a new framework that connects biological learning mechanisms to AI, making it more efficient and adaptable.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

This model combines biological principles with AI strategies to create smarter systems. It shows how different mechanisms work together to improve learning.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

The research uses a mix of theoretical modeling (designing new ideas) and simulations (testing those ideas) to see how well they work.

### Data Collection Methods

The researchers will gather data on how well different AI models perform, looking at factors like accuracy and how quickly they learn.

### Analytical Approaches

They will use statistical methods to compare traditional AI with the new biologically inspired models to see which performs better.

### Ethical Considerations

The research will also consider the ethical implications of creating smarter AI, ensuring that it is used responsibly.
