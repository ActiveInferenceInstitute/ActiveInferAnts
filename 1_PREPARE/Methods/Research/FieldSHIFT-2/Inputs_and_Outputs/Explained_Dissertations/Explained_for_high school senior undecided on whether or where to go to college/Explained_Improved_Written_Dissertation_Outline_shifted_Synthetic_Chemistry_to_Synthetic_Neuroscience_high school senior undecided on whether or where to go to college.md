### Understanding Neurochemical Dynamics: A New Way to Look at the Brain

#### Executive Summary

Imagine if we could understand how our brains work by looking at them like chemical reactions happening in a lab. This dissertation explores that idea. It combines concepts from chemistry—like how substances react with each other—with how our brain cells (neurons) communicate and learn. The goal is to find new ways to understand brain function, improve treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s, and even help create smarter artificial intelligence.

#### Introduction

**Background of the Shifted Domain**

Traditionally, scientists studying the brain have focused on computers and algorithms to understand how we think and learn. But what if we could also use ideas from chemistry? Just like how mixing certain chemicals can create a reaction, our brain cells communicate through chemical signals. This research wants to show how looking at the brain through a chemical lens can help us understand it better.

**Significance and Novelty of the Research**

This research is important because it introduces new ways to think about how our brains work. By using chemical principles, we can gain fresh insights into how our brains learn and adapt. This could lead to better treatments for brain diseases and advancements in computer technology that mimics human thinking.

**Overarching Research Questions and Objectives**

1. How can we apply chemical reaction principles to understand how the brain works?
2. What role do brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) play in learning?
3. How do brain circuits keep everything balanced?
4. How can this knowledge help treat brain diseases?

#### Literature Review

**Historical Context of the Original Domains**

- **Chemical Reactions**: Chemistry has evolved from ancient alchemy to modern science. Scientists like Lavoisier helped us understand how substances interact. Knowing how these reactions work helps us understand the world around us.
  
- **Neural Networks**: The study of how brain cells communicate has also changed. Early models were simple, but now we have complex systems that can learn and adapt, much like our brains do.

**Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields**

- **Chemical Reaction Dynamics**: Today, scientists use advanced tools to study how chemicals react. They can see how reactions happen at a tiny level, which helps in many fields, including medicine.
  
- **Neuroscience**: Techniques like brain imaging allow scientists to see how our brains work in real-time. However, there’s still a need for models that can explain the brain’s complex interactions.

**Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain**

Even with all the advancements, there are still gaps in understanding how chemistry and brain science can work together. This dissertation aims to fill those gaps by combining ideas from both fields.

#### Theoretical Framework

**Foundational Theories from Original Domains**

- **Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics**: These concepts help us understand how fast reactions happen and the energy involved. They’re key to linking chemistry with brain function.
  
- **Neural Plasticity and Learning Theories**: This refers to how our brains can change and adapt based on experiences. Understanding this is crucial for connecting it to chemical processes.

**New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift**

- **Neural Reactions**: The idea here is to think of brain processes like chemical reactions, where inputs (like experiences) lead to outputs (like actions or memories).
  
- **Catalytic Neurotransmitter Dynamics**: Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help brain cells communicate. This section looks at how they can speed up or change these communications, similar to how catalysts work in chemical reactions.

**Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model**

This model suggests that brain circuits operate like chemical systems, where the interactions of neurotransmitters can be understood through chemical principles.
