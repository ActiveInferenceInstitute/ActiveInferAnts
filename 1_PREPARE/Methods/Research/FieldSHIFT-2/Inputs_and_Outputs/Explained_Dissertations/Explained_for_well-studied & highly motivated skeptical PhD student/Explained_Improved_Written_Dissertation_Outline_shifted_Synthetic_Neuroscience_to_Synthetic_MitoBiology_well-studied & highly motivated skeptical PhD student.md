# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Mitochondrial Function

## Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a groundbreaking idea: what if we could apply principles from neural networks—structures that process information in our brains—to understand how mitochondria, the energy factories of our cells, function? The research introduces a concept called the "Shifted Domain," which suggests that mitochondria operate like interconnected neural circuits. This new perspective has the potential to change how we view cellular metabolism and resilience, with implications for diagnostics and therapies in health and disease.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

**Neural Networks:** Think of neural networks as complex webs of neurons that communicate and adapt based on experiences. They are essential for learning and memory due to their ability to change connections (plasticity) when exposed to different stimuli.

**Mitochondrial Function:** Mitochondria are traditionally seen as the "powerhouses" of cells, generating ATP (energy currency) through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. However, they do much more, including regulating metabolism and signaling within cells. This dissertation posits that we can understand mitochondrial function better by viewing these organelles as dynamic networks, similar to neural circuits.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it aims to bridge the gap between two fields: mitochondrial biology and neuroscience. By applying neural network concepts to mitochondria, we can gain new insights into how these organelles adapt to energy demands and how they communicate within the cell. This interdisciplinary approach could lead to groundbreaking hypotheses and experimental designs.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation revolves around three main questions:
- How do mitochondrial networks adapt to changes in energy needs?
- What mechanisms drive mitochondrial plasticity under metabolic stress?
- How do these dynamics affect cellular signaling and decision-making?

The objective is to create a unified framework that integrates neural network concepts into mitochondrial biology, enriching our understanding of both.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks have a rich history, starting with the neuron doctrine proposed by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, which established that neurons communicate through synapses. The principle of Hebbian learning—"cells that fire together, wire together"—is foundational for understanding how these networks adapt and learn.

#### Mitochondrial Function

Mitochondria were first recognized for their role in ATP production. Over time, research has expanded to include their roles in cellular signaling and stress responses. Understanding mitochondrial dynamics—how they change shape and function—has become crucial, especially in the context of diseases.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While neural networks have advanced in understanding their plasticity and computational capabilities, mitochondrial research has increasingly focused on their dynamics and health. However, the interplay between neural and mitochondrial functions remains underexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There are significant gaps in understanding how neural plasticity relates to mitochondrial plasticity. This dissertation aims to identify these gaps and propose interdisciplinary research opportunities that could lead to innovative breakthroughs.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

The framework combines key theories from both fields. In neuroscience, concepts like Hebbian learning and neural oscillations provide insights into adaptability. In mitochondrial biology, bioenergetics and mitochondrial dynamics highlight how these organelles respond to cellular needs.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research introduces new constructs, such as viewing mitochondria as interconnected networks and recognizing their plasticity in response to energy demands. This perspective parallels how synapses adapt in neural networks.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The model suggests that mitochondrial networks function similarly to neural circuits, characterized by adaptability and dynamic signaling. This interconnectedness implies that neural activity can influence mitochondrial behavior and vice versa, opening avenues for interdisciplinary exploration.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

The dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. This allows for a comprehensive exploration of the hypotheses generated.

### Data Collection Methods

Data will be collected through in vitro studies using advanced imaging techniques to visualize mitochondrial networks and assess their dynamics. Computational modeling will also play a role in predicting mitochondrial responses to energy demands.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical methods and computational tools will be used to analyze data, identify patterns, and model interactions between neural and mitochondrial functions.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical guidelines will be strictly followed, ensuring humane treatment of subjects and responsible data management.
