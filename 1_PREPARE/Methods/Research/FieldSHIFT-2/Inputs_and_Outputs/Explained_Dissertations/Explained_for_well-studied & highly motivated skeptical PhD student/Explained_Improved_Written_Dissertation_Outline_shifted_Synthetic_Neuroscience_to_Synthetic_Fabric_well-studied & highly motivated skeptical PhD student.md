# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores how principles from neural networks—essentially, the way our brains process information—can be applied to the fabric industry. Think of it as using the brain's interconnectedness and adaptability to create textiles that are not just static pieces of fabric but dynamic, responsive systems. The goal is to enhance creativity, sustainability, and consumer engagement in textile design and production. By merging cutting-edge computational theories with fabric arts, the research aims to redefine how we think about textiles, making them more interactive and aligned with societal needs.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Traditionally, textiles have been viewed as static objects. However, this research challenges that notion by proposing that textiles can be dynamic, much like neural networks. Imagine a fabric that changes its color or texture based on temperature or user interaction—this is akin to how neural networks learn and adapt. The rise of smart textiles, which integrate technology for enhanced user experiences, sets the stage for this innovative approach.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The novelty of this research lies in its interdisciplinary approach, bridging advanced computational theories with traditional textile practices. By applying neural network principles, the dissertation aims to create textiles that are not only visually appealing but also functional and sustainable. This could lead to personalized consumer experiences and reduced waste through on-demand production.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation seeks to answer three main questions:

1. How can neural network principles be integrated into textile design and production?
2. What effects do adaptive textiles have on consumer satisfaction and sustainability?
3. How can feedback mechanisms reshape the design process in the fabric industry?

The objectives include developing a framework for this integration, assessing consumer experiences with adaptive textiles, and exploring feedback's role in design.

### Hypotheses

1. **H1**: Integrating neural network principles will enhance designers' creativity, resulting in innovative fabric patterns.
2. **H2**: Consumers will prefer adaptive textiles, leading to higher satisfaction and brand loyalty.
3. **H3**: Feedback mechanisms will promote sustainable practices through real-time design adjustments.

## Literature Review
