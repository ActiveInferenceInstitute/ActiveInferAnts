# Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the exciting possibility of merging concepts from biological neural networks (BNNs)—the networks in our brains—with artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are the backbone of many AI systems today. The goal is to enhance ANNs by incorporating principles such as **synaptic plasticity** (the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time), **neuron diversity** (the existence of different types of neurons), and **glial support** (the role of supportive cells in the brain). By doing this, we aim to improve the efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability of ANNs, which could lead to more advanced AI systems capable of learning and adapting in ways that are more similar to human cognition.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of BNNs and ANNs is a rapidly growing field. Our brains, composed of approximately 86 billion neurons, are incredibly complex and efficient at learning and problem-solving. By understanding how biological systems learn and adapt, we can inform the design of ANNs. This raises fundamental questions about intelligence and how we can create machines that mimic human-like learning.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

Current ANNs often struggle with issues like **overfitting** (performing well on training data but poorly on new data) and lack of interpretability (understanding how they make decisions). By leveraging biological principles, this research aims to create more adaptive learning algorithms and diverse neuron models, potentially revolutionizing AI and bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation is guided by key questions:
- How can we integrate synaptic plasticity into ANN training algorithms?
- What effects do diverse neuron types have on ANN performance?
- How can glial-inspired structures improve the efficiency of neural computations?

The objectives are to develop and validate new ANN architectures that incorporate these biological mechanisms.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Neural Networks

Biological neural networks consist of neurons connected by synapses. Neurons can be categorized into types (e.g., sensory, motor) based on their roles. Learning in biological systems is largely due to synaptic plasticity, which allows for the strengthening or weakening of connections based on neuron activity, a process that is fundamental to memory and learning.

#### Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks have evolved from simple models like the perceptron to more complex structures such as CNNs and RNNs. Despite advancements, they still face challenges like overfitting and limited interpretability, highlighting the need for innovative approaches inspired by biological systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Examination of Existing Research on Synaptic Plasticity

Research has shown that mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are essential for learning and memory in biological systems. These insights can inform the development of algorithms for ANNs that mimic these processes, enhancing their adaptability.

#### Analysis of Current Challenges in ANNs

Current ANNs often lack transparency in their decision-making processes and struggle with generalization. These challenges underscore the need for approaches that integrate biological principles to improve robustness and interpretability.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements, there is a significant gap in applying biological principles to computational models. By incorporating concepts like synaptic plasticity and neuron diversity, we can develop more efficient and cognitively aligned AI systems.
