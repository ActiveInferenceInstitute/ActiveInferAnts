# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to the Free Energy Principle

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the intersection of **neural networks** (both biological and artificial) and the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**. It proposes a unified framework that integrates concepts from both fields, aiming to enhance our understanding of cognitive processes. The research focuses on how hierarchical organization, dynamic adaptation, and information processing in neural networks can inform and be informed by the FEP, which describes how systems minimize the difference between expected and actual sensory inputs.

The anticipated contributions include:
- **Theoretical advancements** that bridge both fields.
- **Novel computational models** that mimic cognitive processes.
- **Practical applications** in AI and neuroscience that could revolutionize our approach to cognition and adaptive behavior.

Additionally, the work introduces testable hypotheses and methodologies to assess how neural dynamics relate to free energy minimization, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The **Shifted Domain** represents a novel integration of neural networks with the Free Energy Principle. The FEP posits that biological systems strive to minimize prediction errorsâ€”essentially, the difference between what they expect to sense and what they actually sense. This concept is rooted in **Bayesian inference** (updating beliefs based on new evidence) and **statistical mechanics** (how systems behave in terms of energy states).

By merging neural network dynamics with the FEP, we can gain deeper insights into how cognitive processes operate in a predictive and adaptive manner.

**Key Concepts of the Shifted Domain:**

| Concept                     | Neural Networks                          | Free Energy Principle                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Learning Mechanism         | Backpropagation, Hebbian Learning      | Predictive Coding, Active Inference     |
| Adaptation                 | Synaptic Plasticity                     | Variational Free Energy Minimization    |
| Hierarchical Structure      | Deep Learning Architectures             | Markov Blankets, Hierarchical Models    |

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it connects two previously distinct fields, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of cognition. The novelty lies in applying neural network dynamics to the FEP, offering insights into learning, adaptation, and decision-making.

The exploration of this intersection raises critical questions about cognition and the potential for artificial systems to replicate human-like adaptability.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can neural networks enhance our understanding of predictive coding within the FEP?
2. What role does synaptic plasticity play in updating generative models in response to changes?
3. How can hierarchical structures in neural networks optimize free energy minimization?
4. What are the implications for developing adaptive AI systems in dynamic environments?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

The history of artificial neural networks (ANNs) dates back to the 1940s. The perceptron model introduced by Rosenblatt laid the foundation for understanding how simple units can learn to classify inputs. Key advancements include:
- **Backpropagation**: A method for training deep networks by adjusting weights based on error.
- **Deep Learning**: Techniques that have revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision.

Biological neural networks have also been extensively studied, revealing insights into synaptic plasticity and neural coding.

#### Free Energy Principle

The FEP has roots in thermodynamics and gained prominence in cognitive science through the work of Karl Friston. It posits that biological systems minimize free energy, interpreted as prediction error in Bayesian terms. This principle has been applied to various cognitive processes, emphasizing predictive coding and active inference.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neural Networks

Deep learning has led to breakthroughs in many areas, but challenges remain in interpretability and generalization, especially in dynamic environments.

#### Free Energy Principle

Current research has expanded the FEP's application to include social cognition and decision-making. However, a comprehensive integration with neural networks is still largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of these fields presents several research opportunities:
- Developing a unified model that incorporates principles from both domains.
- Exploring how neural dynamics can embody predictive coding and active inference.
- Investigating hierarchical processing for optimizing free energy minimization.

**Identified Gaps and Opportunities:**

| Gap in Literature                        | Opportunity for Research                                   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of integration between fields       | Develop a unified model incorporating both domains        |
| Limited understanding of predictive coding in neural networks | Explore neural dynamics in the context of FEP |
| Insufficient exploration of hierarchical processing | Investigate optimization of free energy minimization across cognitive levels |
