# PhD Dissertation: Transposition of Neural Networks to Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the intersection of **neural networks**—which mimic how our brains learn—and **quantum computation**, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics. The research introduces the concept of the "Shifted Domain," where we transpose neural network methodologies into quantum computing to create **quantum neural networks**. The goal is to harness quantum phenomena to enhance learning and processing capabilities, potentially transforming fields like machine learning and data analysis. 

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Imagine neural networks as a sophisticated mimicry of the human brain, evolving from simple models to complex systems that can learn and recognize patterns. In contrast, quantum computation operates on **qubits**, which can exist in multiple states at once due to a phenomenon called **superposition**. By combining these two domains, we open up exciting possibilities for new types of neural networks that utilize quantum properties for better performance.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to create a new paradigm that merges the adaptive learning of neural networks with the extraordinary processing power of quantum computers. The novelty comes from introducing concepts like **quantum synaptic plasticity**—akin to how our brain's synapses strengthen or weaken—and **entangled neurons**, which could revolutionize how we process information.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can we effectively translate neural network principles into quantum computation?
2. What impact does quantum synaptic plasticity have on learning algorithms?
3. In what ways can quantum neural networks outperform classical models?
4. What interdisciplinary frameworks can be developed to support this integration?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks have a rich history, beginning with the **perceptron** in the 1950s, which laid the groundwork for AI. The introduction of **backpropagation** in the 1980s allowed for training complex networks, leading to the deep learning revolution we see today.

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation emerged in the 1980s with pioneers like Richard Feynman, who envisioned computers that could simulate physical systems. Fast forward, and we now have quantum algorithms that can outperform classical ones in specific tasks, thanks to advances in **qubit technology**.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While advancements in both fields are significant, the intersection—where neural networks meet quantum computing—remains relatively unexplored. This dissertation aims to fill that gap by investigating how neural network principles can enhance quantum computation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the progress in both neural networks and quantum computing, there’s a lack of research on their integration. This presents a unique opportunity to explore new theoretical frameworks and practical applications, such as improved optimization techniques and innovative AI approaches.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains
