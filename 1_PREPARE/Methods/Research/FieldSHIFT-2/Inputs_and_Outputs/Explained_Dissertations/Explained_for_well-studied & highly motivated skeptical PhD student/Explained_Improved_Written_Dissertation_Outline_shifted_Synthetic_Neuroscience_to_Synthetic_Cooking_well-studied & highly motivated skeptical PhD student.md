## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Theories in Neural Networks

Neural networks are based on interconnectedness (how neurons communicate), synaptic plasticity (how connections strengthen or weaken), and neurotransmission (the process of sending signals). These concepts can be likened to how ingredients interact and evolve in culinary practices.

#### Examination of Culinary Theories

Culinary theories involve understanding flavor profiles (the unique taste combinations of dishes) and cooking techniques. Grasping these theories is essential for creating innovative culinary experiences.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of a Culinary Neural Networks Model

This model synthesizes neural network principles with culinary practices, emphasizing the interconnectedness of ingredients and techniques. It helps chefs navigate the complexities of flavor development and enhance their culinary skills.
