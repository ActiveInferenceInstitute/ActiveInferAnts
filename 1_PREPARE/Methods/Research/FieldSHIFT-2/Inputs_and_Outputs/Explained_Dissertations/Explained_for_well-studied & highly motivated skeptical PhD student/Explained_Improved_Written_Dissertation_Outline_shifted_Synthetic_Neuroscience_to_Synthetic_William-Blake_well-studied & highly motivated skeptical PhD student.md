# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation proposes a fresh perspective by merging neural networks—a model of cognition and learning— with the life and works of William Blake, a key figure in the Romantic movement. The aim is to reinterpret Blake's themes through the lens of neuroscience concepts like synaptic plasticity (how connections in the brain strengthen or weaken), neural oscillations (brain wave patterns), and cognitive resonance (how themes resonate emotionally and intellectually with readers). The overarching goal is to deepen our understanding of Blake’s artistic vision and its implications for human consciousness, while also suggesting interdisciplinary applications in fields like cognitive science, art education, and digital humanities.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The intersection of neural networks and literary analysis is groundbreaking. Neural networks, inspired by the brain's architecture, consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that communicate through weighted connections (synapses). Think of Blake's themes as nodes in a network; each theme interacts with others, much like neurons firing in response to stimuli. 

Key questions arise: How do Blake's interconnected themes mirror the brain's neural pathways? What cognitive processes are activated when readers engage with these themes? These inquiries guide our exploration of Blake's work through a neural network framework.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it bridges neuroscience and literature—two traditionally separate domains. Applying neural network principles to Blake's work offers new interpretations of his themes and contributes to our understanding of the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation. The novelty lies in this interdisciplinary approach, which could lead to new insights into creativity itself.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Blake's themes be modeled as neural networks?
2. What do the dynamics of neural communication reveal about Blake's artistic expression?
3. How might this interdisciplinary approach influence neuroscience, literary studies, and education?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

Neural networks stem from early artificial intelligence research, laying the groundwork for understanding cognitive functions. Pioneers like McCulloch and Pitts established foundational principles, while modern advances in deep learning have broadened these applications. 

Blake, meanwhile, was a vital figure in the Romantic era, known for his poetry, visual art, and philosophical insights. His work reflects dualities—innocence versus experience, body versus spirit—that resonate deeply with human experiences, making him an ideal subject for this research.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While neural networks have found applications in various fields, their intersection with literary analysis remains largely unexplored. Existing studies on Blake focus on thematic and historical criticism, but this dissertation seeks to fill that gap by applying neural network principles to enhance our understanding of his work.

#### Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Existing Literature

| Author          | Focus Area                          | Findings/Contributions                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| McCulloch & Pitts (1943) | Neural Networks Foundations          | Established basic principles of neural computation. |
| Eagleton (2010) | Literary Criticism                  | Explored socio-political themes in Blake's work. |
| Johnson (2015)  | Cognitive Literary Studies          | Investigated cognitive aspects of poetic interpretation. |

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite growing interdisciplinary interest, research combining neuroscience and literature is sparse. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovative insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic engagement, proposing that neural network concepts can illuminate the cognitive processes behind Blake's themes.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key neural network concepts, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations, provide a basis for understanding cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity relates to how connections in the brain adapt over time, which can be likened to the evolution of themes in Blake’s work. Neural oscillations refer to rhythmic brain activity that facilitates communication—analogous to the rhythmic patterns in Blake's poetry.

Blake's dualities serve as a rich tapestry for exploring human experience, conceptualized here as thematic networks that communicate like neural networks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces "thematic neurons" (central motifs in Blake's work) and "synapses" (the connections between these themes). It also proposes "cognitive resonance" as a measure of how themes engage readers emotionally and intellectually.

#### Hypothesis 1: Thematic Resonance and Reader Engagement
- **Hypothesis**: Readers will experience higher emotional resonance with interconnected themes compared to isolated ones.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The model visualizes Blake's themes as a dynamic neural network, illustrating their interconnections and influences. This framework aids in analyzing the complexity of Blake's artistic vision and how themes resonate within human consciousness.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach combines qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes and their connections.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection involves analyzing Blake's texts and visual art while gathering cognitive and emotional responses from readers through surveys and interviews. Thematic analysis identifies central themes, while reader responses reveal engagement levels.

#### Table 2: Data Collection Strategy

| Methodology          | Description                                  | Purpose                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Thematic Analysis    | Qualitative analysis of Blake's texts       | Identify central themes and motifs           |
| Reader Surveys       | Collection of cognitive and emotional data   | Assess reader engagement and interpretation  |
| Neural Network Modeling | Quantitative modeling of thematic connections | Visualize and analyze thematic interrelations |

### Analytical Approaches

Neural network modeling will visualize thematic connections, while qualitative content analysis interprets reader responses to highlight cognitive and emotional engagement.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent from participants and addressing biases in interpreting texts and responses, adhering to guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
