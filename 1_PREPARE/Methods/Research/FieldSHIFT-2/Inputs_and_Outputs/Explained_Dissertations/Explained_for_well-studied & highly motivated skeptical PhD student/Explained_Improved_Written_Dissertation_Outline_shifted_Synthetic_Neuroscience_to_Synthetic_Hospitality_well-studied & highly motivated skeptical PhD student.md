# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Network Concepts to Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores an innovative approach to enhancing guest experiences in the hospitality industry by applying concepts from neural networks—both biological and artificial. The central idea is that just as neural networks process and adapt to information, hospitality providers can use similar strategies to understand and anticipate guest needs. The goal is to create a framework that boosts guest satisfaction and loyalty through adaptive, data-driven service strategies. This research aims to bridge the fields of hospitality management and neuroscience, offering practical insights for industry professionals while paving the way for future interdisciplinary studies.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The hospitality sector is increasingly leveraging technology to improve guest experiences. Simultaneously, neuroscience has advanced our understanding of how interconnected systems react to stimuli. By viewing guest interactions as neural networks, this dissertation posits that hospitality providers can gain deeper insights into guest needs, leading to enhanced satisfaction and loyalty.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research introduces a fresh perspective on guest experience management by merging it with neural network principles. This interdisciplinary approach is expected to yield new insights into service personalization and operational efficiency, potentially reshaping service delivery in hospitality.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation seeks to answer three main questions:

1. How can neural network concepts enhance our understanding of guest experiences in hospitality?
2. What implications do these concepts have for staff training and service delivery?
3. How can businesses leverage guest data for adaptive service models?

The objectives include exploring the parallels between neural networks and guest experience, developing a theoretical framework, providing empirical evidence, and formulating testable hypotheses for future research.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks in Cognitive Science and Machine Learning

Neural networks have been pivotal in cognitive science for modeling brain functions. Early work focused on Hebbian learning, which suggests that connections strengthen when neurons fire together—this principle underlies learning in both biological and artificial networks. In machine learning, neural networks are powerful tools for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

#### Evolution of Guest Experience Theories in Hospitality Management

Guest experience theories have evolved from basic service quality to emphasizing personalization and emotional engagement. The integration of digital tools has transformed how businesses respond to guest preferences, highlighting the need for innovative frameworks that incorporate emerging technologies like neural networks.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Advancements in Neural Network Applications

Neural networks are being used across industries, from healthcare to finance, for tasks like diagnostics and predictive analytics. Recent developments in explainable AI (XAI) improve our understanding of these systems, fostering greater trust in their applications.

#### Trends in Guest Experience Management

Personalization and technology integration are key trends in hospitality. Data analytics allows businesses to tailor services to individual preferences, making it essential for providers to proactively anticipate guest needs.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements, there's a notable gap in research that merges neuroscience with hospitality. This dissertation aims to fill that gap by exploring how neural network principles can enhance service delivery and deepen our understanding of guest interactions.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Personalization | Enhanced guest satisfaction and loyalty                     | Development of tailored service offerings                  |
| Improved Staff Training    | More effective communication and collaboration among staff | Enhanced service delivery through teamwork                  |
| Data-Driven Decision Making | Greater operational efficiency and responsiveness           | Adoption of analytics for real-time service adjustments      |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Neural Network Theories

Hebbian learning and reinforcement learning are foundational to understanding how systems adapt. These theories can help model guest interactions in hospitality, suggesting that businesses can learn from past experiences to improve future service.

#### Service Quality and Experience Theories in Hospitality

Models like SERVQUAL highlight dimensions of service that influence guest satisfaction. Mapping these dimensions to neural network principles can help optimize service quality.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of the "Guest Experience Neural Model"

This model synthesizes neural network concepts with guest experience theories, viewing interactions as networks of interconnected nodes (staff and touchpoints) that respond to guest data (neurotransmitters). This framework offers a basis for empirical testing.

#### Neural Plasticity and Service Adaptation Strategies

Neural plasticity—the ability to adapt based on experiences—provides insights into how hospitality businesses can evolve their services in response to guest feedback.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual representation illustrates the interaction between guest data, service touchpoints, and staff interactions, highlighting how neural network principles can inform guest experience management.
