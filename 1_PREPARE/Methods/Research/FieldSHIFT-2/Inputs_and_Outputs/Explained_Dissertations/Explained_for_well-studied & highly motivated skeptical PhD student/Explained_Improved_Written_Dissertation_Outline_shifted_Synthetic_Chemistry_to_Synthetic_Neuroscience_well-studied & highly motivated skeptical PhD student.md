## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Think of the brain as a complex orchestra, where each neuron plays its part in harmony. Traditional neuroscience has often focused on the notes (neural signals) without fully appreciating the underlying rhythm (chemical processes) that guides them. By examining neural processes through the lens of chemistry, we can better understand the intricate mechanisms behind cognition, learning, and memory. 

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is pivotal because it reinterprets neural processes using chemical principles. Imagine using the rules of chemical reactions—like how substances interact and change—to explain how neurons communicate and adapt. This fresh perspective could lead to breakthroughs in understanding synaptic transmission (how neurons talk to each other), plasticity (how they change over time), and equilibrium (how they maintain stability). Essentially, it’s about creating a new language that bridges chemistry and neuroscience.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can we apply chemical reaction principles to neural processes?
2. In what ways do neurotransmitters act as catalysts for synaptic plasticity?
3. How do neural circuits maintain stability in the face of changing inputs?
4. What are the implications of these insights for treating neurodegenerative diseases?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemical Reactions

The study of chemical reactions has evolved significantly, from the mystical practices of alchemy to the precise methodologies of modern chemistry. Key concepts like reaction kinetics (the speed of reactions), thermodynamics (energy changes), and catalysis (how substances speed up reactions) have shaped our understanding of how substances interact.

#### Neural Networks

Neural network theory has similarly advanced. Initially inspired by biological systems, early models like the perceptron laid the groundwork for understanding how simple units can solve complex problems. Today, our models are much more sophisticated, incorporating insights from cognitive neuroscience.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemical Reaction Dynamics

Modern techniques, such as spectroscopy and computational chemistry, allow researchers to visualize and understand chemical reactions at a molecular level. This has led to significant advancements, especially in catalysis.

#### Neuroscience

In neuroscience, tools like optogenetics and fMRI have revolutionized our ability to observe and manipulate neural activity. However, there is still a gap in integrative models that account for the complex, non-linear interactions within neural circuits.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite progress in both fields, there are areas where insights from one can enhance the other. For example, while we understand chemical kinetics well, similar models are lacking in neuroscience. This dissertation aims to fill that gap by proposing an integrative model that combines both chemical and neural dynamics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Chemical kinetics examines how quickly reactions occur and what factors influence this speed. Thermodynamics looks at the energy changes during reactions, which helps us understand how and why reactions happen. These principles are crucial for modeling neural dynamics.

#### Neural Plasticity and Learning Theories

Neural plasticity is the brain's ability to adapt based on experience, with theories like Hebbian learning highlighting how the strength of synaptic connections changes with activity. Understanding these theories is essential for drawing parallels between chemical and neural processes.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Neural Reactions

The dissertation proposes viewing neural processes as analogous to chemical reactions. By defining "neural reactions" as the transformations that occur within neural circuits, we can apply chemical kinetics to model these processes, offering a new perspective on information processing in the brain.

#### Catalytic Neurotransmitter Dynamics

Neurotransmitters can be likened to catalysts in chemical reactions, facilitating and modulating neural signaling. This section explores how neurotransmitters influence synaptic plasticity and how their dynamics can be modeled through catalysis principles.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model integrates insights from both chemical and neural dynamics, illustrating how neural circuits function similarly to chemical systems. This helps us understand neurotransmitter interactions in terms of reaction kinetics and equilibrium states.
