# Explanation of PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to William Blake's Life and Work

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates a novel intersection between neural networks—models inspired by the human brain—and the life and works of the poet and artist William Blake. By applying concepts from neuroscience such as synaptic plasticity (how connections between neurons strengthen or weaken), neural oscillations (rhythmic brain activity), and cognitive resonance (the emotional and intellectual engagement of readers), the research aims to derive deeper insights into Blake's artistic vision and its implications for understanding human consciousness. This interdisciplinary approach not only enriches literary studies but also has potential applications in cognitive science, art education, and digital humanities, ultimately enhancing our understanding of creativity and artistic expression.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The integration of neural networks with literary analysis represents a significant breakthrough in how we understand creativity. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes (akin to neurons) that communicate through weighted connections (similar to synapses). In this framework, Blake's themes can be viewed as nodes in a network, each influencing and interacting with one another. 

To explore this relationship, we can ask: How do the interconnected themes in Blake's work reflect the neural pathways in our brains? What cognitive processes are activated when readers engage with these thematic networks? These questions guide our exploration of Blake’s oeuvre through the lens of neural networks.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is groundbreaking because it merges two traditionally separate domains: neuroscience and literature. By applying neural network principles to Blake's work, the dissertation provides fresh interpretations of his themes and contributes to discussions on the cognitive processes involved in artistic creation. The novelty lies in the interdisciplinary approach that recontextualizes Blake's artistic endeavors through cognitive science, potentially yielding new insights into creativity itself.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can Blake's themes be modeled as neural networks?
2. In what ways do the dynamics of neural communication enhance our understanding of Blake's artistic expression?
3. What implications does this interdisciplinary approach have for neuroscience, literary studies, and education?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

The roots of neural networks in cognitive science trace back to early artificial intelligence explorations. Foundational work by researchers like McCulloch and Pitts laid the groundwork for understanding neural computation. As neural networks evolved, their applications expanded, inviting literary scholars to consider the cognitive dimensions of artistic creation.

William Blake, a pivotal figure in the Romantic movement, blended poetry, visual art, and philosophical inquiry against a backdrop of social upheaval. His work is characterized by themes of duality, spirituality, and the human condition, making him an ideal candidate for this interdisciplinary exploration.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

While research in neural networks has expanded into areas like image recognition and natural language processing, the intersection of neural networks and literary analysis remains largely unexplored. Existing studies on Blake primarily focus on thematic criticism and historical context. This dissertation aims to fill that gap by applying neural network principles to Blake's work, enriching our understanding of his themes and their cognitive implications.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite growing interest in interdisciplinary studies, there is a notable lack of research combining neuroscience and literature. This dissertation identifies opportunities for innovative insights into the cognitive and emotional dimensions of artistic engagement. By applying neural network concepts to Blake's themes, we aim to illuminate the cognitive processes that shape artistic expression and audience reception.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

Key concepts in neural networks, such as synaptic plasticity and neural oscillations, provide a foundation for understanding cognitive processes. Synaptic plasticity refers to the adaptability of synapses in response to learning, while neural oscillations represent rhythmic activity that facilitates communication between brain regions. These concepts can be applied to Blake's work, where thematic evolution can be seen as analogous to neural adaptations.

Blake's philosophical dualities—like innocence versus experience and material versus divine—serve as a rich tapestry for exploring human experience. These dualities can be conceptualized as thematic networks that communicate and influence one another, paralleling the interconnected nature of neural networks.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This dissertation introduces the concepts of thematic neurons and synapses within Blake's work. Thematic neurons represent central motifs, while synapses illustrate the connections between these themes. Additionally, cognitive resonance is proposed to measure emotional engagement, capturing the dynamic interplay between reader interpretation and thematic expression.

#### Hypothesis 1: Thematic Resonance and Reader Engagement
- **Hypothesis**: Readers engaging with interconnected themes will experience higher emotional resonance compared to isolated themes.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed model visualizes Blake's themes as a dynamic neural network, illustrating their interconnections and influences. This framework aids in analyzing the complexity of Blake's artistic vision and provides insights into how themes evolve and resonate within human consciousness.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

This dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative literary analysis with quantitative modeling techniques. This design allows for a comprehensive exploration of Blake's themes while harnessing the analytical capabilities of neural network modeling.

### Data Collection Methods

Data collection involves two key components: thematic analysis of Blake's texts and visual art, and gathering cognitive and emotional response data from readers through surveys and interviews. Thematic analysis focuses on identifying central themes and their interconnections, while reader responses provide insights into their engagement with Blake's work.
