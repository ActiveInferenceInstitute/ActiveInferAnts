### PhD Dissertation Explained: Transposing Neural Networks to the Free Energy Principle

---

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the fusion of neural networks—both biological and artificial—with the Free Energy Principle (FEP), a theoretical framework that explains how adaptive systems maintain stability by minimizing variational free energy. The core idea is that biological systems continually adjust their internal models to reduce the gap between expected and actual sensory inputs, a process grounded in Bayesian inference. By integrating these concepts, the research aims to create a unified model that enhances our understanding of cognitive processes and has practical applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience. Key contributions include theoretical advancements, new computational models, and innovative methodologies for exploring the relationship between neural dynamics and free energy minimization.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

The journey of artificial neural networks (ANNs) began in the 1940s, with the perceptron model. Key advancements include:

- **Backpropagation**: A method for training networks by adjusting weights based on output errors.
- **Deep Learning**: Techniques that allow modeling complex data patterns.

On the biological side, neuroscience has revealed insights into how synaptic plasticity and neural coding work.

#### Free Energy Principle

The FEP, rooted in thermodynamics, gained traction in cognitive science through the work of Friston. It suggests that biological systems minimize surprise or prediction error, leading to concepts like:

- **Predictive Processing**: The brain continuously updates its mental model of the world.
- **Active Inference**: Agents take actions to fulfill predictions, minimizing free energy.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neural Networks

Recent developments in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision. However, issues like interpretability and generalization in dynamic environments remain.

#### Free Energy Principle

Research on FEP has expanded to include social cognition and decision-making, yet the integration with neural networks is still underexplored.
