## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks in Cognitive Science and Machine Learning

Neural networks have been foundational in understanding brain functions and are now powerful tools in machine learning, helping with tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. Concepts like Hebbian learning (where connections strengthen when neurons are activated together) and reinforcement learning (learning from outcomes) are crucial in both biological and artificial systems.

#### Evolution of Guest Experience Theories in Hospitality Management

Guest experience theories have shifted from focusing solely on service quality to emphasizing personalization and emotional engagement, especially with the integration of digital tools. This evolution raises questions about how to merge these frameworks with emerging technologies like neural networks.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Advancements in Neural Network Applications

Neural networks are now used in various industries for tasks like diagnostics in healthcare and algorithmic trading in finance. Their ability to process large datasets and identify patterns is crucial for informed decision-making.

#### Trends in Guest Experience Management

Personalization and technology are key trends in hospitality. Data analytics allows businesses to tailor services to individual preferences, making it essential for providers to proactively anticipate guest needs.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements, there’s a gap in interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience with hospitality. This dissertation aims to bridge that gap by identifying data-driven opportunities to enhance service delivery.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Personalization | Enhanced guest satisfaction and loyalty                     | Development of tailored service offerings                  |
| Improved Staff Training    | More effective communication and collaboration among staff | Enhanced service delivery through teamwork                  |
| Data-Driven Decision Making | Greater operational efficiency and responsiveness           | Adoption of analytics for real-time service adjustments      |

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Key Neural Network Theories

Theories like Hebbian learning and reinforcement learning provide a basis for understanding how interconnected systems adapt. These can model guest interactions, suggesting that hospitality businesses can learn from past experiences to improve future service.

#### Service Quality and Experience Theories in Hospitality

Service quality theories, such as SERVQUAL, identify key dimensions influencing guest satisfaction. These can be mapped onto neural network principles, offering a framework for optimizing service quality.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Development of the "Guest Experience Neural Model"

This model synthesizes neural network concepts with guest experience theories, positing that guest interactions are like interconnected nodes that process and respond to data. This framework can be tested empirically.

#### Neural Plasticity and Service Adaptation Strategies

Neural plasticity—the ability to adapt based on experiences—offers insights into how hospitality businesses can continuously improve services based on guest feedback.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

A visual model illustrates how staff (neurons), touchpoints (synapses), and guest data (neurotransmitters) interact. This model helps understand how neural network principles can inform guest experience management.

### Figure 1: Integrated Theoretical Model of Guest Experience Neural Framework

```plaintext
[Guest Data] --> [Touchpoints] --> [Staff Interaction]
       |               |                  |
       |               |                  |
   [Neurotransmitters] <-- [Service Adaptation] <-- [Feedback Mechanisms]
