### Literature Review

#### Historical Context of the Original Domains

**Chemical Reactions**: The study of chemical reactions has evolved from early alchemy to the sophisticated methodologies we see today. Key principles such as reaction kinetics (the speed of reactions) and thermodynamics (energy changes during reactions) are crucial for understanding how substances interact.

**Neural Networks**: Neural network theory has also progressed significantly, originating from biological neural networks to complex models capable of learning and adaptation. Early models laid the groundwork for understanding how simple units can combine to tackle complex tasks.

#### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

**Chemical Reaction Dynamics**: Modern techniques such as spectroscopy and computational chemistry allow researchers to visualize and understand molecular interactions in detail. This has led to significant advancements in areas like catalysis, where catalysts speed up reactions.

**Neuroscience**: In neuroscience, techniques like optogenetics and fMRI have transformed our ability to observe and manipulate neural activity. However, there is still a need for integrative models that capture the dynamic and often non-linear nature of neural interactions.

#### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite advancements, there are gaps in the literature where insights from one discipline could enhance the other. For example, while chemical kinetics provides robust frameworks for reaction dynamics, similar models are lacking in neuroscience. This dissertation seeks to bridge these gaps by proposing an integrative model that encompasses both chemical and neural dynamics.
