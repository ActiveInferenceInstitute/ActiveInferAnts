## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The integration of neural network concepts with ecosystem dynamics represents a transformative approach to understanding complex systems. Neural networks, whether biological (like the human brain) or artificial (used in AI), are known for their interconnectedness and ability to adapt. Ecosystems, on the other hand, are made up of interdependent species that interact with their environment, exhibiting similar adaptive behaviors. This dissertation aims to draw parallels between these two domains, revealing how ecosystems can be viewed as dynamic networks capable of learning and adapting.

Neural networks excel in tasks such as pattern recognition and adaptive learning, adjusting based on feedback. Similarly, ecosystems respond to species interactions and environmental changes, leading to shifts in community structure. By applying neural network principles, this research seeks to uncover the mechanisms that govern ecological dynamics.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This research is significant because it bridges the gap between neuroscience and ecology, offering a fresh perspective on how ecosystems function. The novelty lies in applying neural network principles to ecological systems, which could lead to new models that enhance our understanding of biodiversity and resilience.

By framing ecosystems as networks that process information and exhibit learning behaviors, this dissertation challenges traditional ecological theories. The implications are profound, potentially leading to better predictive models for ecosystem responses to environmental changes and improved conservation strategies. Furthermore, this research anticipates the emergence of interdisciplinary fields that leverage insights from both neuroscience and ecology, fostering collaborative efforts to address global environmental issues.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation is guided by the following research questions:

1. How can neural network principles be applied to understand ecosystem dynamics?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks have evolved significantly since their inception, with early models mimicking basic cognitive functions. The introduction of backpropagation algorithms in the 1980s enabled more complex architectures, leading to advancements in machine learning and AI. Recent developments in deep learning have allowed neural networks to tackle intricate tasks across various fields.

#### Ecosystem Theory

Ecological theories have also evolved, with concepts like the Gaia hypothesis and ecological succession highlighting the dynamic nature of ecosystems. Studies on biodiversity and energy flow emphasize species interdependence and their roles within ecosystems. Resilience theory, which examines an ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbances, has gained importance, especially in the context of climate change.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Theories surrounding explainable AI have emerged, emphasizing the need for transparency in neural network decision-making.

#### Ecological Studies

Current ecological research focuses on species interactions, ecosystem services, and climate change impacts on biodiversity. While significant progress has been made, integrating systemic approaches that consider the interconnectedness of species and environments remains underexplored. Recent advancements in network ecology and graph theory align well with the proposed framework of this dissertation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
