# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to Blockchain

## Executive Summary
This dissertation investigates the integration of neural network principles into blockchain technology, coining the term "Neurochain." The goal is to harness the adaptability and interconnectedness of neural networks to tackle prevalent issues in blockchain, such as scalability, energy consumption, and interoperability. The proposed framework aims to enhance decentralized systems and facilitate intelligent smart contracts that evolve by learning from historical data. This work not only contributes theoretical advancements but also offers practical applications that could transform how blockchain technology is utilized across various sectors like finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain
The Shifted Domain highlights the convergence of two powerful technologies: neural networks, which emulate the human brain's ability to learn and adapt, and blockchain, which provides a decentralized and secure way to manage transactions. This intersection opens up opportunities to create smarter, more efficient systems that address the limitations of traditional blockchain architectures.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research
This research is groundbreaking as it proposes a novel approach to blockchain functionality by applying principles from neural networks. The innovative aspect lies in creating adaptive consensus mechanisms and smart contracts that can learn from their environment, a largely unexplored area in existing literature. The implications extend beyond theory, aiming to deliver practical solutions for real-world blockchain applications.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives
1. How can neural network principles enhance blockchain functionality?
2. What new consensus mechanisms can be derived from neural plasticity?
3. How can smart contracts be designed to learn and adapt?
4. Can a multi-layer blockchain architecture improve efficiency and scalability?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains
#### Neural Networks
Neural networks have evolved significantly, starting from simple perceptrons to complex deep learning architectures. Key milestones include the introduction of backpropagation and advanced models like convolutional and recurrent neural networks, which are pivotal in various applications, including image recognition and natural language processing.

#### Blockchain
Blockchain technology began with Bitcoin, introducing decentralized ledgers for secure transactions. Despite advancements like Ethereum's smart contracts, challenges such as scalability and energy consumption persist. Solutions like layer-2 technologies and sharding have emerged, but often come with trade-offs.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields
#### Neural Networks
The methodologies in neural networks include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, but challenges such as data requirements and adversarial vulnerabilities remain. The field is increasingly focused on explainable AI (XAI) to enhance transparency.

#### Blockchain
Blockchain is exploring various consensus mechanisms, including proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), but scalability and energy issues continue to hinder widespread adoption. Newer mechanisms like proof of authority (PoA) are being investigated, yet they need further empirical validation.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain
A critical gap exists in the integration of adaptive systems within blockchain. Current systems primarily rely on static consensus and rigid smart contracts. This dissertation proposes that neural network principles can address these shortcomings, leading to more responsive and efficient decentralized systems.

## Theoretical Framework
