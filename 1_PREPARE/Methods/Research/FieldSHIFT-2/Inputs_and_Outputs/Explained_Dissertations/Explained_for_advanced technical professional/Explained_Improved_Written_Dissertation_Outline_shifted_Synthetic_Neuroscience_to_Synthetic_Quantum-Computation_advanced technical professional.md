# Explanation of the Dissertation: Transposition of Neural Networks to Quantum Computation

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the innovative intersection of **neural networks** (which simulate how the human brain learns) and **quantum computation** (which utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics). The research introduces a concept called the **"Shifted Domain,"** where methodologies from neural networks are adapted for quantum computing. The goal is to develop **quantum neural networks** that leverage unique quantum properties like **superposition** and **entanglement** to enhance learning and processing capabilities. This work could significantly impact machine learning, optimization, and data analysis across various industries.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The **Shifted Domain** merges two fields: 

1. **Neural Networks**: These are computational models inspired by the human brain. They have evolved from simple models (like perceptrons) to complex systems capable of deep learning, enabling tasks such as image recognition and language processing.

2. **Quantum Computation**: This field is based on quantum mechanics principles, using **qubits** that can represent multiple states at once (superposition). This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers.

By combining these two domains, the research aims to create quantum neural networks that could outperform traditional neural networks in specific applications.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

The significance of this research lies in its potential to create a new computational framework that merges the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks with the powerful processing abilities of quantum computers. Key concepts introduced include:

- **Quantum Synaptic Plasticity**: This refers to the ability of quantum connections (gates) to adjust their strengths based on past computations, similar to how biological synapses work.
- **Entangled Neurons**: This concept suggests that qubits can be interconnected in ways that enhance learning and information processing.

These innovations could lead to breakthroughs in efficiency and accuracy for tasks like optimization and data analysis.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can neural network principles be applied to quantum computation?
2. What effects does quantum synaptic plasticity have on learning algorithms?
3. In what ways can quantum neural networks surpass classical models?
4. What interdisciplinary frameworks can support the integration of these fields?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks have developed significantly since their inception in the 1950s. The introduction of **backpropagation** in the 1980s allowed for training multi-layer networks, leading to modern deep learning techniques widely used today.

#### Quantum Computation

Quantum computation began in the 1980s with proposals for quantum computers capable of simulating physical systems. Advances in quantum algorithms (like Shor's and Grover's) and qubit technologies have propelled the field forward, but the integration of machine learning principles into quantum computing remains limited.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

Recent advancements have improved neural networks' performance in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. In quantum computing, developments in error correction and quantum supremacy have demonstrated the potential for quantum systems to outperform classical systems. However, the intersection of these fields is still underexplored.
