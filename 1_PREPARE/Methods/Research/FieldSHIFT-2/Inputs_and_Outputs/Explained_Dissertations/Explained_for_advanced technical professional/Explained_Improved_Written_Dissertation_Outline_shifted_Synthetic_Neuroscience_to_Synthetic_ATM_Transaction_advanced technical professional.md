# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks to ATM Transactions

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates how neural networks—systems inspired by the human brain’s structure—can be integrated into Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions. The goal is to create a framework that allows ATMs to learn from user interactions, thus improving user experience and operational efficiency in banking technology. By exploring the parallels between neural networks and ATM functions, this research aims to develop adaptive ATMs that can optimize transaction processes and enhance security. The outcomes of this research could redefine the banking landscape and influence human-computer interaction across various sectors.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Neuroscience and banking technology are converging, creating opportunities to enhance automated transaction systems. Neural networks excel in learning and adapting, which contrasts sharply with the static nature of traditional ATMs. By applying neural principles, we can transform ATMs from simple cash dispensers into dynamic systems that evolve based on user behavior, addressing the limitations of conventional banking technologies.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

As customer expectations shift towards more adaptive technologies, this research addresses a critical need in banking. The novelty lies in applying neural network concepts to the rigid domain of ATMs, aiming to create machines that not only respond to user needs but anticipate them. This could lead to increased user satisfaction and operational efficiency, with implications extending beyond banking into sectors like retail and healthcare.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

1. How can neural network principles be integrated into ATM systems?
2. What effects do adaptive interfaces have on user satisfaction and transaction efficiency?
3. How can predictive algorithms enhance cash management in ATM networks?
4. How can user feedback improve the learning capabilities of adaptive ATMs?

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

Neural networks have evolved significantly since their inception in the mid-20th century. They mimic the brain’s interconnected neurons, allowing for complex pattern recognition and learning. Key advances, like the backpropagation algorithm, have made deep learning feasible, enhancing real-time applications.

#### ATM Transactions

The first ATM revolutionized banking by enabling self-service transactions. Over time, ATMs have incorporated advanced technologies but remain limited by static programming. This research identifies an opportunity to innovate by integrating adaptive systems that respond to user behavior.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent insights into neural plasticity—the brain's capacity to adapt—support the idea of systems that learn from user interactions. Concepts like Hebbian learning and spiking neural networks can inform the design of adaptive ATM systems.

#### Banking Technology

Current ATM technology emphasizes user experience, yet there’s a gap in adaptive learning systems that respond to user behavior in real-time. Applying user-centered design principles can enhance usability and accessibility.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

There’s limited interdisciplinary research connecting neuroscience with banking technology. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that integrates neural principles into ATM systems, enhancing their adaptability and user-centricity.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theories like Hebbian learning and reinforcement learning provide a foundation for understanding how systems can learn from user interactions. These theories can inform the design of adaptive ATMs that evolve based on user behavior.

#### Banking Theories

User experience theories and transaction flow models are essential for understanding how to implement adaptive ATM systems. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and transaction cost theory will be utilized to evaluate user acceptance and the economic implications of these technologies.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

The dissertation proposes viewing ATMs as adaptive learning systems, termed "Synaptic Transactions," which learn from user behavior to enhance interactions and efficiency. This model emphasizes feedback loops and adaptability.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated model will illustrate how feedback and adaptability enhance user interactions and optimize transaction processes, incorporating cognitive load theory to minimize user frustration.

## Methodology

### Research Design Overview

A mixed-methods approach will be employed, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Experimental designs will test hypotheses about adaptive interfaces, while case studies will explore real-world applications.

### Data Collection Methods

User surveys, interviews, and transaction data analysis will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of adaptive systems. Eye-tracking technology may also be used to analyze user interactions with ATM interfaces.

### Analytical Approaches

Statistical analysis will evaluate the impact of adaptive interfaces on transaction efficiency. Machine learning techniques will develop predictive algorithms for cash management, analyzing historical data to optimize ATM operations.

### Ethical Considerations

User privacy and data security are paramount. Informed consent will be obtained, and data will be anonymized to protect identities, adhering to relevant ethical guidelines.
