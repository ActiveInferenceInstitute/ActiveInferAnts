# Integrating Biological Neural Networks with Artificial Neural Networks

## Executive Summary

This dissertation investigates the integration of biological principles into artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance their functionality. By adopting concepts like **synaptic plasticity** (the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time), **neuron diversity**, and **glial support** (the role of non-neuronal cells in supporting neurons), the research aims to improve the efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability of ANNs. The implications are vast, potentially transforming fields such as healthcare and robotics by creating AI systems that learn and adapt more effectively.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The convergence of biological and artificial neural networks represents a fertile area of research. Biological neural networks, which consist of neurons connected by synapses, excel in learning and problem-solving. With around 86 billion neurons in the human brain, understanding these systems can inform the design of ANNs, prompting questions about the essence of intelligence.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

Current ANNs often struggle with issues like **overfitting** (performing well on training data but poorly on new data) and lack of interpretability. By incorporating biological principles, this research seeks to develop adaptive algorithms and neuron models that enhance performance, potentially revolutionizing AI to be more aligned with human cognitive processes.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

Key questions guiding this research include:

- How can we integrate synaptic plasticity into ANN training algorithms?
- What impact does neuron diversity have on ANN performance?
- How can glial-inspired structures enhance neural computations?

The goals are to create and validate ANN architectures that leverage these biological mechanisms to boost learning efficiency and adaptability.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Overview of Biological Neural Networks

Biological networks consist of various neuron types (e.g., sensory, motor) connected through synapses. Learning occurs through mechanisms like **long-term potentiation (LTP)** and **long-term depression (LTD)**, which strengthen or weaken synaptic connections based on neuronal activity. This understanding raises questions about replicating these processes in computational models.

#### Evolution of Artificial Neural Networks

ANNs have evolved from simple models like the perceptron to complex architectures such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Despite advancements, they still face challenges like overfitting and limited interpretability, indicating a need for innovative approaches inspired by biological learning.
