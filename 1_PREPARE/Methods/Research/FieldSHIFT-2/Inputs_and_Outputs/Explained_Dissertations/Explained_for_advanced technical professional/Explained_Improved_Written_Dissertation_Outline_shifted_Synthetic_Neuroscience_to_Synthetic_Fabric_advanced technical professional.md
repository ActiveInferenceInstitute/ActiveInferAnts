# PhD Dissertation: Transposing Neural Networks into the Fabric Industry and Arts

## Executive Summary

This dissertation explores the innovative fusion of neural networks—systems inspired by the human brain—and the fabric industry. It proposes a new framework that transforms how textiles are designed, produced, and interacted with. By applying principles from neural networks such as interconnectedness, adaptability, and feedback mechanisms, this research aims to enhance creativity, sustainability, and consumer engagement in textiles. The goal is to create fabrics that are not just functional but also emotionally and aesthetically engaging for consumers, ultimately reshaping the fabric industry to be more responsive to societal needs.

## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

Combining neural networks with textiles signifies a revolutionary change. Traditionally, textiles have been seen as static products. However, this research posits that fabrics can be dynamic, much like neural networks, which can learn and adapt. This aligns with the rise of smart textiles that respond to environmental changes, enhancing user experience. For instance, imagine a fabric that changes color based on temperature or moisture—this is the potential of integrating AI into textiles.

### Significance and Novelty of the Research

This work is significant because it merges advanced computational theories with both traditional and modern textile practices. The novelty lies in creating adaptive textiles that go beyond aesthetics. By leveraging AI, textiles could become more personalized, leading to greater consumer satisfaction and reduced waste through on-demand production. This could reshape how fabrics are designed and produced, making the industry more sustainable and consumer-focused.

### Overarching Research Questions and Objectives

The dissertation seeks to answer several key questions:
- How can neural network principles be integrated into textile design?
- What effects do adaptive textiles have on consumer satisfaction and sustainability?
- How can feedback mechanisms enhance the design process in textiles?

The research objectives include developing a framework for integrating neural networks into textile design, assessing the impact of adaptive textiles on consumer experiences, and exploring feedback's role in design improvement.
