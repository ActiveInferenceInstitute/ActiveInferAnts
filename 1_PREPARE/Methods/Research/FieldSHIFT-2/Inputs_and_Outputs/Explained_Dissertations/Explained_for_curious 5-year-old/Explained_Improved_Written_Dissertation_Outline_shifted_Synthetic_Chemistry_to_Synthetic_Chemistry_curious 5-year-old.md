Sure! Let‚Äôs imagine we‚Äôre going on a fun adventure to learn about how scientists can make the world a better place using special ideas from chemistry! 

### What‚Äôs the Big Idea? 

Imagine you have a magic box of crayons. When you mix colors, you create new ones! Scientists have a similar magic box, but instead of crayons, they have chemicals. They mix these chemicals to create things we use every day. But sometimes, mixing can make a big mess, like when you spill juice! This dissertation is about helping scientists mix chemicals in a way that makes less mess and helps our planet.

### The Adventure Begins: The Shifted Domain

Think of the "Shifted Domain" like a special playground where two groups of friends come together. One group is the traditional chemists who mix chemicals, and the other group is the eco-friendly friends who want to take care of the Earth. This playground helps them share their ideas to make better and cleaner things without wasting stuff or hurting the planet.

### Why Is This Important?

The Earth is like our big home, and we need to take care of it! This research is like a treasure map showing how scientists can use their mixing skills to create new ways to make things that are good for us and the planet. If they can do this, we can have cleaner air, less trash, and more happy animals!

### The Questions We Want to Answer

1. **How can we mix chemicals in a better way?** 
2. **What new tricks can we learn to help us waste less?**
3. **How can we work together with other friends to come up with cool ideas?**

### Learning From the Past

A long time ago, smart people like Antoine and Dmitri helped us understand how to mix chemicals. They figured out rules, just like how we have rules in games. But now, we also need to learn how to mix these chemicals in a way that‚Äôs kind to our planet. This is where the eco-friendly ideas come in!

### What‚Äôs New and Exciting?

This research is like finding a new way to play a game. It shows how we can mix old ideas with new ones to create something amazing! It‚Äôs about making sure that when we play with chemicals, we do it in a way that helps, not hurts.

### How We‚Äôre Going to Find Out

To answer our questions, scientists will do a few things:

1. **Experimenting in the Lab**: This is like a science kitchen where they try new recipes to see which ones work best.
2. **Looking at Real-Life Examples**: They‚Äôll check out how other people are already using these ideas to see what‚Äôs working.
3. **Talking to People**: They‚Äôll ask others what they think about being eco-friendly in their work.

### The Cool Stuff We‚Äôll Discover

1. **Green Catalysts**: These are like magic helpers that make chemical reactions faster without making a mess. 
2. **Closed-loop Systems**: Imagine if you could recycle your toys instead of throwing them away! This is what scientists want to do with chemicals.
3. **Energy Saving**: Just like how you turn off the lights when you leave a room, scientists want to use less energy when they mix chemicals.

### The Lessons We‚Äôll Share

The research will help everyone understand that mixing chemicals can be fun and helpful! It‚Äôs like sharing your toys with friends‚Äîwhen we work together, we can make something even better.

### Looking Ahead

In the future, scientists will keep exploring these ideas to make even more amazing discoveries. They‚Äôll team up with people from different jobs to create new ways to take care of our planet while making cool things.

### Conclusion: A Brighter Future

This research is like planting a seed for a beautiful garden. If we take care of it and help it grow, we can have a world that‚Äôs not just fun but also safe and clean for everyone! 

So, remember: every time we mix colors, or in this case, chemicals, we can choose to do it in a way that‚Äôs kind to our Earth! Isn‚Äôt that exciting? üåç‚ú® 12.054551839828491
