### Explaining a PhD Dissertation to a Curious 5-Year-Old: William Blake and Brain Connections

#### What is This All About?

Imagine if we could think about how our brains work and how stories and art connect! This special study looks at a famous artist and poet named William Blake and how his ideas are like the way our brains talk to each other. 

#### Why is This Important?

Just like how you connect the dots in a coloring book, this study shows how different ideas in Blake’s work connect to each other. By understanding these connections, we can learn more about creativity, which is like making new things with our imagination!

#### Big Questions We Want to Answer

1. How can we think about Blake's ideas like a brain?
2. How do the ideas in his art help us understand what he wanted to say?
3. What can we learn from mixing brain science and stories?

### Learning About Blake and Brains

#### Who is William Blake?

William Blake was a cool artist and poet a long time ago. He made beautiful pictures and wrote poems that talked about important ideas, like good and bad, and how we feel inside. 

#### What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is like a big web in our brains! Imagine a spider web where each spot (or node) is connected by threads (or synapses). When one spot lights up, it can make other spots light up too! In Blake’s work, we can think of his ideas as those spots on the web, all talking to each other.

### What We Want to Find Out

This study is special because it combines two things: how our brains work and how we understand stories and art. It helps us see how Blake’s work can show us more about how we think and feel.

### Looking at What Others Have Said

Many people have talked about Blake and how our brains work, but no one has really put them together like this study does. It’s like finding a new puzzle piece that fits perfectly!

### How We Will Explore This

#### Finding the Ideas

We will look at Blake’s art and poems to find the big ideas he talked about. It’s like going on a treasure hunt for special thoughts!

#### Connecting the Dots

We will also see how these ideas connect, just like how your friends' ideas can mix together when you play. 

### What We Will Discover

1. **Thematic Neurons**: These are the big ideas in Blake's work.
2. **Synaptic Connections**: This shows how those ideas talk to each other.
3. **Emotional Resonance**: This is how we feel when we look at his art or read his poems.

### How We Will Learn

We will ask people what they think and feel when they see Blake’s work. It’s like asking your friends what they feel when you share a story!

### What We Will Learn

- **Patterns in Blake’s Work**: We will see how his ideas change and connect over time.
- **How it Makes Us Feel**: We will learn how the rhythm in his poems makes us feel happy, sad, or excited!

### Why This Matters

This study helps us understand not just Blake, but also how creativity works in all of us. It’s like opening a door to a new room filled with colors and ideas!

### What’s Next?

In the future, we will keep studying how our brains and stories connect. Maybe we can even have fun workshops where we make art and share stories together!

### Conclusion

By thinking about William Blake’s work like a big, connected web in our brains, we can learn so much about creativity and how we express ourselves. This study helps us appreciate art and poetry even more!

So, remember, just like you connect the dots to make a picture, this study shows us how ideas connect in our brains and in Blake’s art! Isn’t that cool? Keep asking questions and exploring! 17.337320804595947
