**Explaining a PhD Dissertation: Quantum Computers and Neural Networks for a 5-Year-Old**

### What is This About?

Imagine you have a really smart robot friend who learns things just like you do. This robot uses something called a **neural network**, which is like a big web of tiny lights (neurons) that help it learn and make decisions. Now, there’s a super cool type of computer called a **quantum computer** that can do things much faster and in a different way than regular computers. This dissertation is like a big adventure story about how we can combine these two amazing things—neural networks and quantum computers—to make our robot friend even smarter!

### The Big Idea: The Shifted Domain

Think of the **Shifted Domain** like a magical playground where both neural networks and quantum computers can play together. Just like how you learn new things by playing and exploring, our robot friend can learn better by using both of these powerful tools.

### Why is This Important?

This research is important because it could help us create new types of smart machines that can solve problems much faster than before. Imagine a robot that can help doctors find out how to make people feel better or help us find the best way to get to a fun place without getting stuck in traffic!

### Questions We Want to Answer

1. How can we teach our quantum computer to think like a neural network?
2. What happens when we let our quantum computer learn in a new way?
3. Can our super-smart robot do better than regular robots in some tasks?
4. How can different scientists work together to make this happen?

### Learning About Neural Networks

Neural networks are like a big team of tiny helpers in our robot’s brain. They learn from everything around them, like how you learn from your toys and games. Over the years, these helpers have gotten better and better at learning things like recognizing pictures or understanding words.

### Learning About Quantum Computers

Now, quantum computers are like magic computers that can do many things at once! They use special bits called **qubits** that can be both on and off at the same time, like spinning a coin where it’s both heads and tails until you catch it. This helps them solve tricky problems much faster than regular computers.

### What’s New in Our Research?

This research is like a treasure map that shows us how to mix the magic of quantum computers with the smart learning of neural networks. We want to create something called **quantum neural networks**, which means our robot can learn even better by using the special powers of quantum computers.

### How We Will Explore This

1. **Designing Our Robot’s Brain**: We will think about how to build the robot’s brain using both neural networks and quantum circuits.
2. **Learning to Adapt**: Just like you get better at riding a bike the more you practice, we want our robot to learn better by adjusting itself based on what it has learned.
3. **Making Smart Learning Rules**: We will create new rules that help our robot learn in the best way possible.

### What Will We Find Out?

We will test our robot to see if it can learn faster and better than regular robots. We’ll check how well it can solve problems and learn new things.

### Why Does This Matter?

This research can help many people! For example, it can help doctors make better decisions, help businesses run smoother, and even help scientists discover new things. It’s like giving our robot friend superpowers!

### What’s Next?

In the future, we want to keep exploring how to make our robots even smarter. We’ll work with scientists from different fields, like brain experts and computer wizards, to discover new ways to use our findings.

### Conclusion

By mixing the learning power of neural networks with the magic of quantum computers, we can create smarter robots that can help us in amazing ways. This research is like opening a door to a new world of possibilities, where our robot friends can learn and help us solve big problems!

### Encouragement to Explore
