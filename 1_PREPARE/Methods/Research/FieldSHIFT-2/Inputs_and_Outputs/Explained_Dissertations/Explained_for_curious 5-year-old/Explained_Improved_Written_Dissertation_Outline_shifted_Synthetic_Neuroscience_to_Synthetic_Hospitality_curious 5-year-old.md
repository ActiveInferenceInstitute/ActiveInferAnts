### Explaining the Dissertation: Making Guests Happy Like a Super Smart Brain!

**Hello there! Today, we’re going to talk about a really cool project where someone studied how to make people who stay in hotels feel super happy—just like how our brains work! Let’s dive in!**

---

## What Is This Project About?

Imagine if our brains were like a computer that helps us learn and remember things. This project is all about using ideas from how our brains work to make sure guests in hotels have the best time ever! The smart person who did this project wants to help hotels understand what guests want, so they can make their stay special and fun.

---

## Why Is This Important?

This project is special because it shows how we can mix two things: the way our brains learn (like when you remember your favorite toy) and how hotels can help guests feel happy. When hotels use these smart ideas, they can make their services better, just like how you feel when you get your favorite ice cream!

## Questions We Want to Answer

Here are some big questions the project is trying to answer:

1. **How can understanding brains help hotels make guests happier?**
2. **How can hotel workers learn to help guests better?**
3. **How can hotels use what they know about guests to make their stay even more fun?**

## Learning from Others

### How Brains Work

Our brains have special parts called neurons that talk to each other to help us think and learn. Just like when you play with blocks and build something new, these neurons help us make connections and learn new things!

### How Guests Feel in Hotels

Hotels want to make sure guests feel good, like when you have a fun day at the park. They learn what guests like and how to make their stay better, just like how you learn what games your friends enjoy!

---

## New Ideas from the Project

### The "Guest Experience Neural Model"

Think of this as a map that shows how hotel workers can connect with guests, just like how neurons connect in our brains. When hotel staff understand guests better, they can make their stay even more special!

### Learning and Changing

Just like how you learn from your mistakes (like when you fall while running), hotels can learn from guest feedback to improve their services. If a guest says they didn’t like something, the hotel can change it for next time!

---

## How We Will Find Out More

### Talking to People

The smart person will ask guests and hotel workers questions to learn about their experiences. It’s like when you ask your friends what games they like to play!

### Looking at Feedback

They will also look at what guests have said in the past. This is like reading notes from your friends to see what they enjoyed!

---

## Key Parts of the Project

### Teamwork in Hotels

Just like how you work with your friends to build a big tower of blocks, hotel workers need to work together to help guests. When everyone helps, guests feel happy!

### Listening to Guests

Hotels need to listen to what guests say, just like how your parents listen to you when you tell them about your day. This helps hotels know what to do better next time!

### Using Guest Information

Hotels can collect special information about what guests like, just like how you remember your friend’s favorite snack. This helps them make each visit more personal and fun!

---

## What Happens Next?

### Helping Hotels Get Better

The project will give hotels ideas on how to use these smart brain concepts to make their services better. They will learn to be like superheroes for their guests!

### Making Sure Guests Are Happy

The project will also help create rules to keep guests' information safe, just like how you keep your secret treasures safe!

---

## Future Ideas

### Trying New Things

The smart person will suggest trying out these ideas in different hotels to see how well they work. It’s like a fun experiment to see what makes guests smile the most!

### Working Together

There’s a chance for the smart person to work with other experts to make even better ideas in the future. Imagine teaming up with friends to create the best game ever!
