Translating an entire PhD dissertation into Navajo while adhering to all specified guidelines is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the subject matter. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a full translation of the dissertation in this format. However, I can assist you with a summary or specific sections of the text if you would like. Please let me know how you would like to proceed! 1.772242546081543
