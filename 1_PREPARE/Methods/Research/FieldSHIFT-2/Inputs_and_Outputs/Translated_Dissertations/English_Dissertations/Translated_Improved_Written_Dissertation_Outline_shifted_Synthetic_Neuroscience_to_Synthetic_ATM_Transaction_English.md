## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

The development of neural networks can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with foundational theories proposed by researchers such as McCulloch and Pitts (1943) and later advancements by Rosenblatt (1958) with the Perceptron model. Neural networks are designed to mimic the human brain's interconnected neuron structure, allowing for complex pattern recognition and learning through experience. Key theorists such as Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams (1986) advanced the backpropagation algorithm, which enabled deeper networks to learn effectively. Recent innovations in deep learning and reinforcement learning have further enhanced the capabilities of neural networks, making them increasingly relevant in real-time applications.

#### ATM Transactions

The first Automated Teller Machine (ATM), introduced in the late 1960s, revolutionized banking by allowing customers to perform basic transactions without the need for human tellers. Over the decades, ATMs have evolved significantly, incorporating advanced technologies such as card readers, cash dispensers, and touch screens. The evolution of user interaction paradigms has shifted from simple transaction interfaces to more sophisticated systems that aim to enhance user experience through personalization and convenience. However, the inherent limitations of static programming in traditional ATMs have resulted in a lack of responsiveness to user behavior, creating an opportunity for innovation through adaptive systems.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neuroscience

Recent advancements in neuroscience have deepened our understanding of neural plasticity, the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This concept is crucial in the context of adaptive systems, as it supports the idea that systems can learn and evolve based on user interactions. Furthermore, research into network dynamics and feedback mechanisms has highlighted the importance of real-time data processing and adaptive learning in enhancing system performance. The integration of concepts such as Hebbian learning and spiking neural networks into the design of adaptive systems can provide a robust theoretical foundation for the proposed framework.

#### Banking Technology

Current trends in ATM technology emphasize the importance of user experience design, with a focus on creating intuitive interfaces that cater to diverse user needs. Innovations such as contactless transactions, mobile banking integration, and enhanced security protocols are reshaping the landscape of banking technology. However, there remains a gap in the integration of adaptive learning systems that can respond to user behavior and preferences in real-time. The application of user-centered design principles and cognitive load theory can further inform the development of adaptive interfaces that enhance usability and accessibility.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The literature reveals a lack of interdisciplinary research connecting neuroscience with banking technology. While both fields have made significant advancements independently, limited exploration of adaptive systems in ATM design presents an opportunity for innovation. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework that integrates neural network principles into ATM transaction systems, thereby enhancing their adaptability and user-centricity. The potential for creating a feedback-rich environment that fosters continuous learning and improvement in ATM systems will be a focal point of this research.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Neuroscience Theories

Key theories from neuroscience, such as Hebbian learning—which posits that "cells that fire together, wire together"—and connectionism, provide a basis for understanding how neural networks learn and adapt. These theories emphasize the importance of experience and feedback in shaping network behavior, which can be applied to the design of adaptive ATM systems. Additionally, the concept of reinforcement learning, where systems learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, will be integrated into the proposed framework to enhance ATM responsiveness.

#### Banking Theories

User experience theories, transaction flow models, and security frameworks form the backbone of banking technology. Theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) offer insights into the factors influencing user acceptance of new technologies, which is critical when implementing adaptive ATM systems. Furthermore, transaction cost theory can provide a lens through which to assess the economic implications of implementing adaptive technologies in banking operations.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

This research proposes the conceptualization of ATMs as adaptive learning systems informed by neural principles. The framework for "Synaptic Transactions" suggests that ATMs can learn from user behavior and adjust their functionalities accordingly. This new theoretical construct emphasizes the importance of feedback loops and adaptability in enhancing user interactions and transaction efficiency. By conceptualizing user interactions as synaptic connections, the research aims to create a model that reflects the dynamic nature of user engagement with ATMs.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

An integrated theoretical model combining neural network dynamics with ATM transaction flows will be developed. This model will illustrate how feedback loops and adaptability can enhance user interactions, optimize transaction processes, and improve overall system performance. The model will also incorporate elements of cognitive load theory, ensuring that the design of adaptive interfaces minimizes user frustration and enhances satisfaction.
