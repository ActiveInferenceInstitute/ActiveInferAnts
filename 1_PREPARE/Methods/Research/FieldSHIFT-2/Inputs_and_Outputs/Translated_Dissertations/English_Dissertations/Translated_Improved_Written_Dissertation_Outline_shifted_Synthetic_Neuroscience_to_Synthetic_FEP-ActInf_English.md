## Introduction

### Background of the Shifted Domain

The Shifted Domain represents the integration of neural networks—both biological and artificial—with the Free Energy Principle, a theoretical framework that describes how adaptive systems maintain their integrity by minimizing variational free energy. The Free Energy Principle posits that biological systems strive to minimize the discrepancy between their predictions of sensory inputs and the actual sensory inputs they receive. This approach can be represented mathematically and is deeply rooted in Bayesian inference and statistical mechanics. By merging this principle with neural network dynamics, we can gain insights into cognitive processes that are inherently predictive and adaptive.

## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Neural Networks

The development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be traced back to the 1940s, with the introduction of the perceptron by Rosenblatt (1958). This early model laid the groundwork for understanding how simple units could learn to classify inputs. Over the decades, advancements such as backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986) and the introduction of deep learning architectures have revolutionized the field, allowing for the modeling of complex patterns in data. Biological neural networks, on the other hand, have been studied extensively through the lens of neuroscience, revealing insights into synaptic plasticity, neural coding, and the brain's hierarchical organization.

#### Free Energy Principle

The Free Energy Principle has its roots in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, gaining prominence in cognitive science through the works of Friston (2009). The principle posits that biological systems act to minimize free energy, which can be interpreted as the surprise or prediction error in Bayesian terms. This framework has been applied to various cognitive processes, emphasizing the role of predictive coding and active inference in perception and action.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Neural Networks

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown remarkable success in modeling temporal and spatial patterns in data. However, challenges remain in understanding the interpretability and generalization capabilities of these models, particularly in dynamic environments.

#### Free Energy Principle

Current research on the Free Energy Principle has expanded its application beyond traditional cognitive tasks to include social cognition, decision-making, and even psychopathology. The principles of predictive coding and active inference have been utilized to explain how agents interact with their environment, continually updating their beliefs based on new information. However, a comprehensive integration with neural networks remains largely unexplored.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

The integration of neural networks and the Free Energy Principle presents several gaps in existing literature. For instance, while both fields emphasize adaptation and learning, the mechanisms through which neural networks can embody the principles of predictive coding and active inference require further investigation. Additionally, the hierarchical organization of neural networks offers a promising avenue for optimizing free energy minimization across cognitive levels, which has yet to be thoroughly examined.

| Gap in Literature                        | Opportunity for Research                                   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of integration between fields       | Develop a unified model incorporating both domains        |
| Limited understanding of predictive coding in neural networks | Explore neural dynamics in the context of FEP |
| Insufficient exploration of hierarchical processing | Investigate optimization of free energy minimization across cognitive levels |
