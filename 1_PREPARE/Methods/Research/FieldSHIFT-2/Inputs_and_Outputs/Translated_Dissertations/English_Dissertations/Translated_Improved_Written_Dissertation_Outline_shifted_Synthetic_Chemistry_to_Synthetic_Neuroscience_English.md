## Literature Review

### Historical Context of the Original Domains

#### Chemical Reactions

The study of chemical reactions has a rich history, advancing from early alchemical practices to the rigorous methodologies of modern chemistry. Key principles such as reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, and catalysis have been instrumental in understanding how substances interact and transform. Pioneers like Antoine Lavoisier and Dmitri Mendeleev laid the groundwork for understanding chemical identities and behaviors, while later advancements in quantum chemistry have provided deeper insights into molecular interactions.

#### Neural Networks

Neural network theory has evolved significantly since the early days of artificial intelligence. Initially inspired by biological neural networks, early models like the perceptron laid the groundwork for understanding how simple units can combine to solve complex problems. As our understanding of biological processes has deepened, so too have the models. Contemporary approaches incorporate insights from cognitive neuroscience, leading to sophisticated architectures capable of learning and adaptation.

### Current State of Knowledge in Both Fields

#### Chemical Reaction Dynamics

Current methodologies in studying chemical reactions involve advanced techniques such as spectroscopy, chromatography, and computational chemistry. Researchers are now able to visualize reaction pathways and understand the energetics involved in reactions at a molecular level. This has led to significant advancements in catalysis, where the role of catalysts in accelerating reactions is well documented.

#### Neuroscience

In neuroscience, significant strides have been made in understanding neural circuits, synaptic plasticity, and learning mechanisms. Techniques such as optogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revolutionized our ability to observe and manipulate neural activity in real time. However, there remains a need for integrative models that can account for the dynamic and often non-linear nature of neural interactions.

### Gaps and Opportunities Presented by the Shifted Domain

Despite the advancements in both fields, there are notable gaps in the literature where cross-disciplinary insights could lead to significant advancements. For instance, while chemical kinetics provides a robust framework for understanding reaction dynamics, similar models are lacking in neuroscience. This dissertation aims to fill these gaps by proposing an integrative model that encompasses both chemical and neural dynamics.

## Theoretical Framework

### Foundational Theories from Original Domains

#### Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics

Chemical kinetics focuses on the rates of chemical reactions and the factors that influence these rates, such as temperature, concentration, and catalysts. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, deals with the energy changes associated with chemical reactions, providing insights into reaction spontaneity and equilibrium. These foundational principles are crucial for understanding how chemical processes can inform neural dynamics.

#### Neural Plasticity and Learning Theories

Neural plasticity refers to the ability of neural circuits to adapt and change in response to experience. Established theories, such as Hebbian learning, emphasize the role of synaptic strength in learning and memory. Understanding these theories is essential for drawing parallels between chemical reactions and neural processes, particularly in the context of adaptation and learning.

### New Theoretical Constructs Emerging from the Shift

#### Neural Reactions

This dissertation proposes the conceptualization of neural processes as analogous to chemical reactions. By defining "neural reactions" as input-output transformations within neural circuits, we can apply principles from chemical kinetics to model these processes. This approach offers a fresh perspective on how information is processed and transmitted within the brain.

#### Catalytic Neurotransmitter Dynamics

Neurotransmitters can be viewed as catalysts in neural signaling, facilitating and modulating synaptic transmission. This section will explore how specific neurotransmitters influence synaptic plasticity and how their dynamics can be modeled using principles of catalysis.

### Proposed Integrated Theoretical Model

The proposed integrated theoretical model combines insights from chemical reaction dynamics with neural network theories, illustrating the parallels and interactions between the two domains. This model posits that neural circuits operate similarly to chemical systems, where neurotransmitter interactions can be understood through the lens of reaction kinetics and equilibrium states.
