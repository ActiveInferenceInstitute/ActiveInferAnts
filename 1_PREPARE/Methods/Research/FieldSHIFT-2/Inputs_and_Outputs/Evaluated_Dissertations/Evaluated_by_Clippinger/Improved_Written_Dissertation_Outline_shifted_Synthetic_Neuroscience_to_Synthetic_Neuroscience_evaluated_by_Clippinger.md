## 3. Weaknesses

### 1. Limited Empirical Validation
While the dissertation outlines a robust theoretical framework, it lacks empirical validation of the proposed models. The author mentions, “Data collection will involve gathering performance metrics from various ANN architectures,” but does not provide specific results or case studies. This absence raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed concepts. Future research should include empirical studies to validate the theoretical claims made.

### 2. Over-reliance on Biological Analogies
The dissertation heavily relies on biological analogies, which, while insightful, may not always translate effectively to computational models. For instance, the author states, “Neural plasticity theories are foundational to understanding learning processes in biological systems,” but does not sufficiently address the limitations of directly applying these theories to ANNs. A more nuanced discussion of the differences between biological and artificial systems would strengthen the argument.

### 3. Insufficient Exploration of Ethical Implications
The ethical considerations surrounding advanced AI systems are briefly mentioned but not explored in depth. The author notes, “Considerations will include the potential for bias in learning algorithms,” yet does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the ethical challenges that may arise from integrating biological principles into AI. Given my emphasis on ethical considerations in AI development, I recommend a more thorough examination of these issues.
