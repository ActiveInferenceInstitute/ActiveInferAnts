The dissertation touches on ethical considerations but lacks a comprehensive exploration of the implications of biologically inspired AI systems. Given the increasing scrutiny on AI ethics, a more in-depth discussion of potential biases, accountability, and societal impacts would enhance the work's relevance. In my research, I have emphasized the importance of ethical frameworks in AI development, which should be integral to any discussion of advanced AI systems.

### 3.3 Lack of Specificity in Proposed Algorithms

- **Quote**: "The development of training algorithms that adjust learning rates based on input frequency and timing will be examined."

While the proposal of adaptive algorithms is intriguing, the dissertation could benefit from more specific details on their implementation and expected outcomes. Clearer descriptions of how these algorithms will be operationalized would enhance the work's practical applicability. In my own work, I have found that specificity in algorithm design is crucial for facilitating understanding and adoption in the field.

### 3.4 Overemphasis on Biological Analogies

- **Quote**: "By mimicking the timing-dependent changes in synaptic strength observed in biological systems..."

While drawing analogies between biological and artificial systems is valuable, an overemphasis on biological mimicry may obscure the unique capabilities of ANNs. It is essential to recognize that while biological systems provide inspiration, they operate under different constraints and objectives. My perspective encourages a balanced approach that considers both biological insights and the distinct advantages of computational systems.

### 3.5 Insufficient Focus on Practical Applications

- **Quote**: "The potential benefits and challenges posed by AI systems that learn and adapt in human-like ways will be explored."

The dissertation mentions practical applications but does not delve deeply into how the proposed frameworks could be implemented in real-world scenarios. Greater emphasis on practical applications and case studies would enhance the work's impact. In my research, I have prioritized the translation of theoretical insights into actionable strategies, which is crucial for driving innovation in applied settings.

## 4. Contribution to the Field
