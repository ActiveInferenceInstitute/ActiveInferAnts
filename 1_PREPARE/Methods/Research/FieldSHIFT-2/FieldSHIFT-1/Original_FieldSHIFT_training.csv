We propose that this process involves dorsoventral differences in cell-cell communication through gap junctions composed of connexin proteins. Global modulation of gap junctional states in Xenopus embryos by pharmacological agents specifically induced heterotaxia involving mirror-image reversals of heart, gut, and gall bladder. Greatest sensitivity was observed between st. 5 and st. 12, well before the onset of organogenesis. Moreover, heterotaxia was also induced following microinjection of dominant negative and wild-type connexin mRNAs to modify the endogenous dorsoventral difference in junctional communication. Heterotaxia was induced by either blocking gap junction communication (GJC) dorsally or by introducing communication ventrally (but not the reverse). Both connexin misexpression and exposure to GJC-modifying drugs altered expression of the normally left-sided gene XNR-1, demonstrating that GJC functions upstream of XNR-1 in the pathway that patterns left-right asymmetry. Finally, lineage analysis to follow the progeny of microinjected cells indicated that they generally do not contribute the asymmetric organs. Together with the early sensitivity window, this suggests that GJC functions as part of a fundamental, early aspect of left-right patterning. In addition, we show that a potential regulatory mutation in Connexin43 is sufficient to cause heterotaxia. Despite uncertainty about the prevalence of the serine364 to proline substitution reported in human patients with laterality defects, the mutant protein is both a mild hypomorph and a potent antimorph as determined by the effect of its expression on left-right patterning. Taken together, our data suggest that endogenous dorsoventral differences in GJC within the early embryo are needed to consistently orient left-right asymmetry.","Invariant left-right asymmetry of the visceral organs is a fundamental feature of vertebrate embryogenesis.

But the proliferation of new cells is not sufficient; we will also need to understand how the scale and ultimate form of newly produced tissues are determined. Using the planarian model system, we report that membrane voltage-dependent bioelectric signaling determines both head size and organ scaling during regeneration. RNA interference of the H+,K+-ATPase ion pump results in membrane hyperpolarization, which has no effect on the amount of new tissue (blastema) that is regenerated yet produces regenerates with tiny ‘shrunken’ heads and proportionally oversized pharynges. Our data show that this disproportionality results from a lack of the apoptosis required to adjust head and organ size and placement, highlighting apoptotic remodeling as the link between bioelectric signaling and the establishment of organ size during regeneration.","A main goal of regenerative medicine is to replace lost or damaged tissues and organs with functional parts of the correct size and shape.

We review recent functional data on the regulation of mitosis by bioelectric signals, and the function of membrane voltage and specific potassium, sodium, and chloride ion channels in the proliferation of embryonic, somatic, and neoplastic cells. Its unique properties place this powerful, well-conserved, but still poorly-understood signaling system at the center of the coordinated cellular interactions required for complex pattern formation. Moreover, disregulation of ion channel expression and function is increasingly observed to be not only a useful marker but likely a functional element in oncogenesis.

This reluctance was based on certain philosophical mistakes, primarily the mistake of supposing that the subjectivity of consciousness made it beyond the reach of an objective science. Once we see that consciousness is a biological phenomenon like any other, then it can be investigated neurobiologically. Consciousness is entirely caused by neurobiological processes and is realized in brain structures. The essential trait of consciousness that we need to explain is unified qualitative subjectivity.","Until recently, most developmental biologists did not regard somatic consciousness as a suitable topic for scientific investigation.

Of particular interest to current regenerative medicine efforts, we review several examples that support the functional role of transmembrane potential (Vmem) in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, distinct Vmem controls are found in many cancer cell and precursor cell systems, which are known for their proliferative and differentiation capacities, respectively. Collectively, the data demonstrate that bioelectric properties can serve as markers for cell characterization and can control cell mitotic activity, cell cycle progression, and differentiation. The ability to control cell functions by modulating bioelectric properties such as Vmem would be an invaluable tool for directing stem cell behavior toward therapeutic goals. Biophysical properties of stem cells have only recently begun to be studied and are thus in need of further characterization. Understanding the molecular and mechanistic basis of biophysical regulation will point the way toward novel ways to rationally direct cell functions, allowing us to capitalize upon the potential of biophysical signaling for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering.","Biophysical signaling, an integral regulator of long-term cell behavior in both excitable and non-excitable cell types, offers enormous potential for modulation of important cell functions.

1448,"In classical computational developmental biology, transfer functions are derived from cellular recordings to derive analytical model descriptions of cellular processes. This approach has resulted in a variety of Hodgkin-Huxley-type neural models, or multi-compartment synapse models, that accurately mimic neural recordings and have transformed the neuroscience field. However, these analytical models are typically slow to compute due to their inclusion of dynamic and nonlinear properties of the underlying biological system. This drawback limits the extent to which these models can be integrated within large-scale neural simulation frameworks and hinders an uptake by the neuro-engineering field which requires fast and efficient model descriptions. To bridge this translational gap, we present a hybrid, machine-learning and computational-neuroscience approach that transforms analytical sensory neuron and synapse models into artificial-neural-network (ANN) neural units with the same biophysical properties. Our ANN-model architecture comprises parallel and differentiable equations that can be used for backpropagation in neuro-engineering applications, and offers a simulation run-time improvement factor of 70 and 280 on CPU or GPU systems respectively. We focussed our development on auditory sensory neurons and synapses, and show that our ANN-model architecture generalizes well to a variety of existing analytical models of different complexity. The model training and development approach we present can easily be modified for other neuron and synapse types to accelerate the development of large-scale brain networks and to open up avenues for ANN-based treatments of the pathological system.","In classical computational developmental biology, transfer functions are derived from cellular recordings to derive analytical model descriptions of cellular processes.

We describe the expression patterns of three genes involved in LR determination in chick embryos: activin receptor IIa, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and cNR-1 (related to the mouse gene nodal). These genes are expressed asymmetrically during and after gastrulation and regulate the expression of one another in a sequential pathway. Moreover, manipulation of the sidedness of either activin protein or Shh expression alters heart situs. Together, these observations identify a cascade of molecular asymmetry that determines morphological LR asymmetry in the chick embryo.","While significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular events underlying the early specification of the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, little information is available regarding the cellular or molecular basis for left-right (LR) differences in animal morphogenesis.

1599,"Recently, a pathway of genes which are part of a cascade regulating the side on which the heart forms during chick development was characterized (M. Levin et al., 1995, Cell 82, 1-20). Here we extend these previous studies, showing that manipulation of at least one member of the cascade, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), can affect the situs of embryonic rotation and of the gut, in addition to the heart. Bilateral expression of Shh, which is normally found exclusively on the left, does not result in left isomerism (a bilaterally symmetrical embryo having two left sides) nor in a complete situs inversus phenotype. Instead, misexpression of Shh on the right side of the node, which in turn leads to bilateral nodal expression, produces a heterotaxia-like condition, where different aspects of laterality are determined independently. Heart situs has previously been shown to be altered by ectopic Shh and activin. However, the most downstream gene identified in the LR pathway, nodal, had not been functionally linked to heart laterality. We show that ectopic (right-sided) nodal expression is able to affect heart situs, suggesting that the randomization of heart laterality observed in Shh and activin misexpression experiments is a result of changes in nodal expression and that nodal is likely to regulate heart situs endogenously. The first defined asymmetric signal in the left-right patterning pathway is Shh, which is initially expressed throughout Hensen's node but becomes restricted to the left side at stage 4(+). It has been hypothesized that the restriction of Shh expression may be due to repression by an upstream activin-like factor. The involvement of such an activin-like factor on the right side of Hensen's node was suggested because ectopic activin protein is able to repress Shh on the left side of the node, as well as to induce ectopic expression of a normally right-sided marker, the activin receptor cAct-RIIa. Here we provide further evidence in favor of this model. We find that a member of this family, Activin betaB, is indeed expressed asymmetrically, only on the right side of Hensen's node, at the correct time for it to be the endogenous asymmetric activin signal.","Recently, a pathway of genes which are part of a cascade regulating the side on which the heart forms during chick development was characterized (M.

1602,"Alongside the well-known chemical modes of cell-cell communication, we find an important and powerful system of bioelectrical signaling: changes in the resting voltage potential (Vmem) of the plasma membrane driven by ion channels, pumps and gap junctions. Slow Vmem changes in all cells serve as a highly conserved, information-bearing pathway that regulates cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. In embryonic and regenerative pattern formation and in the disorganization of neoplasia, bioelectrical cues serve as mediators of large-scale anatomical polarity, organ identity and positional information. Recent developments have resulted in tools that enable a high-resolution analysis of these biophysical signals and their linkage with upstream and downstream canonical genetic pathways. Here, we provide an overview for the study of bioelectric signaling, focusing on state-of-the-art approaches that use molecular physiology and developmental genetics to probe the roles of bioelectric events functionally. We highlight the logic, strategies and well-developed technologies that any group of researchers can employ to identify and dissect ionic signaling components in their own work and thus to help crack the bioelectric code. The dissection of bioelectric events as instructive signals enabling the orchestration of cell behaviors into large-scale coherent patterning programs will enrich on-going work in diverse areas of biology, as biophysical factors become incorporated into our systems-level understanding of cell interactions.","Alongside the well-known chemical modes of cell-cell communication, we find an important and powerful system of bioelectrical signaling: changes in the resting voltage potential (Vmem) of the plasma membrane driven by ion channels, pumps and gap junctions.

The body is a complex system that is capable of processing information from the environment and using this information to guide morphogenesis in relation to hardwired patterning programs. Developmental biology has unravelled processes of how environmental information can be collected, transmitted centrally, processed, and utilised to modify effective morphogenesis in relation to receptors. Extensive sampling of cellular activity during rich proto-cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of body function and receptors."

1596,"Embryonic morphogenesis occurs along three orthogonal axes. While the patterning of the anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral axes has been increasingly well characterized, the left–right (LR) axis has only recently begun to be understood at the molecular level. The mechanisms which ensure invariant LR asymmetry of the heart, viscera, and brain represent a thread connecting biomolecular chirality to human cognition, along the way involving fundamental aspects of cell biology, biophysics, and evolutionary biology. An understanding of LR asymmetry is important not only for basic science, but also for the biomedicine of a wide range of birth defects and human genetic syndromes. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding LR patterning in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate species, discusses several poorly understood but important phenomena, and highlights some important open questions about the evolutionary origin and conservation of mechanisms underlying embryonic asymmetry.","Embryonic morphogenesis occurs along three orthogonal axes.
