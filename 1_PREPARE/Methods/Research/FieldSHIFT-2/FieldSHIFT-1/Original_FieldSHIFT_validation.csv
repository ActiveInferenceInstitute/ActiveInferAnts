Sensitivity to the external pH is a common feature of all living cells, but is greatly amplified during the neuron's action potential. Synchronization of the action potentials of the same neurons that are involved in cognitive binding is the likely mechanism by which the sentience of individual neurons is coordinated into the brain-level phenomenon of subjective awareness. I conclude that a proper understanding of the permeability of the neural membrane during the action potential is as important for consciousness studies as is a proper understanding of synaptic transmission for the explication of cognition.","Such openness to the extracellular world is arguably the protophenomenon of cellular ""sentience,"" literally, feeling the charge-state of the electrochemical environment.

1602,"Alongside the well-known chemical modes of cell-cell communication, we find an important and powerful system of bioelectrical signaling: changes in the resting voltage potential (Vmem) of the plasma membrane driven by ion channels, pumps and gap junctions. Slow Vmem changes in all cells serve as a highly conserved, information-bearing pathway that regulates cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. In embryonic and regenerative pattern formation and in the disorganization of neoplasia, bioelectrical cues serve as mediators of large-scale anatomical polarity, organ identity and positional information. Recent developments have resulted in tools that enable a high-resolution analysis of these biophysical signals and their linkage with upstream and downstream canonical genetic pathways. Here, we provide an overview for the study of bioelectric signaling, focusing on state-of-the-art approaches that use molecular physiology and developmental genetics to probe the roles of bioelectric events functionally. We highlight the logic, strategies and well-developed technologies that any group of researchers can employ to identify and dissect ionic signaling components in their own work and thus to help crack the bioelectric code. The dissection of bioelectric events as instructive signals enabling the orchestration of cell behaviors into large-scale coherent patterning programs will enrich on-going work in diverse areas of biology, as biophysical factors become incorporated into our systems-level understanding of cell interactions.","Alongside the well-known chemical modes of cell-cell communication, we find an important and powerful system of bioelectrical signaling: changes in the resting voltage potential (Vmem) of the plasma membrane driven by ion channels, pumps and gap junctions.
