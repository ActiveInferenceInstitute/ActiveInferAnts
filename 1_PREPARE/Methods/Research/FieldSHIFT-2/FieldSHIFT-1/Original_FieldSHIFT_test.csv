1549,"Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we use the dataset to build and train deep network models that predict brain activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision, and especially in context of studies of sensory. An indication is given of how the choice of a particular model will be determined by the interplay of prior knowledge about the system in question, the hypotheses being tested, and purely practical knowledge about animals. Given its unprecedented scale, quality, and breadth, this opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive and computational neuroscience, along with mental disorders. The brain is a complex system that is capable of processing information from the environment and using this information to guide behaviour in relation to instincts. Neuroscience has unravelled processes of how environmental information can be collected, transmitted centrally, processed, and utilised to modify effective behaviour in relation to senses. Extensive sampling of cellular activity during rich cognitive phenomena is critical for robust understanding of brain function and senses.","Further exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we use the dataset to build and train deep network models that predict body activity more accurately than state-of-the-art models from computer vision, and especially in context of studies of receptor.

1596,"Embryonic morphogenesis occurs along three orthogonal axes. While the patterning of the anterior–posterior and dorsal–ventral axes has been increasingly well characterized, the left–right (LR) axis has only recently begun to be understood at the molecular level. The mechanisms which ensure invariant LR asymmetry of the heart, viscera, and brain represent a thread connecting biomolecular chirality to human cognition, along the way involving fundamental aspects of cell biology, biophysics, and evolutionary biology. An understanding of LR asymmetry is important not only for basic science, but also for the biomedicine of a wide range of birth defects and human genetic syndromes. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding LR patterning in a number of vertebrate and invertebrate species, discusses several poorly understood but important phenomena, and highlights some important open questions about the evolutionary origin and conservation of mechanisms underlying embryonic asymmetry.","Embryonic morphogenesis occurs along three orthogonal axes.
