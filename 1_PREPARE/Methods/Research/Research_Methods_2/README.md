## Research Methods Version 2

This document outlines the second iteration of research methodologies, building upon the concepts explored in the `./Research_Methods/` directory. The objective is to present these methodologies in a more generalized, comprehensible, and applicable manner.

### Abstracted and Generalized Methods (with Rationale for Improvement)

Enhanced handling of combinatorics and prompt schema:
Currently, we have Entities, Grants, and Catechisms, and are concatenating them in a single way. We need to handle a broader range of elements, select combinations/orderings of them, sub-sample/filter them, and use different prompt schemas (e.g., Grant_Summary+Entity to assess Relevance, Full_Grant_Call to summarize a grant, Entity and review flexibility) while maintaining interpretability in a more efficient manner than long file names, and continually exporting to detailed text files.

1. **Linguistic Meta-Analysis Across a Directory**:
    - Current State: Distinct scripts exist for the meta-analysis of Pre-Pro-Grants, Pro-Grants, and Pro-Grant reviews.
    - Improvement Goal: Develop a unified script capable of processing a directory of text files and generating a comprehensive meta-analysis output. This will streamline the process and enhance efficiency.

2. **Enhanced and Flexible LLM Interactions**:
    - Current State: The OpenAI API call method is implemented separately in the Pro-Grant writing and review scripts.
    - Improvement Goal: Create a single script that can process a directory of text files (prompts) and produce a directory with the LLM-processed text files. This will provide clearer and more flexible LLM interactions, improving usability and consistency.

3. **Implement the FieldSHIFT Paper Method from Scratch**:
    - Goal: Develop a script that implements the FieldSHIFT methodology as described in the `FieldSHIFT_prompt.md` file. This script should take a neuroscience text as input and translate it into developmental biology terminology, maintaining the underlying concepts and relationships.
    - Rationale: Implementing the FieldSHIFT method will enable the exploration of cross-disciplinary analogies and the generation of novel hypotheses in developmental biology based on neuroscience research.

4. **Support for Various Document Schemas and Formats**:
    - Goal: Extend the existing scripts to handle different types of document schemas and formats, such as single paragraphs, single pages, sub-sections, etc. This will involve developing methods to parse and process these different formats consistently.
    - Rationale: Supporting various document schemas and formats will increase the flexibility and applicability of the research methodologies, allowing them to be used with a wider range of input data and generating outputs tailored to specific requirements.

### Feature Extensions
- Incorporate flexible linguistic features abstracted from the LLM substrate, such as: Extend_Length, Professionalize, Review, Translate, Summarize, Make_Into_Table, Make_Section/Paper_Outline, Write_From_Outline, etc.
- Include access to and incorporation of external knowledge bases, such as scientific papers or API calls, especially for specific and technical information.
- Support for various input/output formats, including visual and auditory.
- Comprehensive FAQ, Q&A, methods documentation, and accessibility features.
