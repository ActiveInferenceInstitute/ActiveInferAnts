Chapter 3

  * The things are organized into categories based on similarities and differences. That organization points to a hierarchy of complexity. In this chapter, we will propose an ontology of systemness that accounts for the organization. We say “an” ontology because there have been many attempts throughout human history to establish such an organization. This chapter focuses on an ontology that is guided in formation by the principles of systems science covered in the last chapter. Again, this is not a frst such attempt. We will acknowledge a few more recent attempts in this chapter but will not present a history of the developments in ontology as this can be found in many sources.
  * We start the chapter making such commitments at the most fundamental level of existence and then derive all else from there.
  * We call it “Ontogenesis” and describe the mechanisms (like variation, combination, emergence, and selection) that generate new things and new levels of organization.
  * 3.1 — Ontology is the study of what exists.
  * We will be using concepts from a feld of mathematics called category theory. However, we will not delve into the more arcane aspects of the feld. In Chap. 4, we will be developing a mathematical description of systems using set and graph theories. Those familiar with category theory will grasp the derivations. Our position, for the present, is that category theory is a little “too” abstract for the development of a theory that can be grasped by the average reader for whom this book is intended—for readers interested in knowing how to apply category theory to the structures we will be exploring.
  * The concept of “an” ontology is adopted in the feld of information science primarily for the purpose of categorization and logical linking as in the above example of “is-a-kind-of.”
    * Comment — this is only a certain kind of declarative ontology (e.g. that make claims about what is a part, or type, or some other thing). We can contrast this approach, with the logical Ontology approach taken by Adam Pease in the SUMO project https://www.ontologyportal.org/ .
  * Basically, we assert that the language/ ontological representations need to be a hybrid between algorithmic computation and natural language so that the ideas of systemness can move freely between the world of computer simulations and human understanding — Agreed with this. 
  * The first is what we will call the “category” of things. Categories are abstract types of things. A common example of categories is the phylogenetic tree of life. The binomial nomenclature method of naming species is predicated on a hierarchy of types. We humans are a type of primate. Primates are a type of mammal, and so on. 
  * 3.1.1 Categories and Type Hierarchies
    * The terms category and type are somewhat interchangeable with caution.
  * 3.1.2 Recurring Patterns at All Scales
  * 3.1.3 Origins of Things: A Universal Process
  * 3.2 What Is “a” System Ontology, and Why Does It Matter?
    * We have claimed that systemness, the “property” of being a system, as described by the 12 principles in Chap. 2 and to be formally defined in the next chapter, is the fundamental organizing principle of the Universe.
    * As one way to see how this claim comes about, we will describe the process of auto-organization of smaller, simpler system objects into larger, more complex systems with emergent properties and behaviors.
    * If the concepts being explored by cosmology and quantum physics are reasonably close to reality, then the cycle would seem to “start” at some fundamental scale (the Planck scale?) of space and time with pre-particle entities (Unger and Smolin 2015)....For our purposes we will need to assume that something like this had to have happened to get the whole process started
    * The main topic of this book is the description and explanation of a methodology (set of methods) that can be used to acquire knowledge of how things in the Universe work. Further claimed is that this methodology rests on understanding “things” as systems, that systems interact with other systems and in doing so form a larger, encompassing supra-system, that systems are composed of subsystems (down to an atomistic level), and that this hierarchical structure encompasses everything from the Universe as a whole (closed) system down to the uncountable number of fundamental particles and energy packets that have auto-organized to form the complexity of the Universe that we (as systems that can contain models of other systems) observe in the present.
    * The claim(s) thus made is (are) unprovable and, more importantly, un-falsifable as it (they) stand. This puts the whole issue of systemness into the realm of philosophy, metaphysics, as a starting point. 
    * Systems science begins at the point where falsifability of hypotheses becomes possible. That is after we have established a set of “axioms”13 generated from the claim of systemness and then set out to test whether this or that aspect of a specifc system of interest (SOI) fails, upon proper testing, to be falsifed. The program for generating axioms from the principles of systemness is beyond the scope of this work. However, we do need to ground the rest of the book in a philosophical treatment to show the justifcations for what follows.
  * 3.2.1 System Philosophy
    * In this chapter, we will develop a set of terms that cover objects, relations, actions, transformations, quantifcations, and categorizations that constitute at least a beginning of a system ontology.
    * One of the reviewers of an earlier draft of this chapter introduced the author to a more universal approach to an upper ontology, the General Formal Ontology (GFO). After a review of its approach it appears that there are many aspects of GFO that map to the system ontology developed here. It is certainly conceivable that both approaches have many aspects in common because both are attempts to find the ultimate nature of what exists. One substantive difference, however, is that the GFO started out with an assumption of formality, using first-order logic. The system ontology presented in this chapter started with an assumption that imposing such a formality too soon might foreclose the exploration of interesting ideas that cannot be immediately captured in a formal language of that sort. The use of formalism (set and graph theories) in the next chapter is used primarily to capture descriptions of systemness without the restrictions imposed by an axiomatic system. We believe that at some point such a system will be developed but hope it will be after there is a broad understanding of the general terrain.
      * Yes. SUMO is a development from GFO, because SUMO enables higher-order reflexive/recursive logic. Thus from my understanding SUMO is the most advanced (but not most-used in large-scale data applications) ontology offering. I am excited about these directions involving Logics and Ontology, imbued with the Systems approach. And I am not sure what strategies will delay/avert the challenge of axiomatic lock-in.
  * 3.2.1.1 Metaphysics
    * Figure 3.1 image.png
    * The starting point is that the Universe is composed of matter and energy, that both come in discrete packets — Is this an evidence-supported view? And/or is this something axiomatic (taken without specific evidence), which might risk “imposing such a formality too soon might foreclose the exploration of interesting ideas”, however in the space of energy-ontologics, rather than formal ontologies? 
  * 3.2.1.2 Cosmological Ontology
    * Our metaphysical claim is that the entire Universe is comprised of these substances interacting with one another such that structures composed of matter and energy evolve toward greater organization over time through a process of auto-organization, emergence, and subsequent selection 23—a process we have dubbed ontogenesis (see below).
      * 23 — Mobus and Kalton (2015), Chaps. 10 and 11) explicate these processes as they pertain to how matter and energy interact, mediated by information to produce more complex dissipative structures that, in turn, interact at a new level of organization. The degree to which such structures are dissipative is a measure of the entity’s “knowledge” of the interaction. See also the sections below regarding ontological information and knowledge.
    * Figure 3.2 image.png
  * 3.2.1.2.1 Ontological Information
    * In this work we follow the basic insight of Shannon (Shannon and Weaver 1949) that information is the measure of uncertainty regarding the state of a message, or the next “symbol” to be received in a message stream, which is a property of the receiver (e.g., the ribosome) and not of the sender (the DNA).
    * Another mistake made in the use of the word information in common usage is to intermingle the notion of “meaning” with information.
    * The ontological status of information derives from the fact that messages have causal power to change a physical structure. This is, however, a strange kind of causal power. It is not a result of the intentions of a transmitter/sender, but rather it is based on the ignorance of the receiver.
    * Real work is accomplished in making these alterations, so energy is consumed and heat dissipated. Afterward, the structure is a priori prepared to dissipate future fows of energies without having to do additional work. Information is the capacity to cause changes in receiving systems that better prepare that system for future messages (minimize surprise). The change in the structure of the receiver that refects this preparation is what we call knowledge.
    * For sure this is consistent with the Free Energy Principle formalisms, and Bayesian Mechanics, and the work of e.g. Jim Crutchfield on thermo-informational engines. 
  * 3.2.1.2.2 Ontological Knowledge
    * According to ancient Vedic literature,31 “Richo aksare parame vyoman,” “Knowledge is structured in consciousness  (Rig Veda I.164.39  as translated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1974).” The key word here is “structured.” The theory of knowledge, ordinarily the subject of epistemology (discussed below), is rising to the level of science with the recognition that knowledge is encoded in the actual physical structures of systems,32 and thus acquires ontological status (Principle 7 in Chap. 2).
    * Figure 3.3 image.png
    * According to the Vedic tradition, this is the essence of consciousness and so everything in the Universe is conscious (see the next section on panpsychism). What we call human consciousness is just a complex version of universal consciousness. What we claim here is much less expansive. We do claim that information and knowledge, and their interactions, do have ontological status.
    * Leaving aside the nature of consciousness for the moment, we note that it is nevertheless a phenomenon of the brain.
    * In Fig. 3.2b we see some of the transformational (generation of) relations. The right side of the diagram shows that information receipt generates knowledge construction in the receiver. This means that the receiving system possessed an a priori low expectation of the messages communicated from sender to receiver. Since the “amount” of information in a message is inversely proportional to that expectation, the receiver has to respond by reconfiguring its own structure to become more dissipative (Mobus and Kalton 2015, Chap. 7). That is, it is better able to pass through the energy flows that are the result of information (perhaps through amplification) so that next time the same message is received it is less likely to cause a similar amount of change in the structure. What Fig. 3.2b shows is the iterative cycle of information–knowledge construction mediated by the roles of matter and energy
    * The pattern of message receipt and reconfiguration (even if marginal or miniscule) embodies the gaining of knowledge (even if feeting) and repeats at every level of organization in the Universe.
    * One further note, on the nature of knowledge as structural confguration; it does not generally persist. Entropy prevails in the end.
    * 3.2.1.2.3 Panpsychism
      * Recall the last section opened with a quotation from the ancient Vedic texts, the Upanishads, regarding knowledge, structure, and consciousness? There has been an on-going debate, mostly among philosophers of science but also some physicists, that consciousness is a property of the Universe, indeed probably the key property.
      * It would then be reasonable to argue that the consciousness that is so evident in living systems is actually rooted in a basic capacity of elements in the Universe to “sense” and change in accordance with what they sense.
      * How the fundamental units of reality combine and construct higher levels of organization, complexity, and capacity to construct knowledge is a central concern of ontology or ontological development, here termed ontogeny.
    * 3.2.1.3 Ontogeny: A First Pass
      * The central question here is: How do systems of increasing complexity arise out of the four (or six) fundamental substances in the frst place? In other words, where and how do systems originate and develop into their stable forms and functions? How does complexity increase over the history of the Universe?
      * The process of ontogeny is a natural consequence of the interplay between matter, energy, information, and knowledge, which is the fnal product of the process.
  * 3.2.1.4 System Epistemology
    * The bulk of this book is actually about system epistemology or more specifcally how we humans gain knowledge of systems. Using the to-be-developed ontology (this chapter) and a formal definition of system (developed in Chap. 4), we will generate an organized structure that is modifiable in the sense of learning described above.
    * This structure, which we will implement in a database, the structure of which is similar to our brains, will be predisposed to receive information about a specifc system, the system of interest, generated from the act of analysis (in the broad sense). We call this structure a knowledgebase.
    * The key to system epistemology is recognizing that the gaining and storing of knowledge in the knowledgebase is accomplished using a language of system that is completely comprehensible to human beings. In the next chapter where we develop this language, we show how the language of system is already grasped subconsciously by humans and thus becomes accessible consciously by making the nature of the language explicit through systems science and the ontology (terms) translated into a spoken language (in this case English).
  * 3.2.1.4.1 The Role of Modeling
    * All systems are initially observed from the “outside.” That is, the scientist has access to monitoring the inputs and outputs (behavior) of the system but does not immediately have access to internals of the system that generate that behavior. — Markov Blanket.
    * Let us be very clear. A mental concept is a model implemented in dynamical neural structures. Any person’s conceptualization of the world and the things in it is, in fact, a mental model of that world. Computational models are, effectively, extensions of mental model, formalized and encoded in a modeling language (mathematics or something like systems dynamics) but, nevertheless, are just models of the systems of interest in the world. Models built on deeper knowledge of causal processes within the systems are generally better for capturing the predictive or anticipated behavior of the systems and this is what the sciences strive for.
  * 3.2.1.4.2 Inquiry
    * Usually, such explorations can be related to searches for food or other rewards but they are undirected (foraging for example). But in humans, exploration and inquiry seem more opportunistic; that is, there is no direct benefit sought, but just some information that might come in handy some day! Humans have been labeled “informavores!”
  * 3.2.1.4.3 Knowledge Gets Refined and Expanded
  * 3.2.1.4.4 Learning Systems’ Learning Systems (No this is not a typo)
    * No this is not a typo. Here we refer to the idea of systems that can learn actually going through the process of learning other systems (improve their models of other systems; Principle 9 in Chap. 2). This is the basic model of systems epistemology. Systems of suffcient complexity (like our brains) are capable of constructing models of all other systems, including supra-systems, by improving and expanding on a fundamental “system” template. Our effort will be to show how this basic model can be replicated in an artifactual system (the knowledgebase fed by systems analysis).
    * Even the simplest sensor–decider–actor brains (in fat worms for example) are themselves input–process–output devices and that is the fundamental template defnition of a system! By virtue of having a primitive brain, a fat worm possesses a model of self and a primitive model of its world (e.g., mud as a medium/food).
    * This being so, we are now in a position to tackle the problem of developing a universal ontology of system.
  * 3.2.1.4.5 Leveraging Isomorphic Structures and Functions
* 3.2.2 Examples of Developing a System Ontology
  * The desire to construct an ontology that captures the essence of human thinking is not at all new. For example, Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), who we will refer to below, pursued a “Characteristica universalis,” or a universal language of science, that would unify all of the pursuits of the sciences.
  * 3.2.2.1 Miller’s Living Systems Theory image.png
  * 3.2.2.2 Troncale’s System Process Theory
    * Lenard Troncale (Troncale 1978a, b; Friendshuh and Troncale 2012) and co-workers have been working on the concept of systems as processes (systems process theory [SPT] and systems of systems process theory [SoSPT], see below).
    * Troncale also points out a basic problem with ontologies. Ontologies are built with words, and words are notoriously changeable in meaning. (Troncale 1993). The selection of a lexicon that is truly representative of an ontology is not a trivial problem. — SUMO is defined according to logical relationships, not human-interpreted lexical semantics.
    * 3.2.2.3 INCOSE: Systems Science Working Group Effort
      * The International Council for Systems Engineering (INCOSE) has had diffculty describing a discipline of systems engineering owing, in part, to a poor consensus on what systems science actually is and what parts of systems science should inform the engineering of the products systems engineers produce. And this comes from a poor consensus on what a system is!
      * It is a little cart-before-the-horse to have engineers defne a scientifc subject area in this way. However, given that the need is extremely great (systems engineering is going to happen regardless of the state of a system ontology!) it is not entirely unprecedented. And, as it happens, many high-level systems thinkers have been involved in the effort so there is a high degree of expectation that the work will produce useful insights. As of this writing, the authors’ own efforts are being invited to be incorporated in the effort. So, this chapter and the next will become part of the process within INCOSE to build a universal ontology (and language) of systems.
  * 3.2.2.4 Natural Semantic Meta-Language
  * 3.2.2.5 System Dynamics (SD)
    * DYNAMO, his early language, used a lexicon based on the idea that all systems involve fows of matter, energy, and messages, or, more generically, just fows of stuff and infuence. It also involves the states of reservoirs or “stocks” of stuff that rise and fall relative to the fow rates of inputs versus outputs. He defned regulators or “valves” that controlled the rate of fows as well as sensors and control decisions that would change the settings on the valves.

  * 3.3.1 The Ontogenic Cycle 
  * The ontogenic cycle is the process whereby “things” that exist at a level of organization interact with one another. Some things interact strongly, for example forming strong bonds or mutual dependencies that will hold them together in space over time.
  * 3.3.1.1 The Basic Process image.png
  * Figure 3.7 image.png
  * Figure 3.8 image.png
  * Figure 3.9 image.png
  * In the following section, we sketch the elaboration of structures, forms, and functions in a hierarchy of complexity as ontogenesis produced the Universe we witness today.
* 3.3.1.2 Levels of Organization
  * Figures 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 show some relations between “things” that show progressively greater complexity as new levels of organization (to which they belong) emerge. We will discuss the progressive origins of these things below as well as the levels of organization and emergences. Figure 3.10 presents the purely physical (i.e., subatomic and atomic) entities that end up producing both large-scale entities like galaxies and small-scale entities like gases and rocky bodies through chemical interactions.

  * So, with the origin and development of life, we go into the realm of the complex adaptive and evolvable systems (CAES) mentioned in the Introduction, again in Chap. 2, and to be refned in Chap. 6.
  * The Ecos is an alternative and broader name for the whole Earth system (which includes Luna and Sol having major input infuences on what happens on the surface of the Earth) not in opposition to the popular term, Gaia (Lovelock and Margulis 1974), but as a way to situate Gaia as the physiology of a larger phenomenon (c.f. Volk 1998).

* 3.3.1.4 Auto-Organization: Creating Structure.
* 3.3.1.5 Emergence: New Structures and New Interactions
* 3.3.1.6 Selection
  * We view selection as an all-encompassing process in which the context or environmental conditions operate on emergent forms to destroy those that are susceptible (i.e., denature proteins that are not stable) and leave in place those that are thermodynamically or physiologically, or sociologically, stable. The survivors are free to interact and start the next phase of ontogenesis; to produce the next level of organization. 
  * The result of selection is the basis for the next round of ontogenesis. That which proves effective, and survives within the context of the environment created by the level of organization, participates in the next round of auto-organization. The ontogenesis of new levels of organization thus emerges and the Universe experiences new levels of complexity. Hence, Figs. 3.6 and 3.7 and the framework they invoke.
* 3.3.2 Other Takes on Ontogenesis
  * This view of increasing complexity is neither new nor unique to our conceptualization. In fact, many authors have examined this apparent trajectory of the evolving Universe. In this section we examine a number of previous or current concepts of how the Universe is evolving toward increasing complexity and, especially, as represented by the evolution of life and humanity on the planet Earth.

  * 3.3.2.2 Combogenesis
  * 3.3.2.3 Emergence by Continuous Integration and Diversifcation
* 3.4 An Ontological Framework
  * In this section, we will provide an ontological framework that asserts that what can exist in this evolving Universe, made of matter and energy, organized by knowledge and information, is systems. Put differently, matter and energy interact according to the infuences of knowledge and information to produce systems at all scales of space and time, at all levels of emergent organization, and complexity.
* 3.4.1 The Framework, Its Purpose, and Its Justifcations
  * Figure 3.13 image.png
  * The framework for the system ontology is shown in Fig. 3.13. This may be called a conceptual model in that it demonstrates not only the ontological commitments but also how they are organized. The figure is a graph representation of elements (nodes) and their relations (edges) along with category names and organizing labels (levels).
  * Elements (nodes in the directed graph) in all capital letters denote terms that will be used in the top-level ontology of systems. These are the things that exist by virtue of the Universe organizing as it does, through auto-organization, emergence, and evolution (Mobus and Kalton 2015, Chaps. 10 and 11), which we are now calling the ontogenic cycle in Sect. 3.3.1. These are the core things that we will look for in our analysis of systems regardless of the level of organization or complexity. As we will show in the next chapter, for example, the element labeled COMPONENT at Level + 1 may be readily seen as a subsystem of the system at Level 0. That component/subsystem would then be subject to the same analysis imposed by the framework in the figure. It will become the system of interest and be its own Level 0. The analysis simply reapplies the conceptual framework with the previous SYSTEM becoming the new ENVIRONMENT
  * The framework is composed of three aspects. The frst aspect, the nodes in the graph, is the set of ontological elements themselves. The second, signifed by the words on the left side of the graph, is the ROLES that the items in that region (horizontal level) of the graph play. The third aspect shows the higher–lower relation that frames the system hierarchy; the level numbers are relative positions in the hierarchy
  * Starting at the top, the ENVIRONMENT encases and defnes both the CONTEXT and the MEANING of the system of interest (SOI). This is designated as Level − 1, or one level up.67 It is also often referred to as the supra-system. Level 0 is that of the SOI, the system that we seek to understand and model. Level + 1 is one level down from the SOI meaning the level of organization in which we find the internal components and their interactions—that which gives rise to the SOI behavior and defines its boundary.
  * In the next section we will elaborate on all of the elements, relations, and categorizations illustrated in Fig. 3.13
* 3.4.2 The Aspects 
* 3.4.2.1 The Ontological Elements of the Framework
  * In the section below, “The System Ontology”, we will defne and describe these elements and their expansion into sub-elements that exist. Here we provide a brief explanation of the major elements in the framework in preparation for that expansion
* 3.4.2.1.1 ENVIRONMENT
  * In this structure the top or highest element is the environment. This is the suprasystem that encloses the system of interest (see Fig. 3.4). Environments are, by defnition, more complex than the SOI. This is because that larger system contains the SOI, which is then a subsystem, as well as other systems interacting with the original SOI. Hence, the complexity of the environment includes the complexity of the various subsystems.
* 3.4.2.1.1.1 CONTEXT
  * This refers to the set of conditions that obtain at a time instant relevant to the dynamics of the SOI. The environment in an evolving Universe is continually changing in so many various complex ways, so contexts also change.68 The fundamental context is that of the various other systems with which the SOI interacts in an on-going way. These are the sources of inputs and the sinks for outputs across the system boundary.69 Other sources, not necessarily recognized as an identifable nature, may affect a system through what we will call a “disturbance.”
* 3.4.2.1.1.2 MEANING
  * In our system ontology, we consider MEANING to describe a set of conditions that have a trinary affective influence on a system.
* 3.4.2.1.2 SYSTEM
  * This ontological element is quite obviously the core of the whole enterprise. There are three ways to view a system of interest: as a process, as an object, and as an entity.
* 3.4.2.1.2.1 PROCESS
  * All systems within the Universe are open to input and output fows of at least one of: material, energy, or messages (which are special forms of material/energy fows). Systems process or transform the inputs into outputs. The collective effect of the process is also called the “function” of the system. The processes inherent in the bits and pieces of a rock, strong chemical bonding, produce its qualities of hardness and stability over time (soft sandstone notwithstanding). The processes of digestion in your alimentary track function to acquire nutrients for your body’s maintenance.
* 3.4.2.1.2.2 TYPE
  * We are using the term “type” here in a very general way. It can refer to a category, which is usually found in a hierarchical structure, or it can refer to what we are calling an “archetype” (see Chap. 10 for an elaboration on the concept of archetypes).
* 3.4.2.1.2.3 ENTITY
  * An entity is a concrete system that does something actual, having causal effect on other entities or objects in its environment. Concrete systems are real and identifable as unique, at least within a minimal category. That is, a system as an entity is an actual thing in itself and not something like a category (though it belongs to a type).
* 3.4.2.1.2.4 BEHAVIOR 
  * All systems display activity on some time scale. They interact with other systems by virtue of properties of their boundaries and their components (below).
* 3.4.2.1.2.5 BOUNDEDNESS
  * All systems are delineated from their environments by virtue of coherence of the components. We can talk about this as providing an “effective” boundary. In some systems this will manifest as a physical barrier demarking the insides of the system from its environment, such as the case of cell membrane.
  * The Boundary “Problem”
  * Figure 3.14 image.png
* 3.4.2.1.2.6 COMPONENT
  * All systems contain components that internally operate (behave) to produce the process that the system entails. Components may themselves be systems, or atomic, i.e., irreducible.
* 3.4.2.1.2.7 INTERACTION
  * All systems interact with other systems to some extent or another. There are no isolated systems. Interactions result from properties of their boundaries and processes.
* 3.4.2.2 Roles 
  * All of these elements play various roles within the framework. 
  * 3.4.2.2.1 Teleonomy —  
  * Referring to the interactions between the environment and the SOI (Level − 1 to Level 0 in Fig. 3.3): The term “teleonomy” is used to designate something like a “purpose.” Purpose is a highly problematic concept, both philosophically and practically. Do systems have a purpose? Does the environment have a purpose? Does either serve a purpose? Purpose implies intention. Pre-Darwin, the organization of the world was easily explained by the intentions of God. Post-Darwin the situation has gotten more complicated. Systems exist and persist in their environments as a result of performing some kind of function that is benefcial, ultimately to the supra-system.
  * Nature bats last, and always wins.
  * Living and supra-living systems (e.g., organizations) are certainly purposeful in doing what they have to in order to stay alive (operate) and procreate (proft/grow). They are adaptive and evolvable systems that can reconfgure their internals to meet new challenges.
* 3.4.2.2.2 Qualities
  * This refers to the set of aspects that confer systemness on a “thing.”
* 3.4.2.2.3 Attributes
  * We attribute systemness to an entity (or process) based on the fact that what is perceived by another system (we humans for example) is the behavior of a bounded object. When we cannot know directly what is going on inside the object, we can still infer something is happening inside by virtue of sensing what is going in from the outside and what is coming out from within, or, in other words, crossing the boundary, and this includes the responses to forces as well as the production of forces applied to entities in the environment.
* 3.4.2.2.4 Composition
  * The boundary of the system keeps the contents in and the rest of the environment not needed as resources out. A system is composed of components that have interactions with one another. They are linked by various ways, forces, and fows of substances.
* 3.4.2.3 Levels
  * The concept of levels in a hierarchy is quite natural.
* Figure 3.15 image.png
* 3.4.3 Using the Framework — This describes how to use the framework
* 3.4.3.1 Applying the Principles at Level − 1 in the Framework
  * We are now in a position to attempt an organization of ontological elements using the framework and examining various proposed elements from the numerous methods discussed above and examined elsewhere. Our starting point is to use Level − 1, the ENVIRONMENT, and Level 0, the existence of a SYSTEM, with the role of CONTEXT and MEANING, focusing our attention on the Purpose of the system.
* 3.4.3.2 Applying the Principles at Level 0 in the Framework
* 3.4.3.3 Applying the Principles at Level 1 in the Framework
* 3.4.4 Upper Ontology
  * What we have accomplished at this point is the construction of an “upper” ontology or the base concepts that are used to derive all other concepts of that which exists in the real world. The framework we employed has provided us with a basic vocabulary of highest-order categories of those things that exist. The work ahead, then, is to construct the “lower” ontology for systemness, e.g., identifying specific categories of things that have specific kinds of causal effect in the world.

  * Thus, we will now develop the ontology of systems and derive a terminology that is applicable to any kind of system at any level of complexity. This ontology will be the basis for the development of the lexicon of a system language (SL), to be developed in the next chapter
* 3.5.1 Background Categories
  * 3.5.1.1 Space
  * 3.5.1.2 Time
  * 3.5.1.3 Space-Time.
* 3.5.2 Framework Elements 
* 3.5.2.1 ENVIRONMENT
  * Every SOI is embedded in a larger system, the supra-system. Generally, the SOI will interact directly with only a few other subsystems of the same level of organization status and/or atomic components (see below). The environment contains all of the sources of inputs (matter, energy, and messages) and the sinks for outputs (same substances). It also contains all of the channels (or felds) through which fows occur. The entities of the environment connect directly with the boundary of the SOI.

* 3.5.2.2.2 OBJECT
  * Every real system has physical extent in an appropriate frame of reference. It takes up space and has duration. No two objects may occupy the same space at the same time.
  * There is, however, a situation in which some systems can “seem” to occupy the same space. This occurs when the boundary of an object is fuzzy, that is, the boundary may soften or morph for some period of time. One of the best, and most dramatic, examples of this is when a single person (or a group of individuals) moves from one system in which they participate to another
* 3.5.2.2.3 ENTITY
* 3.5.2.2.3.1 Actor
* 3.5.2.2.3.2 Agent
  * A special pattern of an information processing subsystem is a decision maker. The decision maker takes in information from the environment, processes this information in the context of a decision model, and generates a “decision.” The latter is output that is coupled with an effector subsystem to cause behavior to occur. The nature of agents and agency will be covered in Chap. 12.

* 3.6 Putting It All Together 
* 3.6.1 Terminology
  * The point of an ontological study is to determine the existence of objects, their relations with one another, their effects on one another, and their overall structure in time and space. The second point is to assign terms (symbolic names) to these objects, relations, and actions, and to determine legitimate connections between the terms, in other words, the syntax of a language. That will be the task tackled in the next chapter where we elaborate an initial lexicon and syntax of the system language. 
  * This work requires establishing a hierarchy of abstractions, such as the idea that there is a universal concept of a movement or “fow” of something (material, energy, or message) that sits atop a Space-Time coordinate structure (a Newtonian version) or a set of distinctive kinds of channels (a relativistic version). A fow of material is distinguished from a fow of energy
* 3.6.1.1 The Natural Language Version of Terms
  * Thus, the terms in our ontology of system will attempt to be English words that represent the most abstract conceptualization of the system term relating to the systemese concept.
* 3.6.1.2 A Basic Example of the English Ontology of Systems
  * Finally, we list here a set of terms along with their hierarchical relations derived from using the framework described in Sect. 3.4. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but it includes some of what we believe to be the most useful concepts in understanding concrete complex systems.
  * ....
  * These basic concepts of what exists will be expanded throughout the book, but will be given more defnitive status in the next chapter.
