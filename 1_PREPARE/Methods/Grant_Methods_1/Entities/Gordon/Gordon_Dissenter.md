hello everybody Welcome to a new episode of the dece center I'm your host as always Ricardo lops and today I'm joined
by Dr Deborah Gordon she is a professor in the department of biology at Stanford
University she studies how ant colonies work without central control using
networks of simple interactions and how these networks evolve in relation to
changing environments and today we're going to talk a little bit about that so
Dr Gordon welcome to the show it's a big pleasure to everyone thank you it's great to be here
Decision-making from an ecological perspective
so before we get into and specifically and I know that there are thousands of
ant species out there so we'll probably just focus on a few of them so but first
of all uh sort of a general question so how do you approach the study of
decision making from an ecological perspective
well I think about Collective Behavior so an ant colony Works without anyone in
charge there's a queen but she just lays the eggs she doesn't tell anybody what to do
and it works through simple interactions among the ants mostly chemical mostly by
smell and what I try to understand is how those interactions add up to the
functions of the colony in relation to the changing surroundings that the colony is working with
Distributed problem solving
and in Social insects or at least some of the social insects there's something
that's called distributed problem solving so what is that and how does it
work I mean why is it distributed well distributed processes are very
common in nature not just in ant colonies so a distributed process is a
process that operates through local interactions among the participants without any overall assessment of what
needs to be done or any Global control and we use distributed processes in
computer programs we see distributed processes throughout nature for example
you could say that the cells in a tissue work through distributed processes because nobody tells the liver to do its
job instead the cells in the liver through local interactions accomplish tasks
so there are all kinds of distributed processes at work all around us
and in the particular case of and what role does genetic play in their behavior
The role of genetics and the environment in ant behavior
and particularly in their sociality I mean is it that to some extent their
behaviors are genetically encoded or not so much
I think that they're trying to divide up
[Music] beings as apart genetic and part
environmental because the genetic process requires interaction with the
environment to work and of course uh part of the way that we respond to our
environment is through those genetic processes so I resist all attempts to
separate the genetic and the environmental into um particular bins
so I don't think that we can really answer that question and for example related to that there
are contexts where there's what you call context dependent expression of jinns
correct yes that's true for all genes everywhere in every organism so
um genes are part of the template for creating proteins but not all genes are
working all the time and instead there are a lot many layers of processes that
trigger the expression of genes that is that that lead to certain proteins being
expressed at a certain time so genes don't just chug away all the time they turn on and off and when they
turn on and off depends on what's happening around them and for example when ants use chemical
signals that's something you refer to earlier does it have any effect on Jin's
does it modify for example their gin expression in any way
well we know that gene expression changes in ants with time of day so
according to daily rhythms and we know that gene expression changes when an ant
changes task so ants like honeybees
um as the individual worker grows older it changes from one task to another and
we know that its gene expression changes when it makes those transitions but there's a loop that we find very
difficult to get out of we don't know how much the changing situation leads to
changes in gene expression and how much changes in gene expression are related
to the worker changing its Behavior so we don't really know which is the
cause of which right and talking about tasks where does
Task allocation in ant colonies
the vision of Labor stem from I mean how is it that ends acquire a particular
role in their society again I think division of labor is
really not the right phrase for what ants are doing and so I prefer to think about task allocation which is this
distributed process where the colony adjusts which ants are doing which task and also
whether they're actively doing it right now so division of labor comes from and ideas about dividing up work in a
factory where one person puts the handle on the door of the car and the other one puts the hinges on the door of the car
and the other one you know works on the steering wheel and so on and everybody has a fixed job and they do that over
and over forever while in natural systems and for example
in an ant colony the ants are all maybe doing some task
today right now but if the knees of the colony change
ants could be pulled from one task to another task they can switch tasks and
so what's really interesting is to think about how the colony can organize that
without anybody in charge without any central control so how very simple rules
could get more ads to a certain task when they're needed
and so what are some of the factors that play a role in our ants are distributed
throughout the different tasks in particular colonies
well one species that I've studied a lot is the Harvester ant in the desert in
the southwest U.S and I did some experiments where I created a need for
more ants in some task and I had the ads of different tasks
marked by putting a little spot of colored paint on their heads yeah and so
I for example I put out extra food then the ants that were doing a different
task would switch to become foragers and go out and collect the food and if I created a disturbance ants from
inside the nest would become patrollers which are the ones that respond to disturbance
and I saw that there was this flow of ants from one task to another so when
more ants were needed they would be pulled out of one task and into another but at least in this species it's a
one-way flow so the ants um the younger ants inside the nest
who are working on taking care of The Brood and storing the seeds and
maintaining the structure of the nest and taking out the garbage those ants
will move out to become foragers outside the nest but once they become a forager they
won't go back so we see similar kinds of things in cells in a in a mammal so there are stem
cells that can become other functions but some functions are irreversible and some functions can go on to change again
so we see this same process of task allocation for example when an embryo
develops and certain cells become take on certain functions and some of them
are irreversible they they stay there and some of them can they can change further so it's the same kind of process
in an ant colony where individuals in a certain task can
move to another we know a lot about that in honeybees because honeybees are a domestic animal
that have been bred by people for 10 000 years to do certain tasks outside the
nest so we want them to go out and pollinate the plants for our crops and
so they have been selected for to move very quickly from working inside the
nest to going outside to do the jobs we want them to do so we have um actually been able to use
selection to make them likely to switch to foraging very readily and very soon
because that's what we want them to do and ants no one has ever um you know used as for agriculture or
anything and so they do their own agriculture but not for us and uh we
have a huge Variety in the 15 000 species of ants in how they manage task
allocation and how what it is that triggers ants to change tasks
but I mean for example what is the role that age plays there when it comes to
task allocation does it play a role or not yes as ants or bees get older they're
more likely to move outside the nest and work outside the nest so um in ants
um the ants like all the insects are first an egg and then a larva it looks
like a little tiny caterpillar and then a pupa which looks something like a cocoon and then it comes out as a worker
as an adult and it doesn't grow anymore after that and so the ants that have just come out
of being pupae that's called a closing the ants that have just a closed are right there near the other brood
because they were brewed until recently themselves and the youngest ants tend to
stay around The Brood where they just emerged and take care of the brood and
as they get older they're more likely to be uh bumped out further away from The
Brood and towards the outside so it seems generally that younger ants
are inside and older ants are outside and do and recognize Nest mates and if
Do ants recognize nestmates?
so how do they do it that works again we think through a
distributed process so ants are coated with a layer of grease a kind of waxy grease that keeps
them from drying out they're called cuticular hydrocarbons and they use
those to recognize each other both within and
across colonies so ants of a given Colony don't have all exactly the same
hydrocarbons but uh they are more alike than the ants of a neighboring colony
and we think that it works by analogy with the immune system that an ant
starts out with with a boundary between what it recognizes as its own colony and
what it recognizes as a different colony and this is work that I did with
Fernando esponda who is a computer scientist um and we imagine that the the ants
boundary for what it recognizes as Nest mate and what it recognizes as not an
estimate but another colony shifts over time so when it's young it
accepts everybody it needs and that's works well because it's inside the nest
and everybody it meets is an estimate and as it gets older and it starts to work outside the nest it's more likely
to meet workers from another colony and to shift its boundary and say okay
you don't smell right I think you're uh not an Esme Maybe
it has some bad experience with an ant from another Nest who recognizes it as a
stranger and acts in a hostile way so that the ants over time are all
shifting their decisions about who's an estimated who isn't and we see in
experiments that the ants that have been outside the nest more are more likely to recognize ants of another Colony as
strangers and I say that's an analogy with the immune system because our immune system
works the same way that we have cells that accept everybody they meet as part
of our own body until they meet a pathogen and then the cell the immune cells change to recognize that pathogen
so that we have acquired immune response through our interactions over time
so it's a distributed system in the sense that at any moment who recognizes
the others as a stranger um depends on the interactions that
they've had and there's no central control that says okay now everybody in
this Colony thinks everybody in that colony is a stranger but the ends that are part of a
Do ants move between colonies?
particular Colony I mean our colonies fixed in terms of the ants that are part
of them or can there be movements of ants from one colony to the other and if
so how does that happen no ants within a colony
um don't move to another Colony okay honeybees do that but ants don't do that the ants that we know about so again I
should say there's maybe um more than 15 000 species of ants and
maybe 50 of them have been studied in detail so although we say this is true
of ants and we generalize really there are so many species of ants that we
don't know anything about but as far as we know um ants will accept ants of another
Colony only when they're brewed when they are larvae so you can take larvae
of one colony and put them in another and they will um
grow up in that colony and be recognized and the Ants um secrete these
hydrocarbons themselves but they also spread them on each other by grooming so
it seems that if you if larvae of one Colony end up in another they will be
um uh covered with the odor of their New Colony and they will be accepted and
there's no problem but once they are workers they can't go into another colony because they smell wrong
mm-hmm but does it have something to do with
genetic relatedness or not
um well we um you know I think originally everybody thought that but we have results
you know that don't really um conform to that because we find that
even within a colony the cuticular hydrocarbon profile changes over time
so I think originally people imagined that each ant was born with a sort of a passport it says this is my colony and
it just remains fixed but that doesn't seem to work that way so we don't really know
um how different the neighboring colonies or the the the different colonies have
to be for the ants to say um I don't I don't accept you as part of
my colony you know I also asked you that question because sometimes people use the example
Genetic relatedness, kin selection, and group selection
of some use social insects like some species of ants to uh they give them as
examples of for example mechanisms like in selection or group selection and
sometimes they talk about the fact that they are genetically related to then
invoke in this case skin selection but I'm not sure if that's something that is
well accepted or not yes well the idea of can selection came
from the example of the social insects and it
was Bill Hamilton's idea um really in the early 60s William D Hamilton and
um he noticed that there's something very peculiar about the genetic system of the hymenoptera that's the ants the
bees and the wasps and that is that the females have two
chromosomes and the males have only one and that means that um uh an
unfertilized egg um uh will grow up to be a male
so all the females are diploid so when you work out the numbers it
turns out that if a queen mates only once and she has workers as Offspring
they will be more related to each other than they would be to their own daughters because they share the genes
of their mother if they have if there's only one father um so we could talk more about that but
it does work out that way and so um Hamilton's idea was if
how is it possible that the workers who don't reproduce how could not reproducing evolve maybe I
should step back and say that the way that an ant colony works is that there is one reproductive female the queen or
there may be more but they they lay all the eggs they mate and they lay the eggs
and they produce these sterile female daughters who we call the workers and
Hamilton's question was how could not reproducing ever evolve so if you were
to imagine there's a gene for not reproducing then how would it ever get spread right and
um the answer was that his answer was that if the queen mates only once the
workers are actually more related to their sisters than they would be to their own daughters so if this Gene sort
of appeared out of nowhere then it could spread by the system so it's a beautiful
idea but it turns out that in um all the ants that we've studied and also in
honeybees that the queen mates many times so the arithmetic doesn't work out
it's not really true that the that the workers are more related to each other
than they would be to their own daughters because there are many different fathers in a colony
so um that was though the origin of the idea about kin selection that maybe when
we try to understand how um certain traits are spread through
future Generations that we could imagine that there would be behavior that would
promote the um offspring of relatives Over The Offspring of
um non-relatives of individuals who are not related uh but actually
um I don't think that we need to worry about that in an ant colony because we can think of the whole Colony as the
reproductive individual so the queen um makes new reproductives that go out
and mate with those of other colonies and they start new colonies she can't do
that without the help of the workers so really the queen and the workers are all working together to make more offspring
colonies so if we just zoom out a layer and imagine the queen The Colony as the
reproducing um individual then we don't really need to worry about this question
um it's like a tree um uh creates uh flowers that get pollinated and it makes seeds and it
makes new trees so you don't need to ask you know why does the trunk of the tree help the leaves
because the the trunk of the tree and the leaves are working together to make more trees and in the same way the
workers and the queen of an ant colony are working together to make more colonies
so it's not really group selection either group selection acts on a group of
independently reproducing individuals so group selection in an ant colony in ant
colonies would be groups of colonies because really the colonies are the reproducing individuals does that make
sense yes it makes sense it's just that I I mean I asked you that question also
Levels of selection in evolutionary biology
because of course there's these big debate in evolutionary biology of uh
level regarding levels of selection and sometimes people get the debits get very
hit the selection occurs on an individual level on the group level I
mean in the role that can selection might play or not in particular animal species and so on so and many times
people bring they use social insects to the table in those debates right well
then they're talking about the about the reproductive success of the
ants I don't think that makes a lot of sense because ants do not reproduce by themselves they reproduce as part of
colonies so I think um Imagining the answers as independent individuals and
asking why should they work together when they could just be you know each of them by themselves doesn't make any more
sense than asking you know why does your finger agree to participate to be part of your hand well it just is part of
your hand and your finger wouldn't work if it wasn't attached to your hand just as an aunt wouldn't be able to function
if it weren't part of a colony so we see that colonies we produce and make more
colonies and so I don't think that we need to worry about the hypothetical situation where each
ant would somehow prefer to be on its own um making its own
profits you know right so another question I'll do ants
Do ants have personalities?
have personalities and what does personality really mean in the context
of evolutionary biology and in the particular case of ends
what personality is a is a recent name for something that we've been talking
about in evolutionary biology for a long time as variation among individuals so
we know that we have variation among individuals in size and shape and so on
and personality is a way of talking about variation among individuals and behavior but of course we know that
individuals vary in Behavior so um I think a person the work on
personality has focused on a certain kind of variation among individuals and
behavior which would be um usually something along a gradient of
um what's called bold or shy or more pushy or aggressive or something like
that um but that's one of the many ways that individuals do vary in behavior and we
see that in every kind of um I mean we see that in every animal we
see even in Plants you know the Trees of a given species are not alike but we
don't call that personality we call that variation anyway um I don't know about variation among
ants in personality but certainly we see variation among colonies in Behavior
and that variation um seems to be in how they use interactions
to regulate their behavior so um to step back we know that ants use
the rate of interactions to decide what to do so in Harvesters for example the
interactions are antennal contacts when one ant touches the antennae of touches
another with its antennae it they smell with their antennese so when one ant touches another with its antennae it's
smelling the other ant and what they're smelling are these cuticular hydrocarbons on the other ant's body and
the Ant is using the rate at which it smells or contacts other ants to decide
what to do so we know about this from experiments where we can coat little glass beads
with these hydrocarbons and introduce them at a certain rate and the Ants respond as if they were meeting other
ants so the differences among colonies and how they react to disturbance what
you could call personality or variation among colonies those differences seem to be
slight differences in how individual ants react to interactions so for
example the ones that are more likely to respond to interactions it takes fewer
interactions to get them to do something will seem to have behavior that is just
more likely to be active in certain ways relative to colonies that are maybe a
little more hesitant or um some interesting work um that uh Noah
pinterwaldman did when she was in my lab shows that colonies
um react differently according to the nest that they're in so she looked at a
species of ant that where the colonies move around there's some nests out there and you have these ants in Portugal for
example uh uh Messer harvester ants and they um The Colony will live in a nest for a
while and then it will move and then another Colony will move back into the nest where it was and so these colonies
are shifting around in different nests and what um we found was that the
behavior of the colony is very much determined by the nest so we think that the nest that has
chambers that are shaped in such a way that the ants are more likely to meet each other will react more quickly
because the ants come up against each other something happens outside instead
of having maybe big Chambers where they're more spread out and they don't meet each other as often they're more
likely to meet and they're more likely to act and so it looks like the colonies have a different personality or
differences in Behavior which in that case is dictated by the way that the nest funnels them together and leads
them to interact so we see a lot of differences among colonies in how they behave
and we see that those differences have different sources
and we um just accept that selection is acting
on this variation among colonies so can we talk about
Are there hierarchies or caste systems in ant colonies?
hierarchy in ant colonies is there really a hierarchy or not
um in species of ants um we see that uh
there's some um fighting among individuals and among
that has and the outcome is um who reproduces so if we say that
reproducing is highest than we could say there's a hierarchy in
that the it ends up that some of them become queens and some of them don't
I think that that's um taking a story from human behavior and imposing it on
them I mean it's giving more power to the ones that we produce than the ones
that don't but it's not really clear to me that the ants experience that as
power um so hierarchy implies some kind of
power um again to go back to the example of a finger you know you could say that your
heart has more power than your finger because you need your heart to survive and you could lose your finger and still
survive but I'm not sure that you would really say that's a hierarchy it's more a distribution of function or
something like that but and what about the caste system is there's also some
sort of anthropomorphism that people are applying here when they talk about potentially
caste systems existing in and colonies or not
well absolutely the the idea of caste comes from Human societies where
different people are assigned a a social status that is thought to attach to them
permanently in um and colonies most species that we
know about um once an ant is a worker it does not become reproductive
and once an ant is a reproductive it does not become a worker that's not completely fixed but um it's it's fairly
fixed um so the word cast was originally
applied to that or I think people sometimes get confused between the idea of caste as distinguishing workers the
ones who re who don't reproduce and reproductives the Queens who do reproduce that's one notion of cast but
it gets kind of Blended in with this other notion that's sometimes called behavioral cast which treats the ants
that are collecting food as a different cast from the ants that are cleaning up
the nest and that really um they're the analogy to
um some kind of fixed human system really does not hold because the ants
can change whereas cast is meant to imply that it's permanent and can't be changed
so I don't think that it it's a very good way to talk about the this um
distributed process of task allocation that we know is at work and in that colony because it connotes a fixed
system and that's not what's happening it can studying ant colonies helpers
Can ants help us understand other systems that work without central control?
understand better how other systems that work without a central control work or
not well the great thing about and colonies and looking at their Collective
behavior is that they are so diverse not just in numbers of species but in
ecology so there are ants living in every conceivable habitat and they're
using every conceivable resource they nest in the ground they nest in the trees some of them grow their own fungus
to eat they eat seeds or insects or some of them have a bacteria that
process food and and create food for them so there's this huge diversity in how they operate ecologically so I think
they give us examples of how Collective Behavior evolves in different kinds of
ecological situations and maybe there are analogies I think there there are interesting analogies between how
Collective Behavior operates for example in conditions where the resources are
very limited and it takes a lot of energy to to function and in habitats
where activity is very easy and or there's more competition so we
could see how different situations have led to the evolution of different kinds of collective Behavior and I think there
are analogies there with how other systems operate in different ecological conditions that doesn't mean that every
system is exactly like ants but that we can see that Evolution can
um converge to generate Collective Behavior that's similar in similar
ecological situations mm-hmm so we've talked about some terms
Extrapolating from ants to humans
that people try to extrapolate from Human societies to end colonies some
anthropomorphisms perhaps but what about the other way around I mean by studying
ant colonies is there something like for example distributed problem solving
distributed intelligence that we can extrapolate from and societies to human
societies yes but to do that we have to zoom out
so far that we're not taking into account our own identity
and our own narrative about what we're doing and what's happening
um so it's extremely important to us to function as a sane person you have to
know who you are and you have to have some idea about what you're doing right
now if you lose that you're you're not functional but ants operate without that
so there's no evidence that an ant cares you know about that it's ant number 622
and that you're Aunt number 750 it we have no evidence that ants have any sort
of attachment to some personal Identity or that they really need a story about
what they're doing if you watch ants for any amount of time you see a lot of answers kind of bumbling around in an
aimless way and they don't seem to feel that they have to justify what they're
doing so in our relationships with each other we're not like ants because we
have a complicated and really crucial really important network of relations
with other people that's not what ants are doing so in order to see analogies between the way
that ants work and the way that human societies work you have to think about very large human networks where
individual identity doesn't matter like the internet the internet operates in a
certain way through these particular interactions that we have set up between computers and routers and servers and
people and it doesn't really matter who you are when you type an email message you're
using this network that works in a certain way and it doesn't really care about the identity of the of the
participants the identity of the participants doesn't matter and so I think that we do have a lot of
um large networks that operate through distributed processes
um of course some that we have made so engineered networks like that but also ways in which
um again people living in an environment where they're around a lot of people and
they function collectively for example in a city there's all kinds of ways that
we function collectively without any connection to the identity of other
people the way we move on the street the way we operate in the in the subway
system and uh the way that we manage even on a smaller scale of there's some
beautiful work by Irving Goffman a sociologist about how people act in an elevator so the first person goes in and
stands in a certain place when the second person comes in the first person moves when the third person comes in the
second person moves so that's a kind of collective behavior that works through a distributed process where the identity
of the other people doesn't matter you don't need to know the other people in the elevator to operate in this way and
so I think in our lives we have a lot of interactions that are detached from
our personal identity that operate in a distributed way so we participate in a
lot of collective behavior that way great so uh Dr Gordon just before we go
