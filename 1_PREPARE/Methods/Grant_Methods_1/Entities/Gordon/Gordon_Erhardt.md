hello this is Robinson aart here with the introduction to Robinson's podcast
number 212 and as I'm recording this it is very hard to believe that I have
recorded 212 of these introductions because it really does feel every time
as if I'm doing it for the first time still but anyway this episode is with Deborah Gordon who is a professor of
biology here at Stanford University and Deborah is a Mycologist
which though micology sounds like a an
esoteric branch of cryptozoology centered on the study of murol it is in fact a branch of
Entomology centered on ants and Deborah focuses on how complex ant colony
Behavior arises when ant colonies themselves have no central control
because contrary to their time ant colony Queens don't actually do any
ruling and in this episode Deborah and I talk about ants about some of their
distinctive features some neat species and what produces their complex behavior
for more of Deborah's work on Collective Behavior you should check out her book The Ecology of collective behavior and
then if you're more interested in ant societies how they're structured how
they work then her book aptly titled ants at work gives more information on
just these topics there is a patreon for the show a
link to which is in the description that you might consider joining if you're interested
in a link to an adree RSS feed or to
show notes there's also a post up about an AMA that I'm going to be oh I'm going
to be doing monthly amas at least that's my current plan and the first one will
be coming in early July if you'd like to leave a question
also comments likes reviews subscribes those are always greatly appreciated especially on Spotify and apple where I
am battling for that five star rating but now without any further Ado I hope
that you enjoyed this conversation as much as I enjoyed having it [Music]
Ants and Embryology
debah so I am clearly very fascinated by ants so I don't want you to take this
question the wrong way but most people just think of ants as a nuisance and
this makes me wonder immediately how it was that they came to so grip your
interest I started working on ants when I was a graduate student and I was
interested in development m al biology and the debates around reductionism that
went on in developmental biology around the turn of the 20th century um because
there was an explicit debate about whether it was possible to understand
how an embryo develops by thinking about
the um whether an embryo develops through the um playing out of the
internal instructions of each cell or whether instead we need to think about the interactions among cells so it was
an example of a general question about systems without central control in
nature can we understand the causes of what they do by looking just at the
parts or do we have to think about how the parts work together and I was looking for an
example of a system like that without central control like an rrio where it's
possible to see everything as it happens because back then and less so now
because we have better Imaging but even now in order to see how an embryo
develops you have to let it develop and then kill it and look at what's
happening and then let another one develop a little longer and then kill it it's very hard to watch development in
action as it happens inside an embryo but in an ant colony you can see a system without central control and you
can see all the ants and you can see everything that happens so I came to think about ants in this very roundabout
way through this abstract connection to other systems without central
control it's it's interesting that questions of complexity reductionism
emergence this sort of thing is what brought you to ants just because I came to and of course I'm not an expert on
ants but I came to them just from Reading eio Wilson's uh books and I just
thought wow ants are doing these really amazing things yes they
are so I mean before we speak about the some of the emergence um what
amazing things ants do as colonies I thought we might just speak a bit about them as insects so what are some of the
General Features of Ants
general features of ants that distinguish them from other insects social or
otherwise well ants evolved from wasps about 150 130 million years ago
and there are now about 15,000 living
species and they all have in common that they live in colonies consisting of one or more
reproductive females that we call the Queens but in fact all they do is lay the eggs and
then all the ants that you see out walking around are sterile female workers so what characterizes the ants
is that they are very diverse there are many different species and they live in
every conceivable habitat and they're all social in the
sense that they all live in colonies and you said that there are Queens lay all of the eggs but maybe
contrary to the queen metaphor am I right that Queens aren't really ruling
the colonies they're not doing out tasks or anything like that that's right they have no Authority they don't tell
anybody what to do and in fact no ant ever tells another ant what to do so there are no ants that um are directing
the behavior of other ants and you said that the female ants
or the workers are all sterile females what do the male ants do in an ant
colony in most species the males are only alive very briefly to mate and then they
die so for example the harvester ants that I've studied a lot the queen lives
for 20 30 years and she goes on producing all of the ants in the colony
using the sperm that she stored from an original mating session when she was a few weeks
old so she meets males once in her life and then um never
again she produces me m she produces Sons but she doesn't ever M again that's
different from honeybees that um uh have have a different system where the males
are around inside the hive what is the or how related are these sterile female
workers to one another because I know that ants will sort of sacrifice
themselves for one another without um I mean this is anthropomorphizing them but
without any second thoughts or anything like that and my understanding or at least what I remember from reading the
selfish Gene a long time ago is that this sort of behavior can be attributed
or explained to how genetically close they are to one another well that was Bill Hamilton's
Insight um about uh how it is that worker stability
could evolve not so much sacrificing themselves for each other but not
reproducing and his idea was um based on the strange genetic system of all of the
hopter that's the ants the bees and the Wasps where the females are diploid they
have two chromosomes the males are hloy so
every female has one of her mother's two
Al but the same one from the father and that means that in a colony
where there's a queen that mates only once they all have the same
father then the workers are more related to each other than they would be to their
own daughters because they all share this one um hloy uh they all share one
Al from their hloy father so that's how the math works out in fact though now
that we have the genetic tools to track mating and um what's actually happening
it seems very unlikely that there would ever be an ant Queen who made it only
once so in fact the sister are not that closely related to each other and while
it was a a very um cool idea it doesn't actually seem to be happening that way
in the ants so they're not that closely related to each other if they have different
fathers the workers are not that closely related to each other if they have
different fathers what we call the patal lines in the in an an Colony would be a
patol line is all the workers who had in common both a mother and a
father before we move on to some of the more interesting features of ants I you
mentioned that ants sort of evolv from wasps I think maybe or diverg from L 130
to 150 million years ago and I am wondering more about the the differences
or similarities in Behavior between ants and wasps and then some of the other
similar insects like or social or usocial insects like termites and
bees well ants bees and wasps are all part of the same Branch termites are a
completely different order um they're more related to cockroaches than to ants or bees or
wasps so uh termites are different but um the Wasps are have a lot more diverse
ways of living together than the ants so the ants all have the same system with
um some uh females that are reproducing and
a lot that aren't but there's a whole range of systems among the many species
of wasps some of them do that some of them um live together in groups where of
all of the females lays and so on so there's a lot of different wasp versions
of of um social behavior so the ants are actually much more uniform than the
wasps and the same with the bees so there I think about 20,000 species of bees and some of them um have a system
very similar to that of the ants with uh one Queen like the honeybees um the
honeybees of course are a special case because we have been selecting uh for particular kinds of
behavior in honeybees because they been used in agriculture for about 10,000 years so honey bees are a kind of
domesticated version of a social insect but um still there are many species of
bees that live together um and some reproduce and some don't whereas um
there are lots of bees that are not really social at all in that sense and a
bee um a female bee might live by herself lay eggs um they go off and
that's it they don't all it together before again before we get to the
emergence and the complexity of these colonies I think it would be fun both for me and for our listeners to hear
about some of the amazing varieties and and behaviors of ants and before I ask
Some Fascinating Ant Species
maybe about some of the ones that I find most interesting I'm curious if you have
any particular favorite species of ants well of course my favorite species are the ones that I know best like the
harvester ants that I work on in the desert uh or the turtle ants which are um very different or Boral ants that
live in the tropical forest and stay up in the trees and what is unique about these two
species well of the 15,000 species of ants only about 50 have ever been
studied in detail so there are many thousands of species of ants that
somebody has identified as being a unique species but we know nothing at all about them so um we don't really
know how to answer the question of what's unique yeah that's fair but maybe I should ask then rather
rather than what's unique about Harvester and turtle ants what is it about them that you find so fascinating
Beyond of course the fact that you work on them well it's because I work on them
that I know what's fascinating about them but um the one of the most interesting things
as I've gotten to know more about both species is the contrast the differences
in the way that they operate and the ways that Collective Behavior evolves differently in different kinds of
ecological situations so the harvester ants um are living in the desert where
and they eat seeds which change very slowly and so they've evolved a system for
regulating their behavior for um collectively regulating the behavior of
the colony that's really different from the turtle ants which live in the
tropical forest where everything changes really quickly there's a lot of competition and they have to respond
really quickly to um patchy resources that they they find and they have to
take right away so one of the things I've been learning by looking at two
very different species is how differently an colonies
can go about their business and um regulate their behavior maybe I ought to
ask then about some of the ants that I find particularly neat because they're they're more quote unquote flashy ants
so so one species that is cool is um Dracula ants I don't know what those are Dracula
ants are ants that they feed off of the analog of blood of
their of their um they're not pup but they're they're infants they're ants
that are growing well if they ate their their lar
they're yeah they're larv they can't eat all of them or there wouldn't be any left I look up and see what you're
talking about because I just looked up Dracula ants
and we'll see um if I find anything Ado merma
venatrix from Madagascar an endangered species of ants
so it looks like a very primitive ant it doesn't have a
um pedol says that they're blind but most
ants are pretty blind I don't know never heard of them okay interesting
the blood of its young uh so what does that mean I wonder
many species of ants um the Queens lay eggs uh produce eggs that the workers
eat um called trophic eggs but um this on
Wikipedia um I see Phil Ward Brian Fisher worked a lot in
Madagascar um but the Wikipedia article only cites
the um taxonomy but nothing about the eating the the um ly so I don't know
anything about that never heard are are you familiar with Honeypot ants yes I
have even eaten a honey pot ant oh could you I get you know much more about them
than I do what is the the B um the genus is is Merm cistus and they live in the
desert in fact they're uh they live in the same area as the harvester ants that
I work on so I have seen them a lot and um they store food in workers so there
are some workers who stay down in the nest and other ants uh feed them by
regurgitating and they get so fat their abdomen get so big that they can't really move anymore and they just cling
to the the side of the chamber um and they serve as a storage receptacle for
the other ants but they were well known to the indigenous people of the
Southwest desert of the US um because eating it is like eating a little pea sized bowl of Honey um and so
they would dig them up to eat the the repletes as they're called oh I didn't realized that they were actually sweet
yeah and you mentioned a minute ago these trophic eggs that some ant Queens
lay and this is another example of what I think is called Traxis that is no
Traxis is basically when one ant regurgitates into the mouth of another
okay so the the Honeypot ants are not an example of
trophis well uh yes oh that sorry that's what I was saying was an example of trophy axis I
guess I was yeah no but eating trophic eggs an egg is a discrete object that
has come out of the Queen's body and then the other ant eats it but Traxis is the exchange of fluids through the mouth
Parts is trophy axis trophic eggs are
these sort of specific cases of just more General ant Behavior where they
feed one another yeah well in an ant colony the
um food that comes into the colony is distributed around the colony so yes
they always feed each other so trophy loxis is a way of um one ant feeding
another liquids and some ant species eat liquids
and some don't so basically some ants eat um other insects so they basically
eat meat uh some ants eat sweet things like nectar from flowers um or even the
sugary excretions of other insects like scale insects so the ones that some um
insects eat um basically fats like seeds which are sort of like
nuts uh and it's the ones that eat nectar so they're taking in a liquid
that have to spread it around by by Traxis because they've got a liquid in
their body and then they're sharing it by um giving it to another ant whereas
the ants that eat seeds they um share the seeds so they don't do that much
Traxis the L yeah most ant larvey so ant larvey don't have any um developed mouth
parts so they need to be fed so many species where the adults don't feed each
other they still use Proaxis to feed the larve because the larve don't have
another way of of eating um but uh the species that I have worked on most the
harvester ants who eat seeds I've seen them in the lab uh the ants the adults
take a seed and sort of scratch up the surface and then put it next to the mouth parts of the larv so I guess the
ly can actually get something off the seed you mentioned that some ants eat
meat it has been a long time since I read the insect societies which I think
is a 1971 book by EO Wilson and I I've
read in in your work that some of his very important thesis at the time U such
such as um ant sort of being in a certain cast for life have turned out to be false and this might be something
that I read that is not um correct or
maybe I've just manipulated it but I recall reading that ants will often take
their dead out of the colony but termites on the other hand or at least
some species of termites will eat their dead so they're necrophages because they don't get
sufficient protein from the cellulose that they consume and so they need to
recycle the protein within the colony I'm wondering if ants since you said
some eat meat whether you know of any that are necrophages where they'll eat their own dead um I don't um I uh I I've
never heard of ants eating dead ants but there are many known cases of ants
getting rid of the dead ants which might help to prevent disease I don't know much about the the
termite but um uh the protein in the termite has to
come from somewhere so they can't just get their proteins from eating each other
because some somehow there has to be some intake of
protein and just a couple more species of ants that I wanted to ask you about
before we move on are um Malaysian exploding ants are you familiar with
these no what do they do Malaysian exploding ants sort of contain a sort of poison
and they can burst to thwart predators
to thwart Predators or uh other ant colonies that they're Waring
with the Malaysian exploding ANS
okay Malaysia and brune cannect worker can explode suicidally and aggressively
as an ultimate active defense an ability has in common with
several other species okay so I see it has these
glands and it that have some kind of um poison in them and it can contract
so that these glands that are in bags along its body explode
interesting and then the the last that I was going to ask about are leaf cutter ants and then other ants that
might quote unquote Farm other insects well leaf cutter ants a farm of
fungus so there are many different species of leaf cutter ants and uh each
one grows a characteristic kind of fungus which it eats the fungus has to eat too so it cuts leaves they're called
Lea cutter ants because they take pieces of leaf and they feed them to the
fungus and then they eat the fungus so um they're very widespread especially in
South America farming insects uh so many species of ants including the argentin
ants which are familiar to everybody around uh the whole California coastline um they eat the secretions of
scale insects so scale insects like aphids survive what they eat is the
sugary sap in in plants so the aphid um
puts a basically a needle it's prosus into the plant and it extracts the
sugary liquid that's flowing through the plant that nourishes the plant and these insects take in so much
sugar that they actually excrete a lot of sugar and there are many species of
ants that live off of the excretions of the scale insects which are politely
called honeydew that's the the sugary excretion of the of the apens or other kinds of
scale insects and U some species of ants actually uh protect the aphids from
other insects that want to eat the aphids so in that sense they're farming or or tending or shepherding the scale
insects well the the last thing I will ask on this count to flesh out our
survey of some of the interesting features of ants is what are some of the most extreme environments or bizarre
places in which we can find Ants there are ants everywhere every
terrestrial habitat uh except for Antarctica the ants are
everywhere so the range of habitats is the same as the n are in is the same of
the range of habitats that exist they're in high places they're in Low Places
they're in forests they're in deserts they live you know in in jungles they
live in Rocky Barren places they're everywhere yeah okay well how I'll just
ask about one what sorts of ants or how do ants manage to live in some of the
coldest and harshest climates on Earth other than Antarctica by staying um down uh low and
below the snow and huddling together in the winter and only coming out when it's warm enough that's a good way of doing
it yeah so you mentioned that ants all live
in colonies this is something that and they all have Queens that's something that unites them all how vital are
Pheromones and Ant Behavior
pheromones to ant Behavior well most ants can't see so
they operate by smell so there are two classes of odors
that they respond to one is uh the substances that they excrete from their
bodies from different glands in their bodies uh for example something that's familiar to lots of people is the trail
pheromone that many of the invasive ANS that you see in your kitchen use trail
ferons of to recruit opportunistically to resource that show up all of a sudden
like the crusts of your pizza and those ants uh and any ants that use TR
hormones have a gland in their abdomen and um as they walk along they put down
some of it and it's very volatile it evaporates quickly but if another ant comes along before it evaporates then
the other ant will follow it and that's how they make a trail so that's an example of a pheromone and the other
kind of chemical that they respond to is not coming from um is on the surface of their body um
it's basically a waxy uh layer that helps keep the ant from drying out and
many other species of insects have that too and those are called cuticular
hydrocarbons and those are the odors that ants use for example to um decide
whether another ant is a nestmate theong to the same colon or not so those are
much more long lasting than pheromones that tend to be very volatile and evaporate very quickly whereas the cuic
hydrocarbons are very longlasting so they respond to both both to pheromones and to these um odors on the surface of
the other ant's body so both types of pheromones are very interesting but I'm
curious about the cuticular hydrocarbons how is it that and so and
you said that ants will use them to distinguish Nest mates maybe from from
rival colonies and is the now just or the particular cuticular hydrocarbon
that a nest produces to identify itself is that somehow just unique because of
the genetic makeup of the ants themselves or are they kind of I guess
this is anthropomorphizing too much are they sort of like selecting uh a unique
sort of scent to have for their colony it might have something to do actually with what they
eat um so we do know that um feeding ants something
um uh extremely unusual or give them unusual cuticular hydrocarbons so we
don't really know um how they come to be unique but um they change so uh ant an
ants cuticular hydrocarbon profile changes over time so so the the profile
of the colony is sort of drifting along and it's a really interesting question about whether um there's some
way that it changes in relation to the other ANS of other colonies that a particular colony is
encountering and we found for the harvester ants and we don't really have any idea how this would work but we
found that the the hydrocarbon profiles of neighboring colonies were more
different from each other than the profiles of colonies farther away
suggesting that somehow through contact they somehow modify their
hydrocarbon profile and we have no idea how that could work interesting yeah
just because I would assume that if food were a major factor in the cuticular hydrocarbons that the ants produce and
the particular cuticular hydrocarbons are used used by the ants to distinguish
their nestmates from other nearby colonies that it wouldn't be the food just because I would assume that
colonies of similar species in the same environment would be eating the same
things right well maybe depending on what
they're eating and how that's distributed so it may not be the same
for all species of ants um some in some species they don't
really seem to um care very much whether the other ants is an es mate
so species also differ in how strongly they react or how much they seem to respond
to differences in their colonies hydrocarbons and those of the
neighbor and also species seem to differ in how quickly their own ch es but it
seems that the idea that we started with that the hydrocarbon profile was kind of
a passport that was purely genetic and everybody was the same definitely isn't
true so definitely the the way in ad smells and also how it responds to the
array of odors that it meets clearly changes over time and one of the things we've noticed
in Harvester ads we found in Harvester ads is that the ants that are inside the
nest tend to smell more like the ants inside the nest of a neighboring colony
and that as they come out and work outside um the exposure to the sun
changes their hydrocarbon profile so the chemical reactions that are induced by
being outside um and also perhaps by the the
ant's own response to um a a drier
environment um changes its hydrocarbon profile so that an an of a given Colony
can distinguish it's um the ants that are working inside the nest from the
foragers that are working outside the nest because they smell different and we know about this from
experiments where we extract the hydrocarbons off of an ant and we put it in little glass beads and we expose the
ants to these with different smells and we can see that they're reacting to these changes in how an ant smells so an
ant doesn't have the same profile um its whole lifetime and it's not the case that every ant in the colony smells
alike so it's not really just a single passport okay um there's a lot more
going on than that you said that some ants are more
and some less sensitive to these odors and I am wondering whether either the
Harvester or ants are particularly sensitive to the point that they might
be more uh warlike or Bell bellicose than other
ants well the harvester ants definitely detect differences in um
the the they definitely detect a difference between the smell of a nestmate and the smell of a non-
nestmate and um I found that they actually recognized the smell of a
neighbor um they react more strongly to the smell of a neighbor who they've met many times relative to the smell of some
Colony far away that they've never met so they do react but they almost
always react by just turning around and going away not by fighting so they aren't especially
warlike they do fight sometimes but it's pretty rare what do their fights look
like when they do happen uh when the Harvester ANS fight uh one
ant grabs onto the pedo of another and it seems to be trying to to tear it
apart sorry the pedial so an an come like all insects comes in three parts it's got a head an abdomen and a thorax
and the little bridge between the thorax and the abdomen is called the pedal a little segment that links um its its
abdomen to the rest of it and when they fight one ant tries to clamp onto the pedial of another
and it seems to be trying to tear it apart but it usually can't do that and so they end up kind of rolling around
for a long time and often the ant that's
attack attacking dies from exposure because it
been so long out in the sun um trying to tear the other ant apart but its jaw
muscles are so strong that they remain attached even when it's dead and the
rest of it is broken off and you can see after a time of fighting which usually
happens after the summer rains you can see some ants walking around with a head clamped on in between their thorax and
their abdomen because it's their kind of trophy um uh because the the attacker's
head never came off so they only fight in the sorry they
only fight um on really humid days um maybe that's the only time that they can
afford to be outside the nest so long um rolling around trying to tear another
ant apart you mentioned earlier that no ant tells another ant what to do and I
think that this is I mean it's it's interesting for many reasons but when I
Ant Slavery
was reading the insect societies one word uh stuck out at me and that was
dulosis and it was because I have a rud understanding of ancient Greek and I
knew that dlos means slave in ancient Greek so when I just saw DSis I was so
excited that my ancient Greek uh became useful but slavery at least among humans
very explicitly involves one person telling or ordering or forcing another
person to do something and I'm wondering how if no ant tells another ant what to
do ants have something or some species of ants have something akin to slavery I
imagine this is related to odors well it's actually no more of a
mystery than how an ant of the same Colony knows what to do but um to go back to slavery or um whatever we want
to call it there are species of ants that go and steal the the larv and pupy
of other colonies of other species and they bring them back and they wear them
inside the nest and so they work you they join the colony and they do things
in the colony so that's what's sometimes called slave making although it's really
different from slave making in the sense that actually being a slave is taking a person who has a um an identity
someplace and and forcing them to work someplace else um the thing
about uh these these odors is that they don't show up until um an ant is uh an
adult so um people have done this you can take um The Brood from any species
and put it in another species and they will just be accepted and that goes back to your question about where the odors
come from because um the an ant of another species will take on the odors
of the species in which it grew up so they spread it on each other by
glooming uh so um how does the ant then know what to do um well it's
somehow it's it's somehow responding to cues from the um from the other ants in
the same way that an ant of any species responds to the others to decide what to
do so you could say that they have um
uh rules about how to respond to each other that are similar enough that the an of the of the so-called slave species
can function in the other colony but um uh it's not because
anybody told them what to do but an ant of the same species isn't getting told what to do either so it's actually the same question about any species of ant
how do how does an out know what to do yeah and maybe I mean since this is so much of what your work is about maybe we
should uh now shift toward that so quite generally how do individual and
Collective Ant Behavior
interactions lead to this complex Collective behavior of the
colony well in all species of ants it works through local interactions so no
ant is making any Global assessment of what needs to be done you know no an is
thinking no we all need more food or we don't need as much food as we did yesterday or anything like that um
they're just using these simple interactions and um for some ants it's the rate of antennal contact because
when one ant contacts another with its antenna it smells the other ant and it can smell these jic hydrocarbons on the
other ant's body so an ant has some rule like um I'm a forager and I'll go out on
my next trip if I meet enough ants coming in with food so the ant isn't
thinking about how this is going to affect the overall food supply of the colony or how much food there is out
there or anything it's just using its own rate of interaction to decide what to do and in the aggregate that creates the
behavior of the colony or another kind of interaction like that is the trail pheromone um the ant is walking along
and if it um reaches a place where the pheromone left by another ant hasn't
evaporated yet and it's strong enough it goes that way and if it doesn't it might go another way so it's not
thinking let's make a trail from here to there it's just using this local information but in the aggregate The
Colony makes a trail and this is how ants make their Trails up into to my apartment and and
take crumbs that's it that's it so I I I mentioned this earlier I I read in one
of your articles that while you know Wilson thought in the 70s that an ants
cast and the tasks it carries out are static or determined for Life something
like this in fact they aren't and that an ant will play different roles in the
colony as it ages and is one I guess is
it just it will play different roles as it ages and then also is it uh it its
roles shift based on the interactions it has is that am I right with this yeah so
it's been known for a long time that that an ant's task changes as it ages
and um that's very similar to honeybees in fact that's the main thing that we have selected for in honeybees so in a
honeybee um like most ants first Works inside the nest and then it goes out to forage and there's been a lot of
selection on honeybees about that transition because you want the honeybees out um
pollinating the crops so there's been a lot of effort to um shift honeybees
towards less time in the nest and More Time Out foraging and U with ants that's
the same general Trend so the added um idea is that the ants are can shift what
they do in response to interactions with each other which are also reflecting
what's happening outside so for example in harvester ants if there's more food
suddenly then the interactions with foragers can uh lead ants that were
working mostly inside the nest to switch to forage so they're responding not just
it's not just the passage of time it's also the way that the situation is changing and how that affects their
interactions with each other some ants seem to be doing very
well such as the ant in my apartment with the changing environment that has
come from the expansion of human activities but are there many ants that
are negatively affected by human expansion or are they in general just an
exception to the rule that we are not good for the other animal species on Earth no there are many ants that are
being lost as um especially tropical forests are being lost including those first ants you asked me about the
Dracula ants which are um almost extinct um so uh you're right there are many
species of ants that do well with human disturbance and those are the ones we tend to see especially in
cities I don't know where your apartment is is it somewhere around here yeah it's in evgr yeah so those are Argentine ants
and Argentine ants are an invasive species that has spread around the world into Mediterranean climates like the
coast of California Mediterranean Coastline they came from Argentina of on
boats with sugar in the early part of the 20th century and they've probably been
carried all around the world but they do best in developed areas where there are
people and there's a Mediterranean climate so not just California and the Mediterranean but also South Africa
Japan Hawaii um and they do better um in
developed areas partly because we provide water through our plumbing uh in the hot
dry part of the year and also we provide a refuge when it's cold and wet so we
definitely help them individual ants their behaviors change over time how
A Colonyâ€™s Life Cycle
does a colony evolve over time do colonies last indefinitely once they're
established are they just pretty static or constantly growing or how does this
work well we don't know much about that for many species but because that means
um tracking known colonies over time um that's something that I've done with
harvester ants and so I know a lot about that so A Harvester ant colony only
lives as long as its Queen does and I think that's characteristic of many species and a queen can live for 20 to
30 years but it starts out with just one Queen the founding Queen and she uh
makes her nest after the mating FL in the summer and about 6 weeks later there's the first batch of workers and
by the following summer there might be a few hundred workers but by the next year by the time she's two there could be a
thousand and it goes on growing until the colony is five and that's when it
begins to level off and then there're about 10 to 12,000 ants and they only live a year so she has to produce them
over and over every year and so it goes on maybe for another 20 25 years until
eventually the queen dies and when the queen dies there's nobody to make more ants and they don't adopt another queen
so once all the workers have died the colony has died so it seems that most
colonies have um all species have to have a founding stage where a a newly
Nat Queen starts a new colony and then it gets larger and we think that it's
likely that in most species it levels off to some mature size and um then when
the queen dies the colony is dead so there are some species where um
the s a a nest um where the queen has died another
queen can move in and will start the process again so it's not really the
same Colony continuing it's a new colony in the same nest and some of those can
last a very long time like the Redwood ants of Northern Europe um it seems that the same nest can be occupied for
decades or even more um but it's not it's not the same
colony is this bottleneck at age five in the harvester
ants just caused by you know some limit to the amount of young that the queen
can produce in a year we don't know we don't know okay yeah interesting and we also don't know why
the Queen's eventually die um it could be that they they just run out of the
stored sperm and they can't make any more ants um and then there's not enough ants
to keep the whole thing going or they could die of old age we don't
know one of the more complex behaviors in ant colonies as opposed to specific
ants that I know that you have studied is memory and how does
memory manifest itself in an ant colony or I mean in individual ants before we
talk about how this might work what might cause me or explain the memory
well I think it's hard to talk about ant colony memory because we have to decide what you mean
by memory um there are some experiments showing that uh ants trained uh ants of
one species of a campot species trained to go to sugar at one place in a lab
Arena um if you move if you take it away and the Ants are taken out they will go
back to the same place um for about five minutes so maybe those ants can remember
a location for five minutes or the Harvest ants that I work on will go out
to the same place the foragers go to the same place over and over on successive trips so basically they go in a stream
of ants and then they leave the tril at the same place pretty much every time
and search around and then bring the food back so they have to remember where they were on the long enough to get them
back to the nest and back out again um so that's a memory um seems easy to call
that memory then when you're talking about the memory of the colony that's a different thing so if you do something
to a colony one day and uh I've done this you do some kind of peration and
then um a few days later it's still acting it's still acting different as it
did in response to the peration is that do you want to call that memory or could you say that a a process was set in
motion that is persisting over some days it's not so much that the ants remember
something but they're they're still reacting but of course when you get down to it if you want to talk about memory
our memory in a brain you have the same problem you know is there a little package in there that is labeled what I
had for breakfast yesterday or is it that somehow there's some neurophysiological process that makes it
possible to call back um what you ate for breakfast
yesterday so um the closer you get to it the harder it is I think to say what an
Colony memory would be in this second case
where you say you introduce some perturbation to the Colony and then it will respond the same way at a later
time is this sort of behavior also
mediated by something involving scent and and
pheromones um no these would be um for example some
situation where I um create a mess that they have to clean up and they recruit
extra Nest maintenance workers to do it they make the mess for a few days but um
after that they're still doing Nest maintenance work they're still doing extra Nest maintenance work so um you
could say well the colony remembers that there's going to be a lot of mess and so they they keep these Nest maintenance
workers around or you could say that there's some process that got those ants into doing Nest maintenance work and if
they're still there they're easily triggered to do other Nest maintenance work even if the perturbation isn't there
so there isn't any particular ad that's remembering anything but there's a
process in place that acts kind of like memory um I don't think it's it's that
helpful to call it memory because as I say even though we have a pretty clear
idea of what it means for us to remember something that's really something that we do with language right we say
yesterday I had granola for breakfast um and we don't really know how to explain
that either and um so it could be not that um
there's some neuron labeled yesterday's breakfast that's sitting there waiting to be called back on or something but
instead there's some way some pathway analogous to the exter net manance workers being around that that makes it
possible to say that the next day um so I
don't um think we have a enough of a way to explain um any kind of memory to be
very clear about what we would mean by Colony memory in one of the Articles you wrote
you mentioned a Finnish myologist who studies a
European arboreal sort of ant where these ants will like the cold weather
ants that you mentioned earlier they'll spend the winter burrowed with one another deep beneath the snow but then
in the spring pairs of ants will emerge and an older ant will show a younger ant the
trail to I don't know some tree where it used to forage then that ant will die
and the younger ant will sort of maintain this pathway or follow this pathway and I'm wondering how this sort
of uh memory though we don't need to call it memory if you don't want to how
this might function when I would just imagine that after an entire season
whatever sorts of trails this ant might have the older ant might have left would
have been wiped away but maybe they're not wiped away okay well those are redwood ants um uh in the former garua
group and it was Riner rosengren who showed this and those are the ants actually that I was just talking about where the nests persist for um many many
decades even though the colonies within them turn over and they make these big nests of uh mounds of pine needles and
in the winter the whole thing is covered with snow and they huddle together deep underneath where it's a little bit
warmer and then they come out in the spring so that those ants also only living here so it's when they're coming
out that the older ants before they die um go out with a younger Ant and the
younger ant adopts that trail um the Redwood ants are really unusual in that
they can see and so they may be able to see which way it is to a certain tree and they are
tending scale insects in the trees so there's a particular tree that is also
there for many decades and it's got its population of scale insects in it and
they go back and forth to that tree so um it's not clear exactly what the ant
has to remember but maybe it remembers the way something about the angle of the Sun
or something it's probably doesn't see specific trees or anything like what we would see but it might remember some
visual signal that gets it there uh without the trails so um I think that's
fine to call that memory that's memory of the ant by the ant the ant is remembering which way to go so the old
Aunt remembers which way to go the fascinating thing is how does this actually work the pairing up of the
older Ant and the younger ant how do they find each other and
what how how that's stimulated and all of that and um but we do know from
experiments that we did together that it's very difficult to deflect one of those ants from its its Trail so you can
put put out all kinds of wonderful food and they will go they'll deviate from their Trail to get it but the ants will
go right back to the trail that they were on so they're very very um steady
about very persistent on the same Trail so the the colony is remembering
because the colony is is using the same Trails uh after um each cohort of ants
dies but you could say the colony remembers through the Mor of the
individuals so that's actually one of the easiest examples to explain has your research on ants I mean
Revisiting Embryology
now that we're coming towards the end and coming full circle has your research on ants answered any of the questions
about embryology that got you interested in ants in the first
place yes I've learned a lot about how uh itive Behavior works and I think
there are interesting analogies to how it works in other systems so um the
question that occupied the D sh Ru the embryologists of the um late 19th and
early 20th century about whether it's possible for a a system to work without
central control I think um my work but also the work of many others has
definitely answered answer yes to that question and that's true for for embryos also that you don't need to imagine some
kind of central controlling force that regulates the whole thing because we see
that it's possible for systems to work just through local interactions among the participants that in the aggregate
forms the collective behavior that we see and are there any particular
concrete applications that are either extent now or foreseeable in the future
from your work in micology to Human
Society I think that we can see in the diversity of an species and how they
have evolved in relation to different environments we certainly see analogies to how a collective
Behavior can respond to the way that the environment is changing um just some
simple analogies like we see that in situations where um the environment is
very unstable there have to be ways to respond very quickly um whereas when
things are very steady um it's possible to use um ways of organizing Collective
behavior that are more thorough but slower and uh for example there's a um
we all learned a lot about the analogies between um interaction networks and ANS
and in people during the pandemic when we had to modify our own behavior to regulate our rate of interaction with
other people well Deborah thank you so much this has been so fascinating thank you
so much for taking the time to talk to me about ants and your work on them thank you
