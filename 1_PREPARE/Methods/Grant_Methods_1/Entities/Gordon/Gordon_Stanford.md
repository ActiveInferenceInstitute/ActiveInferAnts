Deborah Gordon (Stanford) 2: The Evolution of Collective Behavior
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzPORGfpy_I

Hello. I'm Deborah Gordon. I'm a professor at Stanford, and I'd like to talk to you today
about the ecology and evolution of collective behavior in harvester ants.
I study collective behavior and how systems are regulated without central control.
An ant colony is a great example of a system without central control because there's nobody in charge.
A colony consists of sterile female workers, the ones to see walking around, and although there are one or more reproductive females
and we call them queens, in fact they're not in charge, they don't tell anybody what to do,
they just lay the eggs. I've been studying harvester ants
at this site in southeastern Arizona, now for 28 years.
This species is called Pogonomyrmex barbatus, and they're called harvester ants because they collect seeds
and they eat seeds. This shows the nest of a colony, a mature colony. The ants leave the nest entrance
and they travel on trails that might be cleared or might not be for up to 20 meters,
collect seeds and bring them back to the nest, and they store them inside the nest.
And this behavior, the foraging activity of a colony as well as all of its behavior,
is regulated by local interactions among ants.
This shows ants in a lab arena moving around, interacting with each other.
The arena is connected by tubes to two other arenas.
And this shows the network created by all the ants moving around and interacting,
and when we look at this network and we look to see which ant is interacting with which one,
we can see that some ants interact more than others. They become hubs.
But what we learned from this study is that ants become hubs because they go to the hotspot where there's a lot of interaction.
It's not a characteristic of particular ants, and so in this sense the network of interactions
that these ants are using is a distributed network. It doesn't matter which ant meets which;
ants participate in the network as a function of where they happen to be.
Harvester ants use interaction networks consisting mostly of brief interactions
when one ant touches antennae with another. Most ants operate mostly by smell.
Ants don't see very well, and they smell with their antennae, and when one ant touches another
it can tell if the other belongs to the same colony, and what task its been doing.
And these interaction networks, then, carry no other message.
What the ants are detecting when they smell each other are the cuticular hydrocarbons of the other ants.
Ants, like many insects, are covered with a layer of grease, long-chain fatty acids,
that carry the colony-specific odor. And in this species, at least,
they also indicate what task the other ant has been doing, and that's because the conditions
under which an ant is working change the chemistry of its cuticular hydrocarbons.
When an ant is outside foraging in the hot sun, the chemistry of its cuticular hydrocarbons changes,
and so a forager smells different from an ant working inside the nest.
With my colleague Mike Greene, we've been doing experiments
to learn how ants are using interactions. So, the experiments consist of using
little glass beads or other small objects coated with an extract of cuticular hydrocarbons, and by doing this we can manipulate the interaction rate,
and this is how we learned that there's no message other than the particular kind of cuticular hydrocarbon
and the rate of interaction, because ants will respond to the rate of interaction with a little glass bead
in the same way that they would respond to interactions with other ants. So, harvester ants colonies
have to solve ecological challenges like any other species, and a harvester ant colony's biggest problems are,
first of all, conserving water, because they live in the desert and water is scarce, and then competition with neighbors of the same species.
The seed that they eat are sparsely distributed by wind and flooding, they're just scattered at random,
and so harvester ants don't use pheromone trails. There's no need to recruit, because one ant can bring back a seed by itself,
and the seeds don't occur in patches, so, if you're an ant and you find a seed, that doesn't mean there's gonna be any more seeds nearby.
There's no point going back to get anybody else to recruit to the seeds.
Now, foraging costs water, which comes from seeds. An ant out foraging in the hot sun,
searching for seeds, loses water in the hot desert air, and they get their water
by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat. So basically, a colony
has to spend water to get water. They have to spend water by sending ants out to forage
in order to get water out of the seeds that they collect. So, the colony faces a tradeoff:
too much time spent foraging, they are loosing water, but if they spend too little time foraging
they actually lose foraging area to neighbors because all the neighbors are out searching for seeds
in the same places. So, the colony manages this tradeoff
through a network of interactions among foragers as they come in and out of the nest.
So, the question is, how does a colony regulate its foraging activity? How does an ant decide,
okay, it's time to go out and search? What gets the foragers out? What regulates how many foragers
are out right now? First of all, it's not a simple consequence of how many ants there are,
because the same colony will send out different numbers of ants within a day, from day to day,
and there's a lot of difference from one day to another in how many ants are foraging in all the colonies
depending on how hot and dry it is. So, there is moment to moment regulation of how many ants are going out to forage.
This is how it works: when a forager goes out depends on the rate at which foragers
return with food. So, an outgoing forager doesn't leave the nest
unless it has enough interactions in the form of antennal contact with returning foragers with food.
This makes sense for the colony because it leads to higher foraging effort when more food is available.
The more food is out there, the less time foragers spend searching, foragers return sooner
and they send out more foragers to forage. So, it's a kind of positive feedback.
So, we're trying to understand exactly how this works, and to do that we need to know a little bit more
about what's going on in order to try to measure the rate at which they interact and how that determines the flow of foragers.
So, to learn more about that, I dug up the nest entrances of some colonies to see exactly how they're interacting
inside the nest. This shows the nest entrance of one colony
and you can see, first of all, that there were two nest entrances to begin with,
and then when I dug it up I found two tunnels, and those are indicated with flags,
that lead to an entrance chamber, it's about 5 cm from the surface,
where the nest entrances were leading in. And, in that chamber there was another tunnel leading deeper into the nest
and I found that seeds were piled there at the end of the foraging period.
We were able to use a videoscope to film the interactions of ants inside the nest,
and you can see here... this is a film made with a videoscope
inside the nest. The foragers are coming in and they're engaging in antennal contact
with the outgoing foragers. There's a millet seed in the back there that you can see. So, those antennal contacts, like those,
are what determine the rate at which foragers leave, and one of the things that so fascinating to me about this
is how messy this process is. It's not as if the rate of interaction is very regular,
and each ant doesn't respond deterministically. If you've watched ants at all,
you've learned that an ant doesn't really do the same thing every time in the same circumstances,
but with very messy input and very messy output, the colony regulates its foraging
in a very predictable way. So, here's another way to illustrate
what's happening. In this story, the red ants are the returning foragers and the blue ants are the outgoing foragers,
and so the returning foragers come in with food, they don't really forage for apples
but they come in with seeds, and the meet the outgoing foragers in the tunnel,
and so as the foragers come into the tunnel they pass the outgoing foragers
and they engage in antennal contact. And eventually,
the returning forager puts down its food, which is taken by another ant shown here in green because it's not a part of this story...
it comes up from the deeper nest, gets the food, and brings it back down... and then if you look at that red ant
that just put down the food, it becomes a blue ant. It becomes an outgoing forager
and it's waiting for contact with returning foragers to decide whether to leave the nest and go out to forage.
So, we'd like to understand exactly what is the algorithm that links the rates of outgoing and returning foragers,
and to learn about this, we've been doing experiments where we decrease the rate of return
for only a few minutes. So, this shows forager rate, in minutes, and we take away the returning foragers
by using our most important piece of field equipment, the plastic box. So, we're out there picking up the ants
as they're coming back to the nest with food, with seeds, and we put them in the box,
and that causes a temporary decrease in the rate at which foragers are returning. And at the same time,
we then see, after a lag, which is interesting, a decrease in the rate at which foragers leave the nest,
and that decrease in the rate at which they leave the nest is largely than can be accounted for
by the fact that there's lots of foragers stuck in the plastic box. So, when the rate at which foragers goes in decreases,
the rate at which foragers go out decreases. When a forager goes out
depends on the rate at which foragers return with food, but not foragers returning without food.
We did some experiments early on in which we took away the few ants that come back without food and we found that it made no difference
to the rate at which foragers are leaving. So, that raises the question: do the inactive foragers,
the outgoing foragers inside the nest, respond to interactions with the returning forager,
with the food, or both? So, here we are doing what we do.
Here's Mike Greene putting little things down into the ant nest, and here I am putting little things down into the ant nest,
and the little things were small silica chips coated either with the cuticular hydrocarbons of foragers,
oleic acid, which is a common component in seeds, so this corresponds to food,
or both, or a blank control that really just had the solvent
that we used to extract the cuticular hydrocarbons. And here are the results.
It was only in response to the combination of forager hydrocarbons and food
that foraging increased. This means that the ants need both the forager and the food
to respond to the interaction in a way that stimulates foraging, and this is really interesting
because the ants put down the food shortly after they come into the nest, so by using the odor,
the combined odor of hydrocarbons and food, the ants are getting a more precise assessment
of the rate at which they're actually coming in, so this is a very interesting refinement
of the interaction network that allows them to regulate foraging more closely
to the rate at which foragers are finding food and bringing it back in.
Here's what the real data look like. This shows the rate of foragers
going in and out of the next in seconds, the whole thing is about 14 minutes, and the red line corresponds
to the rate at which foragers are coming into the nest. The blue line corresponds to the rate
at which foragers are leaving the nest, and the green bar shows the time over which we were removing returning foragers,
collecting them up of the trail and putting them in a box. So, you can see that during the time
that we're removing returning foragers, the red line, the rate at which foragers are coming in, goes way down
because we're picking up the foragers, and at the same time the rate at which foragers are leaving the nest
goes down also, because the ants inside the nest are not meeting the returning foragers. And then, we stop collecting the returning foragers,
so they start to go back, and the red line goes way up because we're not bothering them anymore,
we're not interfering anymore, and so the foragers are continuing to return. And, after a little lag, which is interesting,
the rate at which they go out picks up again and they start leaving the nest again
in response to the returning foragers. Again, what's really interesting to me about this
is how messy it is. You can see that the rate of forager return and the rate of outgoing foragers
is not very... again, what's interesting to me about this
is how messy it is, you can see that the data are quite noisy and yet the response is very predictable and strong.
The internet uses an algorithm to regulate the flow of data
that is very similar to the one that harvester ants are using to regulate the flow of foraging,
and Balaji Prabhakar and I call this analogy "Anternet".
Data doesn't leave the source unless it gets a signal
that the previous packet of data that left the source had the bandwidth to go on.
So, just as harvester ants are using the rate of return of successful foragers
as a signal that it's worth it to go out and forage, so, in the internet this protocol called TCP-IP
is ensuring that data doesn't leave the source unless it's worthwhile
because there's bandwidth for it to go on. So, especially in the early days of the internet, when it was very small
and operating costs were very high and it was really important not to lose any data,
they set it up in this way, using an algorithm very similar to the one that the harvester ants
have evolved to regulate the flow of data. And, of course, it's very interesting
that ants are using an algorithm that looks like one that we recently invented,
but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms that we know about,
and there are more than 12,000 species of ants and the ants have had more than 130 million years
to come up with interesting algorithms for data networks, so I think it's very likely
that some of the other 12,000 species of ants are going to be using algorithms that we've never even thought of.
So, now, we can ask how these interaction networks that regulate foraging are evolving in this population.
In other words, we can ask whether there's natural selection going on right now on the regulation of foraging.
Are the colonies that are making better foraging decisions showing higher reproductive success?
That is, we could try to find out if natural selection is shaping the ongoing evolution
of collective behavior in this population. Natural selection requires variation,
heritability, and differences in reproductive success due to the trait that's variable and inherited.
So, first of all, variation... we find that there is variation
in the regulation of foraging in this population of colonies. On dry days,
some colonies reduce foraging. That is, colonies are different in how they manage this tradeoff
between spending water by going out to search and getting water in the seeds that they eat.
Colonies of harvester ants live for 25-30 years,
and they show consistent behavior year after year. A particular colony
that forages less on dry days one year also forages less on dry days
another year, so this is consistent variation among colonies that persists,
apparently, as long as the colony lives. And we're trying to understand, then,
why do some colonies forage less than others, and we're doing this by thinking of the ants
as neurons and drawing on models from computational neuroscience.
So, a neuron has to add up its electrical stimulation
from other neurons to decide whether to fire.
In other words, a neuron integrates its stimulus from other neurons to make a decision about whether to fire,
and in the same way, or in an analogous way, an ant is adding up its interactions
with other ants to decide whether to go out and forage. So, what we're looking for here
would be differences among colonies in how eat ant integrates or adds up its interactions.
Maybe, in some colonies, each ant needs more interactions in order to be willing to go out and forage
and, if so, a colony with ants like that in it is going to forage less,
because it's going to take more ants returning with food before the ants go out and forage, and so for a given amount of food
a colony in which each ant requires more interactions is going to do less foraging.
So, to think more about how this might work, let's think about how ants respond to interaction rate,
and so here I'll tell you a story about how I think it might work that's analogous to the way a neuron works.
Let's imagine that each interaction stimulates some physiological response in an ant,
and that response has a decay. So, every time it experiences an interaction,
if the next interaction comes before the last one has decayed, then eventually it would have enough interactions
to push it over some activation threshold, which would then, for example,
make it very likely to go out and forage. We think that this is what happens. From our experiments
in which we can manipulate the rate of interaction by using beads coated with extracts of hydrocarbons,
it seems that the period over which an ant is responding to interactions,
the period over which an ant is accumulating its experience of interactions, is about 3-10 seconds.
This is very analogous to the way that neurons work, so we're using
integrate-and-forage models by analogy with integrate-and-fire models. Each ant is a leaky integrator of its interactions,
and we're looking for differences among colonies in how leaky they are, in this decay rate in an ants response to interactions,
to see whether we can find exactly how ants are different in different colonies
that would add up to the very large differences that we see among colonies
in how much they forage. So, we're really trying to understand the source of the variation among colonies,
and a next step will be to look for the genetic variation that might underlie this.
Now, an important component of natural selection...
a crucial component of natural selections is that variation in regulation of foraging is associated with variation in reproductive success.
In order to find out about this, we needed a measure of reproductive success.
Ants don't reproduce more ants; colonies make more colonies. And so, it hasn't really been possible
to measure the evolution of the collective behavior of social insect colonies
because we've never really been able to measure reproductive success: how many colonies does another colony produce?
But, because of my long-term data in this population, we've been able to do this.
The colony is the reproductive individual in a population of colonies, and so I want to tell you a little bit about
how a colony reproduces, how colonies produce more colonies.
This is a map of my study site. This is the map from 1993, and I have mapped this population
every year since 1985. The map shows a road along the bottom, and every point in this map
is a location of another colony, and every year I go out and find all the colonies that were there the year before,
that are on the map from the year before, I take off the ones that have died, and I put the new ones on.
And so, in this way, I've been able to track these colonies for many years. This is how colonies reproduce,
and this is a very common method of reproduction in many species of ants. So, the colonies reproduce
in an annual mating aggregation. In this species, it happens in the summer
after the rains. All of the colonies in the population send out winged reproductive males and females.
You can always tell the males from the females in ants because the males have smaller heads,
and that's because they don't live long enough to consume much food. They don't really need their head
for what they're gonna do, and so the males always have smaller heads than the females.
Then, all of the winged males and females fly to one spot where they mate,
and this shows the mating... this shows ants mating.
Here, this female, who still has her wings, is mating with that male,
and there's another male on top waiting his turn. It turns out, in this population,
because of an interesting genetic system, that each female has to mate
more than once in order to produce a viable colony that can then reproduce.
So, the females mate many times, then afterwards, the males all die,
and then the newly mated queens fly off, apparently at random, they can shrug off their wings,
and then they dig a whole, and this is the nest of a newly mated queen, dug the same day,
they go do about 18 inches, and the queen will stay there for the rest of her life,
continuing to reproduce all of the workers, the reproductive females and the males,
using the sperm from that original mating session. This is a colony five years later.
It gets to be about a meter across. The ants cover it with pebbles that they use to store the cuticular hydrocarbons
that marks their colony. And, once a colony gets to be about five years old, it doesn't get any larger,
and that's when it begins to reproduce. That is, that's when the colony makes
winged reproductive females and males to go out to that year's mating flight.
So, the story that I want to tell you is a story about mothers and daughters, and so I'm going to show you the people that worked on it
with their daughters. This is Kirsta Ingram with her daughters, Anna Pilko with her daughter,
and there I am with my daughter Eleanor. And we were able to use genetic variation
to match up parent and offspring colonies. That is, we were able to figure out
which colonies produced the daughter queens
that founded the offspring colony. So, what we're really measuring is the female component
of reproductive success: which offspring colonies were founded by daughter queens
of which parent colonies? So this was amazing for me, after all these years,
to be able to figure out who's related. This is another version of the map of my study site.
This is from 2010, which is the year that we did this, and each symbols is a nest or a colony...
each symbol is a colony, and the size of the symbol shows how many offspring they had,
and it's shown in two colors because there are two different genetic lineages in the population. You don't need to worry about that
to understand this story. And this just shows the results for one family. So, for example, from this work
I found out that colony 154, whom I've known well for many years,
is a great-grandmother. Here is her daughter, her granddaughter,
and her great-granddaughter colonies. Colony 154 happens to be a colony
that I always thought was kind of a loser, because on a really hot day colony 154 would be just...
there'd be maybe a trickle of foragers, where there were some other colonies out there, even some right nearby,
that always have lots of foragers out no matter what. But, in fact, it turns out that colony 154
is a great-grandmother. This shows all of the parent-offspring colonies
that we found in 258 colonies that were sampled in 2010,
but these were colonies of many different ages, so because we knew all of their ages we could go back,
year by year, and ask, okay, of all the colonies that are five years or older
in a given year, and could be the parents, which are the parents of the offspring colonies
produced in that year, and that's how we were able to find all of these parent-offspring relationships.
By doing this, I could ask the question, is anything about colony behavior heritable?
And it turns out that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies in their decisions about which days
it's so hot that they don't forage. The offspring and the parents are so far from each other
that the ants never meet, they're farther apart than they could possibly go in their foraging trails,
so the offspring colonies can't be learning anything from the parent colonies, and this is why we'd like to look for
the genetic variation that may underlie this resemblance, the apparent heritability of colony foraging behavior,
in parent and offspring colonies. So, if there's genetic variation
in parent and offspring colonies that explains why they resemble each other,
it seems that it would have to be genetic variation in ant response to interactions.
That is, maybe colonies in which each ant
is more likely to forage only after it gets many interactions, perhaps colonies in which the decay rate
of an ant's response to interactions is very high, so that it takes a lot of interactions to accumulate enough
to push it over the threshold to forage, maybe a colony like that is likely to have offspring colonies
that are also behaving that way, and this is what we're going to be looking for.
So, finally, the punch line: is there a relationship between colony behavior
and reproductive success? And we found that there is. So, the colonies, like colony 154,
that are more likely to conserve water and sacrifice getting as much food as possible
by reducing foraging more on a really hot day, those are the colonies
most likely to have offspring. So, it's not the colonies that go out and get the most food,
it's the colonies that save water. I think that the colonies that conserve water more
have better hydrated queens who, when they leave for the mating aggregation and have to spend the first six weeks
in their own nest before they produce the first workers who can go out to forage for them,
they may have an edge on the queens from colonies that haven't been as good
about saving water. Over the time of this study, and especially in the last 10-15 years,
there's been a very severe and deepening drought in the southwestern U.S., and it may be that natural selection
is acting this way in response to the drought, and it's certainly possible
that in different environmental conditions evolution will push... it's certainly possible that in different environmental conditions
evolution will push the regulation of foraging in another direction.
To my knowledge, this is the first time that we've been able to track the ongoing evolution
of the regulation of collective behavior in a natural population of animals.
What's happening is that more successful colonies conserve water by foraging less
in poor, dry conditions, but when conditions are good and it's more humid
those same colonies actually have more stable foraging, so natural selection is acting to shape the way that ants are using local interactions
to regulate the behavior of the colony.
Interaction networks evolve in response to environmental challenges.
By looking at how... by looking at how the regulation
of collective behavior interacts with the environment, by asking ecological questions
about collective behavior, we can learn how collective behavior evolves.
Maybe we can learn from the ants, who give us beautiful examples of collective behavior in many different environments,
how collective behavior is evolving in other environments and in other systems
like these cancer cells. Thank you.

Deborah Gordon (Stanford) 1: Local Interactions Determine Collective Behavior


I'm Deborah Gordon.
I'm a professor at Stanford,
and I'd like to talk to you today
about the evolution of collective behavior.
We see collective behavior all around us.
Here's an example of collective behavior:
it's a group of starlings turning.
They have an amazingly fluid way
of moving a flock collectively.
But, of course, there's lots of collective behavior
going on around us that we don't see.
Gene transcription networks
are a form of collective behavior.
Cells work collectively, for example,
in an embryo,
the development of an embryo and differentiation
is the result of collective behavior among cells.
Cancer cells work collectively
to establish tumors.
In a brain,
neurons work collectively to produce perception,
and memory,
and all of the functions of brains.
What all these systems have in common
is that there's no central control.
There's nobody in charge,
nobody telling anybody what to do.
I study collective behavior in ants.
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers,
those are the ants you see walking around,
and although there are reproductive females called queens,
they don't give any instructions
or tell anybody what to do.
So, instead,
ant colonies work through local interactions.
Although this is the way
that most people think about ant colonies
-- this is a silly picture that's been staged --
in fact this never happens.
There's no foremen,
there's no bureaucrats,
there are no managers...
somehow the behavior of the colony,
the way that it can respond to its environment,
arises through interactions among ants.
Systems without central control
always use networks of local interactions.
In ants, those are networks
of antennal contact
and chemical interactions.
In cells also,
those are networks of chemical interactions between cells,
and between cells and their environments.
And so, all of these interactions together
create a network.
The history of biology,
especially in the last hundred years,
has been to try to understand
the function and dynamics of networks,
and it began with trying to associate
function with type.
So, illustrated here, for example,
is the idea of one gene - one protein.
Then, in studies of neuroscience,
early on, we hoped to find particular parts of the brain,
each of which would do a certain function,
and the study of social insects
proceeded in the same way,
by looking at the minority of species
in which workers come in different sizes,
and trying to assign a function
to each type of worker.
But over time,
we've understood that, instead,
function and dynamics are produced by interactions.
In genes, there are very complex regulatory processes
that determine the relationship
between genotype and phenotype.
The function of brains arises
from interactions among many different groups of neurons
in the brain
that form circuits that interact with each other,
and in the same way,
in ant colonies,
we can see how local interactions
produce the behavior of the system.
So, ants operate mostly by smell.
Most ants can't see.
And, they smell with their antennae,
so one very important interaction among ants
is when one ant touches another with its antennae,
and when one ant touches another with its antennae,
it can tell by the odor
whether the other ant belongs to the same colony
and what task it's been doing.
So here, we see a laboratory arena.
The ants are moving around and interacting.
In this arena,
there are two tubes connecting to other arenas.
When one ant meets another,
it doesn't matter which ant it's meeting,
they're not exchanging any complicated signals or messages,
all that matters to the ant
is the rate at which it meets other ants.
Taken together,
all these interactions produce a network.
This illustrates the network and the paths
of all the ants that you saw in the film
in the previous slide.
And it's this constantly shifting
network of interactions
that produces the behavior of the system.
A brain works the same way,
but the great thing about ants
is that we can see all of the interactions
as they're happening,
and so we can see how this network of interactions
is related to the function of the system.
4 I study ants in a desert in Arizona
and I'm going to be telling you about
some of the work that I've done with harvester ants in the south...
I'm gonna be telling you about some of the work
that I've done with harvester ants
at a study site in southeast Arizona.
This is what the nest of a mature colony looks like.
You can see the nest entrance,
and then there's a trail leading away from the nest entrance,
sometimes cleared and sometimes not,
that goes about 20 meters,
and these ants are called harvester ants
because they eat seeds.
So, they travel along this trail,
collect seeds, and bring them back to the nest.
And, I divide all the behavior that I see outside the nest
into these four categories:
foraging, that's going out and collecting seeds
and bringing it back,
then the patrollers, shown here with a magnifying glass,
are an interesting group of workers
that go out early in the morning,
they move around the foraging area,
they meet the neighbors...
they meet the ants of the other neighboring colonies,
and it's their safe return
that signals the foragers that it's time to go out.
The nest maintenance workers work inside the nest.
They line the walls of the chambers
with moist soil that dries to a kind of adobe finish,
and then they carry out the dry soil.
So, you see nest maintenance workers
coming out, putting down soil, and going back in.
And finally, the midden workers
work on the refuse pile, or midden,
where they put a colony-specific odor
that helps guide foragers back into the nest.
It's only about 25% of the colony
that works outside the nest,
so these four task groups that I told you about
are only 25% of the colony.
Deep inside the nest,
which goes down a meter, sometimes two,
there are ants that are storing the seeds
and processing the seeds.
The queen is down somewhere,
she just lays the eggs.
Then, there are ants
that are feeing the larvae and brood.
It's actually the larvae that consume most of the food.
And, despite what it says in the...
and, despite what it says in the bible
about how hard-working ants are,
there are a lot of ants
that are just hanging around doing nothing,
and it's a very interesting question about the function of the network,
why the colonies...
it's a very interesting question
about how that group of reserve,
or inactive colonies
might function to contribute to regulating
the network of interactions.
In this species, as in most ant species,
all of the ants are the same size,
so you can't identify the task of an ant by its size,
but you can identify the task of an ant
by what it's doing.
And it turns out that ants change tasks.
So, this shows the results of experiments
in which I created a need
for more ants to do a certain task.
So, the arrows point to the...
the arrows show the outcome
of experiments where I created a need for more ants
doing that task.
So, for example,
if more ants are needed to forage,
then the patrollers will change to forage,
the midden workers will change to forage,
and the nest maintenance workers will change to forage.
In response to a lot of really exciting new food
that I put out there,
everybody will switch to forage.
If there's a need for more patrollers,
so for example, if I create a disturbance,
then the nest maintenance workers
will switch to do patrolling,
but if more ants are needed to do nest maintenance,
so for example, if I create a mess that the nest maintenance workers
have to clean up,
then none of the others will switch back
to do nest maintenance work,
and they have to go new nest maintenance workers
from the younger ants inside the nest.
So, there's a one-way flow of ants
from the younger ants inside the nest,
through nest maintenance,
some of them become patrollers,
and everybody eventually ends up as a forager,
and once an ant is a forager, it doesn't come back.
All of this is regulated
by the interactions of the ants
as they come in and out of the nest,
and so this process
that I call task allocation
is the process at the level of the colony
that gets the right numbers of ants
to each task in a given situation,
and so now we understand
that it's this regulatory process of task allocation
that determines how the system functions,
not the inherent characteristics of any particular ant,
but the regulation of the whole system
that shifts ants around
into different tasks
as they're needed in changing conditions.
So, this raises the question,
how do these interaction networks evolve?
How does evolution shape the regulation
of a system with no central control?
I'd like to begin with a quote from Dobzhansky,
that "nothing in biology makes sense
except in the light of evolution,"
and to modify that in my own way
by saying that nothing in evolution makes sense
except in the light of ecology,
and what I'd like to do now
is to explain that in more detail.
So, ecology comes from the words for village.
Ecology is about how different parts of a system interact,
and we think of ecology
in terms of interactions at different levels.
First, interactions among individuals
like the trees shown here,
and then interactions within a population
and between populations,
where a population is the set of all individuals
that may reproduce with each other.
So, populations are defined in terms of reproduction.
And then a community
is all of the populations that are living together
and interacting in a certain place,
so here, there are some birds in the forest.
Of course there are many, many kinds of organisms
in the community that that forest is part of.
And we could go even one level up
and think about the interactions
between all of those organisms
and all of the other factors that affect them,
like the air, and the water, and the wind,
and all of the chemicals that are circulating
through the system.
Ecology is the science
that helps us to understand
how all of the interactions lead to changes in a system.
And so when we want to ask,
how do interaction networks evolve,
we really have to ask,
how does evolution
react to the interactions within the system?
So, we have to think about ecology to understand evolution.
Another way to think about the relationship
between ecology and evolution
is to think about what natural selection really is.
Natural selection requires three conditions.
First, there has to be variation in a trait,
and we can think of a trait as anything.
It could be eye color,
or the height of a tree,
or the time of year that the tree flowers,
or how the thick the polar bear's fur is.
A trait could be anything,
including how individuals within a system
interact to regulate that system.
So, first of all, there has to be variation.
Then, that trait has to be heritable,
because natural selection
acts over many generations,
and if the trait isn't heritable,
if the offspring don't resemble their parents,
then over many generations
things might reshuffle
but there will be no trends.
And finally,
and here's where the ecology comes in,
there has to be...
and finally, here's where the ecology comes in,
there have to be differences
in reproductive success
related to the trait.
The trait has to make a difference ecologically
to how the organisms survive and reproduce.
So, here's a diagram to illustrate that.
So here,
let's imagine that we have lots of individuals in a population,
and each row in this diagram
is gonna be a different generation,
and the different colors represent the trait,
so the trait here is color,
and some of them are blue,
some are red,
some are orange.
That's the variation in the trait,
so there's variation to start out with.
And then, that trait is heritable,
so blue circles make more blue circles,
red circles make more red circles,
orange circles make more orange circles...
the offspring resemble their parents,
so it's heritable.
And now, here's where the ecology comes in.
In order for their to be any change over generations,
some of these individuals have to reproduce more than others,
and in this story let's say that it's really great,
ecologically, to be orange.
And so, over generations,
there will be more orange individuals,
because their ecology is such
that they can reproduce more.
And here we get natural selection,
a change over many generations,
in the frequency of individuals that are orange.
That's how natural selection works,
and it always requires an ecological process
that affects the reproductive success
of the trait
in such a way that some individuals
reproduce more than others.
So, when we ask,
how do interaction networks evolve,
really we're asking an ecological question
about why networks function differently
in a given environment
so that some forms of an interaction network
allow more reproduction than others.
So, we could ask this question about cancer cells.
We could ask,
why is it that certain ecological conditions
within a body
allow the evolution of particular types of cancer,
and allow the cancer cells
to change over generations of cells?
That's a difficult question, although it's one that's really important,
and we can also ask the same kind of question
about ant colonies.
And there, because we can see the interactions
among ants
and we can look at them in their environments,
we have the opportunity to learn
how interaction networks
are evolving in certain environments.
So, there are more than 12,000 species of ants.
They live in every conceivable habitat on Earth,
and they all have to solve ecological problems
because they have to explore their environments,
they have to get resources,
and then they have to reproduce.
And when we look at different species,
we can see how interaction networks
are evolving to work differently in different environments.
So, one species that we study in my lab
is the Argentine ant.
It's an invasive species.
They came from Argentina,
they have spread around the world,
and everywhere that there's a Mediterranean climate,
there now are Argentine ants,
on the coast of California,
the coast of South Africa, Australia,
the whole Mediterranean coastline,
Japan, Hawaii...
And one of the interesting things
about how their interaction networks operate
is how different they are from other ant species.
Many ant species use interaction networks
to create what is called central place foraging.
So, you can think of it like a broom.
The ants all live in one nest,
they go out to forage, and they bring their resources
all back to the central nest.
But, Argentine ants, like other species,
are really good at a different kind of strategy.
They make circuits,
it's more like a vacuum cleaner.
They move from nest to nest, they have many different nests,
they move from nest to nest
and they sweep up resources as they go.
So, they create a different kind of interaction network
that functions differently
from the species that use central place foraging.
And one of the things that we've been studying
is how new paths form,
and we find that Argentine ants
actually recruit from the trail and not from the nest.
That is, they create a large network like the vacuum cleaner
going around.
If you're operating a vacuum cleaner,
instead of going all the way back
to a corner of a room all the time,
you keep moving the vacuum cleaner from wherever you are,
and that's the way that Argentine ants work also.
In the tropics, we see different kinds of interaction networks.
One of the species that we're studying
is the turtle ant,
and here you can see ants marked...
those green ants
and the pink ants
are marked with nail polish by us,
they're not really that color,
and we did that in order to see how ants
are allocated on different trails.
And what we find is that ants create circuits in the trees,
ongoing circuits, again, like a vacuum cleaner,
from a nest to another nest,
fort to a food source,
so the ants create a circuit in the trees
from nest to food sources and back again,
around and around,
and those circuits are shaped by negative interactions
with the ants of another colony.
So for example, here you can see
another Cephalotes species
plugging up its nest entrance with its head
in response to negative interactions
with a different species,
those smaller ones running around with their abdomens in the air,
and so this species has a form of security
that's based on interactions with ants of other species,
and they regulate the flow of ants
in and out of the nest based on those interactions.
So, ants are using interactions differently
in a huge range of environments,
and we can study the evolution of collective behavior
by understanding, ecologically,
how the function of a network in one environment
affects the reproductive success of the colonies
using that network.
Interaction networks
evolve in response to environmental challenges,
and so the way to study the evolution of collective behavior
is to try to understand
how interaction networks
are operating in particular environments,
and what that means for the survival
and reproductive success
of the system using those networks.
