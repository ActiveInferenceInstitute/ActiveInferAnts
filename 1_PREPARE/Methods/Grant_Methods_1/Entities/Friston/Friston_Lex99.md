How much of the human brain do we understand? How much of the human brain do we understand from the low level of neuronal communication to the functional level to the highest level, maybe the psychiatric disorder level? Well, we're certainly in a better position than we were last century. How far we've got to go, I think, is almost an unanswerable question. So you'd have to set the parameters, you know, what constitutes understanding, what level of understanding do you want. I think we've made enormous progress in terms of broad-brush principles. Whether that affords a detailed cartography of the functional anatomy of the brain and what it doesn't write down to the microcircuitry in the neurons, that's probably out of reach at the present time. So the cartography, so mapping of the brain, do you think mapping of the brain, the detailed perfect imaging of it, does that get us closer to understanding of the mind of the brain? So how far does it get us if we have the perfect cartography of the brain? I think there are lower bounds on that. It's a really interesting question, and it would determine this sort of scientific career you'd pursue. If you believe that knowing every dendritic connection, every sort of microscopic synaptic structure, and right down to the molecular level was gonna give you the right kind of information to understand the computational nature, then you choose to be microscopic and you would study little cubic millimeters of brain for the rest of your life. If, on the other hand, you were interested in holistic functions and a sort of functional anatomy of the sort that a neuropsychologist would understand, you'd study brain lesions and strokes, you know, just looking at the whole person. So again, it comes back to, I won't level do you want understanding. I think there are principled reasons not to go too far. If you commit to a view of the brain as a machine that's performing a form of inference and representing things, there are the understanding that level our understanding is necessarily cast in terms of probability densities and ensemble densities distributions. And what that tells you is that you don't really want to look at the atoms to understand the thermodynamics of probabilistic descriptions for how the brain works. So I personally wouldn't look at the molecules or indeed the single neurons in the same way. If I wanted and understand the thermodynamics of some non-equilibrium steady state of a gas or an active material, I wouldn't spend my life looking at the individual molecules that constituted there. On somebody look at their collective behavior. On the other hand, if you go to coarse grain, you're gonna miss some basic canonical principles of connectivity and architectures. I'm thinking here this bitkha local but this current excitement about high field magnetic resonance imaging and seven tests that why. Well, it gives us for the first time the opportunity to look at the brain in action at the level of a few millimeters that distinguish between different layers of the cortex that may be very important in terms of evincing generic principles of canonical microcircuitry that are replicated throughout the brain there may tell us something fundamental about message passing in the brain and these density dynamics of on your own ensemble population dynamics that underwrite our, you know, our brain function. So somewhere between a millimeter and a meter.

Most beautiful characteristic of the human brain Lingering for a bit under and the big questions, if you allow me, what to you is the most beautiful or surprising characteristic of the human brain? I think it's hierarchical and recursive aspect, its recurrent aspect of the structure or of the actual representation of power of the brain. Well, I think one speaks to the other. I was actually answering in a dell minded way from the point of view of purely its anatomy and and its structural aspects. I mean, there are many marvelous organs in the body. Let's take your liver, for example. You know, without it, you wouldn't you wouldn't be around for very long, and he does some beautiful delicate biochemistry and homeostasis and you're evolved with a finesse that would easily parallel the brain. But he doesn't have a beautiful anatomy. He has a simple atomy which is attractive in a minimalist sense, but it doesn't have that crafted structure of sparse connectivity and that recurrence and that specialization that the brain has. So you said a lot of interesting terms here. So the recurrence, the sparsity, but you also started by saying hierarchical. So I've I've never thought of our brain as hierarchical sort of. I always thought is just like a giant mess, an interconnected mess, was very difficult to figure anything out. But in what sense do you see the brain is hierarchical? Well, I see it's not a magic soup. Yeah, of course it's what I used to think when I was before I studied medicine and the like. So a lot of those terms imply each other. So hierarchies, if you just think about the nature of a hierarchy, how would you actually build one and what you would have to do is basically carefully remove the right connections that destroy the completely connected soups that you might have in mind. So a hierarchy is in and of itself defined by a sparse and particular connectivity structure. I'm not committing to any particular form of hierarchy. Your senses there is some. Oh, absolutely, in virtue of the fact that there is a sparsity of connectivity, not necessarily of a quality. It's obvious and if a quantitative sort. So they are, it is demonstrably so and that they've far further apart two parts of the brain are, the less likely that they are to be wired, you know, to possess axonal processes, neuronal processes that directly communicate one message or messages from one part of the brain to the other part of the brain. So we know there's a sparse connectivity, and furthermore, on the basis of anatomical connectivity and traces studies, we know that that a that has that sparsity under writes a higher high rock on a very structured sort of connectivity that might be best understood like a little bit like an onion, you know, that there there is a concentric sometimes refer to as centripetal by people like Marcel Mesulam hierarchical organization to the brain. So you can think of the brain as in a rough sense like an onion and all the sensory information and all the afferent outgoing messages that supply commands to your muscles or to your secrete ryokans come from the surface. So there's a massive exchange interface with the world out there on the surface, and then underneath there's a little layer that sits and looks at the exchange on the surface, and then underneath that there's a layer right there way down to the very center through the deepest part of the onion. That's what I mean by a mirror hierarchical organization. There's a discernible structure defined by the sparsity of connections that lends the architecture a hierarchical structure that tells one a lot about the kinds of representations and messages. So karate on any question is this about the representational capacity or is it about the anatomy? Well, one under writes the other, you know, if one this simply thinks of the brain as a message passing machine, a process that is in the service of doing something, then the the circuitry and the connectivity that shape that message passing also dictate its function.

Brain imaging So you've done a lot of amazing work in a lot of directions. So let's look at one aspect of that of looking into the brain and trying to study this onion structure of what can we learn about the brain by imaging it, which is one way to sort of look at the anatomy of it broadly speaking. What are the methods of imaging but even bigger what can we learn about it right? So well, most imaging human neural imaging you might see, you know, in science journals, speaks to the way the brain works measures brain activity over time. So you know, that's the first thing to say. The way we're effectively looking at fluctuations in neuronal responses usually in response to some sensory input or some instruction, some task, not necessarily, and there's a lot of interest in just looking at the brain in terms of resting state endogenous or intrinsic activity. But crucially at every point looking at these fluctuations either induced or intrinsic in the neural activity and understanding them at two levels. So normally people would recourse to two principles of brain or kin organization that are complimentary. One functional specialization or segregation. So what does that mean? It simply means that there are certain parts of the brain that may be specialized for certain kinds of processing, you know, for example visual motion, our ability to recognize or to perceive movement in the visual world. And furthermore, that specialized processing may be spatially or anatomically segregated leading to functional segregation, which means that if I were to compare your brain activity during a period of studying viewing a static image and then compare that to the responses of fluctuations in the brain when you are exposed to a moving image, say a flying bird, I would expect to see restricted segregated differences in activity and those are basically the hot spots that you see in me in surgical parametric maps that test for the significance of the responses that are circumscribed. So now basically we're talking about some people of perhaps and currently Calder and neocartography. This is a phrenology augmented by modern day near imaging, basically finding blobs or bumps on the brain that do this or do that and trying to understand the cartography of that functional specialization. So how much, how much is there such, this is such a beautiful sort of ideal to strive for. We humans scientists would like you like this to hope that there is a beautiful structure to this, was like you said there are segregated regions that are responsible for the different function. How much hope is there to find such regions in terms of looking at the progress of studying the brain? Oh, I think in Nomis progress has been made in the past, you know, 20 or 30 years. You know, so this is beyond incremental. You know, at the advent of brain imaging the very notion of functional segregation was just a hypothesis based upon a century, if not more, of careful neuropsychology looking at people who had lost via insult or traumatic brain injury particular parts of the brain and then saying, well, they can't do this or they can't do that. For example, losing the visual cortex and not being able to see, or using losing particular parts of the visual cortex or regions known as v5 or the middle temporal region MT, noticing that they selectively could not see moving things. And so that created the hypothesis that perhaps movement processing, visual movement processing was located in this functionally segregated area. And you could then put, go and put invasive electrodes in animal models and say, yes indeed, we can excite activity here, we can form receptive fields that are sensitive to or defined in terms of visual motion. But at no point could you exclude the possibility that everywhere else in the brain was also very interested in visual motion. By the way, I apologize to interrupt, buzz tiny little tangent, you said animal models. Just out of curiosity, from your perspective, how different is the human brain versus the other animals in terms of our ability to study the brain? Well, clearly, the far further away you go from a human brain, the greater the difference is, but not as remarkable as you might think. So people will choose their level of approximation to the human brain depending upon the other kinds of questions that they want to answer. So if you're talking about sort of canonical principles of microcircuitry, it might be perfectly okay to look at a mouse. Indeed, you could even look at flies, worms. If, on the other hand, you wanted to look at the finer details of organization of visual cortex and v1 v2, there's a designated sort of patches of cortex that may or may do different things indeed, you probably want to use a primate that looked a little bit more like a human because there are lots of ethical issues in terms of, you know, the use of non-human primates to transfer questions about the about human anatomy. I think most people assume that the most of the important principles are conserved in a continuous way, you know, from right from, well, yes, worms right to yummy. So now returning to, so that was the early of ideas are studying the really functional regions of the brain base if there's some damage to it to try to infer that there's that part of the brain might be somewhat responsible for this type of function. So what where does that lead us? What are the next steps beyond that right? Well, this actually reverse a bit, come back to your sort of notion that the brain is a magic soup, but that was actually a very prominent idea at one point. Notions such as Lashley's law of mass action inherited from the observation that for serve animals, if you just took out spoonfuls of the brain, it didn't matter where you took these spoonfuls out, they always showed the same kinds of deficits. So you know, it was very difficult to infer functional specialization pure on the base basis of lesion deficit studies. But once we had the opportunity to look on the brain or lighting up in its, it's literally it's sort of excitement, neuronal AM excitement when looking at this versus that, one was able to say, yes indeed, these functionally specialized responses are very restricted and then they're here or they're over there. If I do this, then this part of the brain lights up. And that became doable in the early 90s, in fact shortly before with the advent of positron emission tomography, and then functional magnetic resonance imaging came along in the early 90s. And since that time, there has been an explosion of discovery, refinement, confirmation. You know, there are people who believe that it's all in the anatomy. If you understand the anatomy, then you understand the function at some level. And many, many hypotheses were predicated on a deep understanding of the anatomy and the connectivity, but they were all confirmed and taking much further with newer imaging. So that's what I meant by we've made an enormous amount of progress in this century, indeed and in relation to the previous century, by looking at these funky selective responses. But that wasn't the whole story. So there's a sort of near phrenology but finding bumps and hotspots in the brain that did this or that. The bigger question was, of course, the functional integration, how all of these regionally specific responses were orchestrated, how they were distributed, how did they relate to distributed processing and indeed representations in the brain. So then you turn to the more challenging issue of the integration, the connectivity, and then we come back to this beautiful sparse recurrent hierarchical connectivity that seems characteristic of the brain and probably not many other organs. And but nevertheless, we'll come back to this challenge of trying to figure out how everything is integrated. But what's your feeling, what's the general consensus, how we moved away from the magic soup view of the brain? Yes, so there is a deep structure to it. Yeah, that and then maybe further question, you said some people believe that the structure is most of it, that you can really get at the core of the function by just deeply understanding the structure. Yeah, where do you sit on that? Do you think it's called some monster? Yes, yeah, yes, it's a worthy pursuit of going of studying of through imaging and all the different methods to actually study. No, absolutely.

Deep structure Let's go. Yeah, yeah, sorry. I'm just, I'm just nutty you, you, you were accusing me of using lots of long words and then you introduce one that which is deep, which is interesting and because deep is this or Millenial equivalent of hierarchical. So if you've put a deep in front of anything, you're very millennial and start trending. But you, yes, you're also implying a hierarchical architecture. So that's it, is a depth which is for me the beautiful thing. That's right, the word deep kind of, yeah, exactly, it implies hierarchy. I didn't even think about that, that indeed the implicit meaning of the word deep is a hierarchy. Yep, yeah, yeah. So deep inside the onion is a central view.

not many other organs and but

nevertheless we'll come back to this

this challenge of trying to figure out

how everything is integrated but what's

your feeling what's the general

consensus how we moved away from the

magic soup view of the brain yes so

there is a deep structure to it yeah

that and then maybe further question you

said some people believe that the

structure is most of it that you can

really get at the core of the function

by just deeply understanding the

structure yeah where do you sit on that

do you

I think it's called some monster yes

yeah yes it's a worthy pursuit of going

of studying of through imaging and all

the different methods to actually study

no absolutely let's go yeah yeah sorry

Deep structure
I'm just I'm just nutty you you you were

accusing me of using lots of long words

and then you introduce one that which is

deep which is interesting and because

deep is this or Millenial equivalent of

hierarchical so if you've put a deep in

front of anything

you're very millennial and start

trending but you yes you're also

implying a hierarchical architecture so

that's it is a depth which is for me the

beautiful thing that's right the word

deep kind of yeah exactly it implies

hierarchy I didn't even think about that

that indeed the implicit meaning of the

word deep is a hierarchy yep yeah yeah

so deep inside the onion is a central

view so if you put maybe briefly if you

History of brain imaging
could paint a picture of the kind of

methods of neuro imaging maybe the

history which you are a part of you know

from statistical parametric mapping I

mean just what what's out there that's

interesting for people maybe outside the

field that to understand of what are the

actual methodologies of looking inside

the human brain right well there you can

answer that question from two

perspectives basically it's the modality

you know what kind of signal are you

measuring and they can range from and

let's limit ourselves to some imaging

based non-invasive

techniques so you've essentially got

brain scanners and Brent's cannons can

either measure the structural attributes

the amount of water of the Mount of fat

on the amount of iron in different parts

of the brain you can make lots of

inferences about the structure of the

organ of the sort that you might have

abuse from an x-ray but a you know a

very nuanced x-ray that is looking at

this kind of property of that kind of

property so looking at the anatomy not

invasively

is would be the first sort of earner

imaging that people might want to employ

then you move on to the kinds of

measurements that reflect dynamic

function the most prevalent of those

fall into two camps you've got these

metabolic sometimes hemodynamic blood

related signals so these metabolic

and/or hemodynamic signals are basic

proxies for elevated activity and

message passing and neuronal dynamics in

particular parts of the brain

characteristically though the time

constants of these hemodynamic or

metabolic responses to neural activity

are much longer than the neural activity

itself and this is uh this is refering

forgive me for the dumb questions but

this would be referring to blood like

the flow of blood absolutely

so there's a ton of it seems like

there's a ton of blood vessels in the

brain yeah so but what's the interaction

between the flow of blood and the

function of the new and neurons is there

an interplay there or yeah yeah yeah and

that interplay accounts for several

careers of world-renown solutely so this

is known as neurovascular coupling is

exactly what you said it's how how does

a neural activity the neuronal

infrastructure natural message passing

that we think underlies our capacity to

perceive and act how is that coupled to

the vascular responses that that supply

the energy for that neural processing so

there's a delicate web or

of large vessels arteries and veins that

gets progressively finer and finer in

detail until it perfuses at a

microscopic level the machinery where

little neurons lie so coming back to

this sort of onion perspective we were

talking before using the onion there's a

metaphor for a deep hierarchical

structure but also I think it's just an

anatomical anatomically quite a useful

metaphor all the action all the heavy

lifting in terms neural computation is

done on the surface of the brain and

then the interior of the brain is

constituted by fatty wires essentially

axonal processes that are enshrouded by

myelin sheaths and these give the ER

when you dissect them they look fatty

and white and so it's called white

matter as opposed to the actual neuro

peel which does the computation

constituted largely by neurons and

that's known as gray matter so the gray

matter is a a a surface or a skin that

sits on top of this big ball now we are

talking magic soup but it's a big ball

of collections like spaghetti very

carefully structured with sparse

connectivity that preserve this deep

hierarchical structure but all the

action takes place on the surface on the

cortex of the onion and that means that

you have to supply the right amount of

blood flow the right amount of nutrient

which is rapidly absorbed and used by

neural cells that don't have the same

capacity that your leg muscles would

have to basically spend their energy

budget and then claim it back later

so one peculiar thing about cerebral

metabolism brain metabolism is it really

needs to be driven in the moment which

means you basically have to turn on the

taps so if there's lots of neural

activity in one part of the brain a

little patch of a cup few millimeters

even less possibly you really do have to

water that piece of the garden now and

quickly and that by quickly I mean

within a couple of seconds so that

contains a lot of infant

the imaging could tell you a story of

what's happening absolutely but it is

slightly compromised in terms of the

resolution so the the deployment of

these little micro vessels that the

water the garden to enable the activity

to to the neural activity to play out

the the spatial resolution is in order

of a few millimeters and crucially the

temporal resolution is the order of a

few seconds so you can't get right down

and dirty into the actual spatial and

temporal scale of neuronal activity in

and of itself to do that you'd have to

turn to the other big imaging modality

which is the recording of

electromagnetic signals as they're

generated in real time so here the

temporal bandwidth if you like on the

temp the low limit on the temporal

resolution is incredibly small you're

talking about near nalle' seconds

milliseconds and then you can get into

the phasic fast responses there is in of

itself the neural activity and start to

see the succession or cascade of

hierarchal recurrent message-passing

evoked by a particular stimulus but the

problem is you're looking at

electromagnetic signals that have passed

through an enormous amount of magic soup

or spaghetti of collectivity and through

the scalp and the skull and it's become

spatially very diffused so it's very

difficult to know where you are so

you've got this sort of catch-22 you can

either use an imaging modality it tells

you within millimeters which part of the

brain is activated we don't know when or

you've got these electromagnetic a EEG m

EG setups that tell you to within a few

milliseconds when folks something has

responded being aware so you've got

these two complementary measures either

in direct via the blood flow or direct

via the electromagnetic signals caused

by neural activity these are the two big

imaging devices and

the second level of responses your

question what what are they yeah from

the outside one of the big ways of of

using this technology so once you've

chosen your the kind of mirror imaging

they want to use to answer your set

questions and sometimes it would have to

be both then you've got a whole raft of

analyses time series analysis usually

that you can bring to bear in order to

answer your questions or address your

hypothesis about those data and

interesting that they they've both fall

into the same two camps we're talking

about before you know this dialectic

between specialization and integration

differentiation and integration so it's

the cartography that blob ology analyses

my apology and probably shouldn't

transfer much but just the herd of fun

word the blur the robot ology blood

ology its ideologies of which means the

study of blobs that's nothing for are

you being witty and humorous or is there

an actual there's the word blob ology

ever appear in a text book somewhere it

would appear in a popular book it would

not appear in a worthy specialist

journal yeah it's the fond word for the

study of literally little blobs on brain

maps showing activations so the kind of

thing that you'd see in you know the

newspapers on ABC or BBC reporting the

latest finding from a from brain imaging

interestingly though the maths involved

in that stream of analysis does actually

call upon the mathematics of blobs so

seriously they actually called Euler

characteristics and you know they have a

lot of fancy names in mathematics we'll

talk about about your ideas in free

energy principle I mean there's a echoes

of blobs there when you consider sort of

entities so mathematically speaking yes

absolutely yeah yes anyway well the

first circumscribe well-defined

yes--you entities of

well in from the free energy point of

view entities of anything but from the

point of view of the analysis the

cartography of you know of the brain

these are the entities that constitute

the evidence for this functional

segregation you have segregated this

function in this blob alledge is not

outside of the blob

that's basically the oh if you were a

map maker of America and you did not

know instruction the first thing were

you doing constituting or creating a map

will be to identify the cities for

example or the route mountains and all

the rivers all of these uniquely

spatially localizable features possibly

topological features have to be placed

somewhere because that requires our

mathematics of identify what does a set

it City look like on a satellite image

or what does a river look like I want as

a mountain look like what would it you

know what data features wood is wood

evidence that that particular table you

know that particular thing that you

wanted to put on the map and they

normally are characterized in terms of

literally these blobs or these of now

the way looking at and this is a certain

statistical measure of the degree of

activation crosses a threshold and in

crossing that threshold in a spatially

restricted part of the brain it creates

a blob and that's basically what

physical parametric mapping does it's

basically mathematically finessed

phlebology okay so those you kind of

describe these two methodologies for one

is temporally noisy one is spatially

noisy and you kind of have to play and

figure out what what can be useful yeah

it'd be great if you can sort of comment

Neuralink and brain-computer interfaces
I got a chance recently to spend a day

at a company called neural link that

uses brain computer interfaces and their

dream is to well there's a bunch of sort

of dreams but one of them is to

understand the brain by sort of you know

getting in there past the so calls that

are factory wall getting in there be

able to listen communicate both

directions what are your

about this the future of this kind of

technology of brain computer interfaces

to be able to now have a have a window

or direct contact within the brain to be

able to measure some of the signals to

be able to send signals to understand

some of the functionality of the brain

ambivalent my sense is ambivalent so

it's a mixture of good and bad and I

acknowledge that freely so the good bits

if you just look at the legacy of that

kind of reciprocal but invasive geo

brain stimulation I didn't paint a

complete picture when I was talking

about some of the ways we understand the

brain prior to your imaging it wasn't

just leave lesion deficit studies some

of the early work in fact literally a

hundred years from where we're sitting

at the institution neurology what was

done by stimulating the brain of say

dogs and looking at how they responded

either but with them the muscles or with

the salivation and imputing what that

part of the brain must be doing that if

i stimulated then yeah and i vote this

kind of response then that tells me

quite a lot about the functional

specialization so there's a long history

of brain stimulation which in continues

to enjoy a lot of attention nowadays

positive attention oh yes absolutely

you know deep brain stimulation for

Parkinson's disease is now a standard

treatment and also a wonderful vehicle

to try and understand the neuronal

dynamics underlie movement disorders

like Parkinson's disease even interest

in transmitting its magnetic stimulation

stimulating with the magnetic fields and

will it work in people who depressed for

example quite a crude level of

understanding what you're doing but you

know there are there is historical

evidence that these kinds of brute force

and interventions do change things then

you know a little bit like buying the TV

whether the valves are working properly

but it still it works so

you know there is a long history brain

computer interfacing a BCI

I think is a beautiful example of that

it's sort of carved out its own lesion

its own aspirations and they've been

enormous advances within limits advances

in terms of our ability to understand

how the brain the embodied brain engages

with the world I'm thinking of here of

sensory substitution the augmenting our

sensory capacities by giving ourselves

extra ways of sensing than sampling the

world ranging from sort of trying to

replace lost visual signals through to

giving people completely new signals so

the well I think most engaging examples

of this is equipping people with a sense

of magnetic fields so you can actually

give them magnetic sensors that enable

them to feel should we say tactile

pressure around their tummy where they

are in relation to them to the magnetic

field of the earth incredible and after

a few weeks they take it for granted

they integrated the embody assimilate

this new sensory information into the

way that they feet literally feel their

world were now equipped with this sense

of magnetic direction so that tells you

something about the brain's plastic

potential to remodel to in term and its

plastic capacity to suddenly try to

explain the sensory data at hand by

augmenting or augmenting the the sensory

sphere and the kinds of things that you

can measure clearly that's purely for

entertainment and understanding the knee

or the nature and the power of our

brains I would imagine the most BCI is

pitched at solving clinical and human

problems such as locked-in syndrome

paraplegia or replacing lost sensory

capacitors like blindness and death

deafness so then we come to the more on

the negative part of my own the other

side of it so I you know I don't want to

be deflation because much of my

deflationary comments was probably large

out of ignorance there anything else but

generally speaking the the bandwidth and

the bit rates that you get from brink of

Pewter interfaces as we currently know

them we're talking about bits per second

so that would be like me only being able

to communicate with any world or with

you using very very very slow Morse code

and it is not in the in even within an

order of magnitude near what we actually

need for an inactive realization of what

people aspire to when they think about

sort of curing people with paraplegia or

replacing site despite heroic efforts so

one has to ask is there a lower bound on

the kinds of recurrent information

exchange between a brain and some

augmented or artificial interface and

let me come back to interestingly what I

was talking about before which is your

if you're talking about function in

terms of inference and I presume we'll

get to that later on in terms of the

free energy principle Minh the moment

they may be fundamental reasons to

assume that is the case we talk about

ensemble activity we're talking about

basically for example let's paint

challenge facing brain-computer of

interfacing in terms of controlling

another system that is highly and deeply

structured very relevant to our lives

very nonlinear the rests upon the kind

of non-equilibrium steady states and

dynamics that the brain does the weather

right so good example here imagine you

had some very aggressive satellites that

could produce signals that could be

termed some little parts of the of the

weather system and then what you're

asking now is can i meaningfully get

into the weather and change it

meaningfully and make the weather

respond in a way that I want it to

you're talking about chaos control on a

scale which is almost unimaginable so

there may be fundamental reasons why BCI

as you might read about it in a science

fiction novel aspirational BCI may never

actually work in the sense that to

really be integrated and be part of the

system isn't impermanent requires you to

have evolved with that system that you

know you you have to be part of a very

delicately structured deeply structured

dynamic ensemble activity that is not

like rewiring a broken computer or

plugging in a peripheral interface

adapter it is much more like getting

into the weather pans or a come back to

your magic soup is getting into the

active matter and meaningfully relate

that to the outside world so I think

there are an enormous challenges there

so I think the example the weather is a

brilliant one and I think you paint a

really interesting picture and it wasn't

as negative as they thought it's

essentially saying there's it might be

incredibly challenging including the

lower bound of the bandwidth and so on I

kind of so and just to full disclosure I

come from the machine learning world so

my my

natural thought is the hardest part is

the engineering challenge of controlling

the weather of getting those satellites

up and running in and so on and once

they are then the rest is of

fundamentally the same approaches that

allow you to be to win in the game of Go

will allow you to potentially play in

this soup in this chaos so I have I have

a hope that so machine learning methods

will will help us play in the soup as

but perhaps you're right that it is a

via biology and the brain is just an

incredible an incredible system that may

be almost impossible to get in but for

me what seems impossible is is the

incredible mess of blood vessels that

you also described without you know we

also value the brain you can't make any

mistakes you can't damage things so to

me that engineering challenge seems

nearly impossible one of the things I

was really impressed by at neuro-link is

just just talking to brilliant

neurosurgeons and the roboticists that

it made me realize that even though it

seems impossible if anyone can do it

it's some of these world-class engineers

that are trying to take it on so so I

think the conclusion of our discussion

here is of this part is is basically

that the problem is really hard but

hopefully not impossible absolutely so

if it's ok let's start with the basics

Free energy principle
so you've also formulated a fascinating

principle the free energy principle

could we maybe start at the basics and

what is the free energy principle well

in fact the free energy principle

inherits a lot from the building of

these data analytic approaches to these

you know very high dimensional time soon

as you get get from the brain so I think

is interesting to acknowledge that and

in particular the analysis tools that

try to address the other side which is a

functional integrations on the

connectivity analyses on the one hand

but I should also acknowledge it

inherits an awful lot from machine

learning as well so the free energy

principle and is just a formal statement

that the the existential imperatives for

any system that manages to survive in a

changing world

is can be cast as a an inference problem

in the sense that you can interpret the

probability of existing as the evidence

that you exist and if you can write down

that problem of existence as a

statistical problem that you can use all

the maths that has been developed for

inference to understand and characterize

the ensemble dynamics that must be in

play in the service of that inference so

technically what that means is you can

always interpret anything that exists in

virtue or being separate from the

environment in which it exists as trying

to minimize variational free-energy and

if you're from the machine learning

community you will know that as a

negative evidence lower bound or a

negative elbow which is the same as

saying you're trying to maximize or it

will look as if all your dynamics are

trying to maximize the complement of

that which is the marginal likelihood or

the evidence for your own existence so

that's basically that you know that the

free energy principle of it but even

take a sort of a small step back or as

you said the existential imperative

there's a lot of beautiful poetic words

here but to put it crudely there's a

it's a fascinating idea of basically

just of trying to describe if you're

looking at a blob how do you know this

thing is alive

what does it mean to be alive what does

it mean to be to exist and so you can

look at the brain you can look at parts

of the brain or you this is just the

general principle that applies to almost

thing and ye and you system it that's

just a fascinating sort of

philosophically at every level question

and the methodology to try to answer

that question what does it mean to be

alive yeah so that that that's a huge

endeavor and it's nice that there's at

least some from some perspective a clean

answer so maybe can you talk about that

optimization view of it so what what's

trying to be minimized to maximize what

a system that's alive what is it trying

to minimize right you've you've made a

big move yes to make big moves but

you've assumed that the things the thing

exists before the in a state that could

be living on nonliving so I may ask you

or what licenses you to say that

something exists that's why I use the

word existential it's beyond living it's

just existence so if you drill down onto

the definition of things that exist then

they have certain properties if you

borrow the maths from non-equilibrium

steady state physics that enable you to

interpret their existence in terms of

this optimization procedure so it's good

you introduce the word optimization so

what the free-energy principle in its

sort of most ambitious but also most

deflationary and simplest says is if

something exists then it must by the

mathematics of non-equilibrium steady

state exhibit properties that may

look as if it is optimizing a particular

quantity and it turns out that

particular quantity happens to be

exactly the same as the evidence lower

bound in machine learning or Bayesian

model evidence in Bayesian statistics or

and then I can list a whole other you

know list of ways of understanding this

this this key quantity which is a bound

on on surprisal self information if you

know information theory there are whole

there are a number of different

perspectives on this contry it's this

basically the log of probability of

being in a particular state I'm telling

this story as an honest and attempt to

answer your question and I'm answering

it as if I was pretending to be a

physicist who was trying to understand

the fundaments of non-equilibrium steady

state and I shouldn't really be doing

that because the last time I was taught

physics I was in my twenties what kind

of systems when you think about the free

energy principle what kind of systems

are you imagining it's a sort of more

specific kind of case study you know I'm

imagining a range of systems but you're

at its simplest

a sim a single-celled organism that can

be identified from its eco nation or its

environment so at its simplest that

that's basically what what I always

imagined in my head and you may ask well

is there anything how on earth can you

even in elaborate questions about the

existence of a acing a single drop of

oil for example yeah

what but there aren't D questions there

why doesn't the oil why doesn't the

thing the interface between the drop of

oil that contains an interior and the

thing that is not the drop of oil which

is the solvent in which it is immersed

how does that interface persist over

time why doesn't the oldest dissolve

into solvent

so what special properties of the

exchange between the surface of the oil

drop and the external states in which

it's immersed if you're physicists say

would be the heat bath you know you've

got a you've got a physical system an

ensemble again with about ten stomachs

ensemble dynamics an ensemble of ik of

atoms or molecules immersed in the heat

path but the question is how did the

heat bath get there and why is it not

dissolved why was it maintaining itself

exactly what actions is it I mean it's

such a fascinating idea of a drop of oil

and I guess it would dissolve in water

wouldn't dissolve in water so what

precisely so why not so why not why not

and how do you mathematically describe

me is such a beautiful idea and also the

idea of like where does the thing where

does the drop of oil and yeah and where

does it begin right so I mean you're

asking the questions deep in in a normal

area but what you can do you see so this

is a deflationary part of it

can I just qualify mouths so by saying

that normally when I'm asked this

question I answer from the point of view

of a psychologist we talk about

predictive processing and pretty coding

and you know the brain is an inference

machine but you haven't asked me from

that perspective I'm answering from the

point of view of a physicist so you you

know the question is not so much why but

if it exists what properties must it

display so that's the deflation in part

the 300 prints we print the 300

principal does not supply and answer as

to why it's saying if something exists

then he must display these properties

that's that's the other sort of the

thing that's on offer and it so happens

that these properties a must display are

actually intriguing and have this

inferential gloss this there's this sort

of self evidencing loss that inherits

from the fact that the very preservation

of the boundary between the oil drop and

the not oil drop requires an optimized

of a particular function or a functional

that's that defines the presence of the

existence of of this order which is why

I started with existential imperatives

and the it ISM it is a necessary

condition for existence that this must

occur because the thing the boundary

basically defines the things that's

existing so it is that self-assembly

aspect it's that for the you hinting at

in biology sometimes known as Auto

poiesis in computational chemistry Mis

self-assembly it's the what what does it

look like sorry how would you describe

things that configure themselves out of

nothing the where they clearly demarcate

themselves from the states on the soup

in which they are immersed so from the

point of view of computational chemistry

for example you just understand that as

a configuration of a macromolecule to

minimize its free energy is

thermodynamic free energy it's exactly

the same principle that we've been

talking about that thermodynamic free

energy is just the negative elbow it's

the same mathematical calm construct so

the very emergence of existence of

structure or form that can be

distinguished from the environment or

the thing that is not the thing

necessitates the you know the existence

of an objective function then it looks

as if it is minimizing it's finally a

free energy minima and so just to

clarify I'm trying to wrap my head

around so the the free energy principle

says that if something exists these are

the properties it should display yes so

what what that means is we can't just

look we can't just go into a soup and

there's no mechanism if free energy

principle doesn't give us a mechanism to

find the things that exist is that what

it was implying is being applied that

you can kind of use it to reason to

think about like study a particular

system and say

does this exhibit these qualities that's

an excellent question to answer that

after I have to return to your previous

question but what's the difference

between living and nonliving things

actually Society so yeah that maybe we

can go there you kind of drew a line and

and forgive me for the stupid questions

but the you kind of draw a line between

living and existing yeah is there an

interesting sort of distinction

distinction

yeah I think there is so you know things

do exist grains of sand rocks on the

moon trees you so all of these things

can be separated from the environment in

which they are immersed and therefore

there must at some level be optimizing

their free energy taking this sort of

model evidence interpretation of this

quantity that basically means their self

evidencing another nice little twist of

phrase here is that you are your own

existence proof you know statistically

speaking which I don't think I said that

somebody did but I love that phrase you

are your own existence proof yeah

so it's ur existential isn't it I'm

gonna have to think about there for a

few days

yeah the view there's a beautiful line

so the the step through to answer your

question about you know what's it good

for big girl on the following lines

first of all you have to define what it

means to exist which down as you rightly

pointed out you have to define what

probabilistic properties must the states

of something possess so that it has so

it knows where it finishes and then you

write out that down in terms of

statistical independence is again

sparsity again it's not what's connected

or what score elated or what depends

upon what it's what's not correlated and

what doesn't depend upon something again

it comes down to the the deeper

structures not in this is hierarchal

but the suddenly the the structures that

emerge from removing connectivity in

dependency in this instance basically

being able to identify the surface of

the oil drop from the water in which it

is immersed and when you do that you

start to realize well there are actually

four sub kinds of states in any given

universe that contains anything the

things that are internal to the surface

the things that are external to the

surface and the surface in and of itself

which is why I use a metaphor a little

single-celled organism that has an

interior and exterior and then the the

surface of the cell and that's

mathematically a Markov blanket just to

pause I'm in awe of this concept that

there's the stuff outside the surface

stuff inside the surface in the surface

itself the Markov blanket it's just the

most beautiful kind of notion about

trying to explore what it means to exist

you're automatically I apologize this is

a beautiful idea but came out of

California so that's I changed my mind I

take it all so sorry anyway so what you

were just talking about the surface

about the market yeah so this surface or

this blanket these blanket states that

are this you know the because they are

now defined in relation to these

Independence's and your Walker what

different states internal or blanket or

external states can which ones can

influence each other and which cannot

influence each other you can now apply

standard results that you would find in

non equilibrium physics or steady state

or thermodynamics or hydrodynamics

usually out of equilibrium solutions and

apply them to this partition and what it

looks like as if all the Norman normal

gradient flows that you would associate

with any non equilibrium system

apply in such a way that to part of the

Markov blanket and the internal states

seem to be hill climbing or doing a

gradient descent on the same quantity

and that means that you can now describe

the very existence of this oil drop you

can write down the existence of this

holdup in terms of flows dynamics

equations of motion where the blanket

States or part of them we call them

active States and the internal states

now seem to be and must be trying to

look as if they're minimizing the same

function which is a lot of probability

of occupying this but these states the

interesting thing is that what would

they be called if you were trying to

describe these things there were what

we're talking about are internal states

external states and blanket States

now let's carve the blanket States into

to sensory states and active States

operationally it has to be the case that

in order for this carving up in two

different sets of states to exist the

active States the Markov blanket cannot

be influenced by the external states and

we already know that the internal States

can't be influenced by the external

States cousin the blanket separates them

so what does that mean well it means the

active States the internal states are

now jointly not influenced by external

states they only have autonomous

dynamics so now you've got a picture of

an oil drop that has autonomy

it has autonomous States it has

autonomous days in the sense that there

must be some parts of the surface of the

oil drop that are not influenced by the

external states and all the Interior and

together those two states endow even a

little oil drop with autonomous states

that look as if they are optimizing

their variational free energy or their

negative elbow their model evidence

and that would be an interesting

intellectual exercise and you could say

you can even go into the realms of pants

psychism that everything that exists is

implicitly making inferences on self

evidencing now we made the next move but

what about living things I mean so let

me ask you what's the difference between

an oil drop and a little tadpole or a

little lava or plankton the picture

which is painted of an oil drop just

immediately in a matter of minutes took

me into the world of pants is where you

you just convinced me what made me feel

like an oil drop is a living certainly

an autonomous system but almost the

living system so as a capability sensory

capabilities and acting capabilities and

it maintains something so what is the

difference between that and something

that we traditionally think of as a

living system that it could die or you

can't I mean a yab mortality I'm not I'm

not exactly sure I'm not sure what the

right answer there is because they can

move them like movement seems like an

essential elements to being able to act

in the environment but the oil drop is

doing that so I don't know easy the mall

drop will be moved but does it inner of

itself move autonomously well it or the

surface is performing actions that

maintain its structure yeah you're being

too clever I was out of service

certified a passive little oil drop this

is sitting there yeah and the bottom on

the top of a glass sure I guess what I'm

trying to say is you're absolutely right

you hear you've even nailed it its

movement yeah so where does that

movement come from if it comes from the

inside then then you've got I think

something that's living what do you mean

from the inside what I mean is that the

internal States the can influence

reactive states that where the actor

states can influence but they're not

influenced by the external states can

cause movement so

there are two types of oil drops if you

like there are oil drops where the

internal states are so random that they

average themselves away and the thing

cannot on a balance on average when you

do the averaging move so a nice example

of that will be the Sun the Sun Sony has

internal States and lots of intrinsic

autonomous activity going on but because

it's not corded because it doesn't have

the deep in the Millennial sense a

hierarchical structure and the brain

does there is no overall mode or pattern

or organization that expresses itself on

the surface that allows it to actually

swim it it can certainly have you're a

very active surface but on mass at the

scale of the actual surface of the Sun

the average position of that surface

cannot in itself move because the

internal dynamics are more like a hot

gas they are literally like a hot gas

whereas your internal dynamics are much

more structured and deeply structured

and now you can express on your mark of

in your active States with your muscles

and and your secretary organs your

autonomic nervous system and its

effectors you can actually move and

that's all you can do and that's

something which you know if you haven't

thought of it like this before

I think it's nice just realize there is

no other way that you can change the

universe other than simply moving

whether that moving is articulating my

with my voice box or walking around or

squeezing juices out of my secreting

organs there's only one way you can

change the universe it's moving and in

the fact that you do so non randomly it

makes you alive yeah so it's not

non-randomness so that the that's what

sohe's and that would be manifesting we

realize in terms of essentially swimming

essentially moving changing one shape a

morphogenesis

that is dynamic and possibly adaptive so

that that's what I was trying to get out

between the difference from the oil drop

and the little tadpole

the the tampo is moving around its his

active states are actually changing the

external states and there's now a cycle

an action perception cycle if you like a

recurrent dynamic that's going on that

depends upon this deeply structured

autonomous behavior the rests upon

internal dynamics that are not only

modeling they data impressed upon their

surface or the blanket States but they

are actively resampling those data by

moving they're moving towards Kemet say

chemical gradients in chemotaxis

so they've gone beyond just being good

little models of the kind of world they

live in for example an oil droplet could

in a pan psychic sense be construed as a

little being that has now perfectly

inferred it's a passive nonliving

oil-drop living in a bowl of water no

problem no but to now equipped that oil

drop with the ability to go out and test

that hypothesis about different states

and beings so we can actually push its

surface over there over there and test

for chemical gradients or then you start

to move to much more lifelike form now

this cells is on fun theoretically

interesting but it it actually is quite

important in terms of reflecting what I

have seen since the turn of the

millennium which is this move towards it

and they inactive an embodied

understanding of intelligence and you

say you're from machine learning yes so

what that means this this sort of the

central importance of movement

I think has yet to really hit machine

learning

it certainly has now diffused itself

throughout robotics

and perhaps you can say certain problems

in active vision where you actually have

to move the camera to sample this and

that but machine learning of the data

mining deep learning saw simply hasn't

contended with this issue what is done

instead of dealing with the movement

problem and the active sampling of data

it is said we don't need to worry about

we can see all the data because we've

got big data so we need nor movement so

that for me is you know an important

omission in current machine learned and

current machine learning is much more

like the oil drop yes

but an oil drop that enjoys exposure to

nearly all the data you see to be first

as opposed to the tadpoles swimming out

to find the right data for example it

likes food that's a good hypothesis test

analyst go and move and ingest food for

example and see what that you know is

that evidence that I'm the kind of thing

that likes this kind of food so the the

next natural question and forgive this

question but if we think of sort of even

artificial intelligence systems we just

paint a beautiful picture of existence

and life so do you do you ascribe would

you do you find within this framework a

possibility of defining consciousness or

exploring the idea of consciousness like

what you know self-awareness and expand

it to consciousness thing yeah how can

we how can we start to think about

consciousness within this framework is

it possible yeah I think it's possible

to think about it whether you'll get

again I'm not sure that I'm licensed to

like question you I think you'd have to

speak to a qualified philosopher to get

a definitive answer that but certainly

there's a lot of interest in using not

just these ideas but related ideas from

information theory to try and tie down

the the maths and the calculus and the

geometry of consciousness either in

terms of sort of a minimal consciousness

III even less than a minimal selfhood

and what I'm talking about is the

ability effectively to plan so have

agency so you could argue that a virus

does have a form of agency in virtue of

the way that it selectively finds hosts

and cells to live in and moves around

but you wouldn't endow it with the

capacity to think about planning and

moving in a purposeful way where it

countenances the future whereas you

might announce you might think an ants

not quite as unconscious as a virus it

certainly seems to have a purpose it

talks to its friends on route during its

foraging it has a different kind of

autonomy which is biotic but beyond a

virus so there's something about so

there's some line that has to do with

the complexity of planning yes that may

contain an answer I mean it'd be

beautiful if if we can find a line

beyond which you could say look being as

cautious yes it would be these are

wonderful lines that we've drawn with

existence life and consciousness yes it

will be very nice what one little

wrinkle there and this is something I've

only learned in the past few months is

the notion the philosophical notion of

vagueness so you're saying it would be

wonderful to draw a line and I had

always assumed that that line at some

point would be drawn and

until about four months ago and the

philosopher told me about vagueness so I

know if you've come across this but it's

a technical concept and I think most

revealingly illustrated with at what

point does a pile of sand become a pile

is it one grain two grains three grains

or four grains so at what point would

you draw the line between being a pile

of sand and a collection of some of the

grains of sand in the same way is it

right to ask where would I draw the line

between conscious and unconscious and it

might be a vague concept having said

that I agree with you entirely I know

systems that have the ability to plan so

just technically what that means is your

your inferential self evidencing by

which I simply mean the dynamics

literally the thermodynamics and

gradient flows that underwrite the

preservation of your oil droplet like

form are described as a canvas who has

an optimization of Molag Bayesian model

evidence in your elbow that self

evidencing must be evidence for a model

of what's causing the sensory

impressions on the sensory part of your

surface or your Markov blanket if that

model is capable of planning it must

include a model of the future

consequences who your active States or

your action just panning so we're now in

the game of planning as inference now

notice what we've made though we've made

quite a big move away from big data and

machine learning because again it's the

consequences of moving it's a

consequence of selecting those data or

those data or looking over there and

like that tells you immediately that

even to be a contender for a conscious

artifact or you know a as it's strong AI

or generalize a little no

then you've got to have movement in the

game and furthermore you've got to have

a genitive model of the sort you might

find in say a variation or two encoder

that is thinking about the future

conditioned upon different courses of

action now that brings a number of

things to the table which which now is

start think more those who've got all

the right ingredients talk about

consciousness I've now got to select an

among a number of different courses of

action into the future as part of

planning I've now got free will the act

of selecting this course of action or

that policy or that policy or that

action suddenly makes me into an

inference machine of self evidencing

artifact that now looks as if it's

selecting amongst different alternative

ways forward as I actively swim here or

swim there all yes look over here look

over there so I think you've now got to

a situation if there is planning in the

mix you're now getting much closer to

that line if that line whatever to exist

I don't think it gets you quite as far

as self aware though I think you and

then your you have to I think grapple

with the question how would formally

write down a calculus or a maths of

self-awareness I don't think it's

impossible to do but I think you would

know we pressure on you to actually

commit to a formal definition or a mean

by self awareness I think most people

that I know would probably say that a

goldfish no pet fish was not self-aware

they would probably argue about their

favourite cat

but would be quite happy to say that

that mom was self-aware so I mean but

that might very well connect to some

level of complexity with planning it

seems like self-awareness is essential

for complex planning yeah do you want to

talk about further coffee you're

absolutely right again the line is

unclear but it seems like integrating

yourself into the world into Europe into

your planning is essential for

constructing complex plans yes yeah

so I'm mathematically describing that in

the same elegant way as you have the

free energy principle might be difficult

well yes and no I don't think that well

perhaps we should just can we just go

back that's a very important answer you

gave like I think if I just unpacked it

you know you'd see the truisms or you've

just you've just exposed France but

maybe so yeah I I'm mindful that I

didn't answer your question before well

yeah what's the pre hundred principle

good for is it just a pretty theoretical

exercise to explain non-equilibrium

steady stays yes it is it does nothing

more for you than that it can be

regarded as our arrogance but you know

it is of the sort of theory of natural

selection or a hypothesis of natural

selection

beautiful undeniably true but tells you

absolutely nothing else yeah y-you have

legs and eyes and you know it tells you

nothing about the actual phenotyping and

it wouldn't allow you to build something

so the free press or directly the thigh

itself is is as vacuous as most

tautological theories and by

tautological of course I'm talking to

that you know the theory of Naturals the

survival of the fittest and once the

fittest isn't survival while this why

cuz the fitter in disc around in circles

is in a sense the free energy principle

has that same you know deflationary

tautology I'm you're under the hood it's

yeah it's two ago it's a characteristic

of things that exist why they exist

because they minimize their energy while

the minified know as a free energy

because they exist and use keep on going

round and round

but the what the practical thing which

you don't get from natural selection but

you could say has now manifest in things

like differential evolution or genetic

algorithms or NCM see for example in

machine learning the practical thing you

can get is if it looks as if things that

exist are trying to have density

dynamics and look as though they're

optimizing a variational free energy and

a variational free energy has to be a

functional or a gerund to model a

probabilistic description of causes and

consequences causes out there

consequences in the sensorial on the

sensory parts of the Markov blanket then

it should in theory possible to write

down the genitive model work out the

gradients and then cause it to

autonomously self-evidence so you should

be able to write down oil droplets you

should be able to create artifacts where

you have supplied the objective function

their supplies the gradients and

supplies the self-organizing dynamics to

non-equilibrium steady state so there is

actually a practical application the

free energy principle when you can write

down your required evidence in terms of

well when you can ride down the

Geraldton model that is the thing that

has the evidence the probability of

these sensory data on this data given

that given that model is effectively the

thing that the elbow of the variational

free energy bounds little proximate s'

that means that you can actually write

down the model and the kind of thing

that you want to engineer the kind of

AGI odd artificial general intelligence

that you want to manifest

probabilistically and then you engineer

or world work where you would engineer a

robot and a computer to perform a

gradient descent on that objective

function so it does have a practical

implication now why am i Wittering on

about that it did seem relevant to yes

so what kinds of J so the answer to the

but it would it be easier and be hard

well mathematically is easy I've just

told you all you

right down your your perfect artifact

probabilistically in the form of a

promising charity model probability

distribution over the causes and

consequences of the world in which this

thing is immersed and then you just

engineer a computer and a robot to

perform a gradient descent on that

objective function no problem but of

course the big problem is writing down

the generative model so that's where the

heavy lifting comes in yeah so it's it's

the form and the structure of that

journal team model which basically

defines the artifact that you will

create or indeed the kind of artifact

that has self-awareness so that's where

all the hard work comes very much like

natural selection doesn't tell you in

the slightest why you have eyes so you

have to drill down on the actual feeding

time the actual giant ear model so with

that in mind what did you tell me that

tells me immediately the kinds of

journey models I would have to write

down in order to have self-awareness

what you said to me was I have to have a

model that is effectively fit for

purpose for this kind of world in which

I operate and if I now make the

observation that this kind of world is

effectively largely populated by other

things like me ie you then it makes

enormous sense that if I can develop a

hypothesis that we are similar kinds of

creatures this is in fact the same kind

of creature

but I am me and you are you then it

becomes again mandated to have a sense

of self so if I live in a world that is

constituted by things like me basically

a social world a community then it

becomes necessary now for me to him

further it's me talking and not you

talking I wouldn't need that if is on

Mars by myself or if I was in the jungle

as a feral child if there was nothing

like it if there's nothing like me

around there would be no need to have a

an inference that our hypotheses are yes

it is me that is experiencing or causing

these sounds and it is not you it's only

when there's ambiguity and play induced

by the fact that there are others in

that world so I think then the special

thing about self-aware artifacts is that

they have learned to or they have

acquired or at least are equipped with

possibly by evolution Jarett of models

that allow for the fad there are lots of

copies of things like them around and

therefore they have to work out it's you

and not me that that's brilliant and

I've never thought of that I never

thought of that that the purpose of the

the really usefulness of consciousness

or self-awareness in the context of

planning existing in the world is so you

can operate with other things like you

and like you couldn't it doesn't have to

necessarily be human it could be other

kind of similar creatures and some

absolutely we would view a lot of our

attributes into our pets don't waste

them or we try to make our robots

humanoid and I think there's a your deep

reason for that but it's this much

easier to read the world if you can make

the simplifying assumption that

basically you're me and it's just your

turn to talk and I mean when we talk

about planning when you talk

specifically about planning the

highest.if manifestation or realization

of that planning is what we're doing now

I mean the human condition doesn't get

any higher than this talking about the

philosophy of existence and the

conversation but in that conversation

there is a a you know a beautiful art of

turn-taking

and it neutral inference theory of mind

I have to know when you want to listen I

have to know when you want to interrupt

an to make sure that you're on line

I have to have a model in my head of

your model in your head that's the

highest the most sophisticated form of

generative model where the genitive

model actually has a gentle model

somebody else's journeyer model and I

think that and what we are doing now

evinces the kinds of Geritol models that

would support self-awareness because

without that we both be talking over

each other or we'd be singing together

in a in a choir you know we're

which is probably not that's not a

bridge analogy what I'm trying to say

yeah we wouldn't have this discourse

yeah what dance of it yeah that's right

Dallas to have as I interrupt I mean

that's beautifully put

I'll really listen to this conversation

many times uh there's so much poetry in

this and mathematics let me ask the

silliest or perhaps the biggest question

as the last kind of question we've

Meaning of life
talked about living in existence and an

objective function under which these

objects would operate what do you think

is the objective function of our

existence what's the meaning of life

what do you think is the for you perhaps

the purpose the source of fulfillment

the source of meaning for your existence

as one blob in this soup I'm tempted to

answer that as a physicist and free

energy I expect consequent upon my

behavior so technically that we are and

we get a really interesting conversation

about what that comprises in terms of

searching for information resolving

uncertainty about the kind of thing that

I am but a suspect that you you you you

you want a slightly more personal and

financier and but which is can be

consistent with that and I think it's

reassuring is simple and harps back to

what you were taught as a child that you

have certain beliefs about the kind of

creature and the kind of person you are

and all that self evidencing means all

that minimizing variational free-energy

in an in an inactive and embodied way

means is fulfilling the beliefs about

what kind of thing you are and of course

we're all given those scripts those

narratives very early as usual in the

form of bedtime stories or fairy stories

I'm a princess I gotta meet a beast

who's gonna transform ya a prince and

the narratives are all around you from

your parents to thee to the friends to

the society feeds these stories and then

then your objective function is to

fulfill exactly

now the narrative that has been in

cultured by your your immediate family

but as you say also the sort of the

culture in which you've made you grow

and you create for yourself I mean a

game because of this active inference

it's an inactive aspect of self

evidencing you know not only am i

modeling my environment my ecognition my

my external states out there but I'm

actively changing them all the time and

it still isn't doing the same back we're

doing it together so there's a a

synchrony that means that I'm creating

my own culture over different time

scales so the question now is for me

being very selfish what scripts were I

given it basically was a mixture between

an Einstein and shark Holmes so I smoked

as heavily as possible try to avoid too

much interpersonal contact yet enjoy the

fantasy that the the you know you're a

popular scientist who's gonna make a

difference and it's like a quirky way so

that's what's where I grew up on my

father my father was an engineer and

love science and enough he loved real

sort of things like Sir Arthur and his

space-time and gravitation which was the

the other the first understandable

version of general relativity and he so

although all the fairy stories I was

told as I was growing up were all about

these characters keeping the Hobbit out

of this because I was quite nervous

there's a journey of exploration I

suppose it's not so yeah I've just grown

up to being what I imagine a

mild-mannered Sherlock Holmes slush

Alvin star would would do it in my shoes

and you did it elegantly and beautifully
