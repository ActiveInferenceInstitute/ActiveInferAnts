excellent and we're away okay so welcome everybody to the first episode of active
inference insights brought to you by the active inference Institute I am your
host darus parvey Wayne and today I have the privilege of speaking to Professor Carl friston one of the most
revolutionary thinkers in the fields of Neuroscience cognitive science theoretical biology and dare I say
physics and philosophy a leading Authority in neuroimaging he is the
inventor of statistical parametric modeling and voxal based morry I hope I pronounce that correctly more recently
he has posited the free energy principle which is technically a normative account of self-organization in terms of optimal
Basi and design or in other words a description of how things continue to be
things as such his groundbreaking ideas hold profound implications not only for biology and psychology but also the the
very nature of reality itself ladies and gentlemen it is my honor to introduce
Professor K friston Professor friston thank you so much for joining us well thank you thank you for that lovely
introduction what you can say is I I just invented lots of three-letter acronyms that's much
simpler so you have and I sense a lot of freeletter acronyms have also spawned
from from a lot of your work um excellent well this podcast this
is the first episode so as I was saying sort of off camera this is very exciting for me hopefully very exciting for everyone tuning in the kind of uh the
reason why it's come about is that we wanted the active inference Institute wanted a way to introduce the ideas of active inference and the free energy
principle perhaps to an audience who were not PhD holders scholars in the area but had a kind of latent interest
in Psychology Neuroscience maths biology whatever it is and wanted to explore these ideas a little bit fter a little
bit further so it's a non specialized introduction to the ideas of active inference and the free energy principle
and as the author inventor discoverer of the free energy principle we can have an
interesting philosophical conversation about what that is um it's it's an absolute Delight to have you so I guess
my first question that I need to ask for everyone listening is could you give us a very brief or not very brief but a
very um accessible definition of the free energy principle um what free energy is and how
you know what this what this principle says about reality and
ourselves yes I'm not very good at giving brief answers but do my we have
we have a while so so go ahead um so just to put things in
context um the free energy principle is a principle um as read by a physicist or
engineer that means it's a method um much like Hamilton's principle of least
action that you can apply um so one might ask what are the S the most
important applications of the free energy principle I guess that would be active inference so I will answer your
question and I will say what the free energy principle is but um that may have to be qualified by looking specifically
at the application which is active inflence and what that means um theologically her istically you know
what it brings to the table when you do apply the free energy principle but the free energy principle itself um is just
a description of things that persist or exist and it rests upon a careful
specification of what you mean by a thing um it starts with the exactly the
same assumptions that all of physics starts with basically a random dynamical
system some people describe that in terms of um stochastic differential equations for if you're not familiar
with that kind of description is just saying that you can describe the universe in terms of the way that states
change as a function of themselves so it's a very generic um description of
Any Given universe that just commits to the notion that there is a state of the universe and it could be very high
dimensional and that it has some Dynamics so that's where the free energy principle starts but the special thing
about the free energy principle um that distinguishes it from other um
formulations in physics for example Quantum thermodynamics um statistical
and classical mechanics all of which can be if you like derived from this basic
description of the world as a random dynamical system the thing that um
separates the free energy principle uh or gives it its particular flavor is a
careful distinction between the states of something and everything else uh and
the way that we do that is by inducing a separation you know uh technically a
partition of all possible States into three kinds the states of something that
are internal to the thing everything else external to the thing and then crucially a set of states that separate
seate the uh internal from the external states that allow and couple the inside
to the outside and that's referred to as a um the blanket States or a Markoff blanket or boundary um so a lot of this
rests upon this this notion of a boundary that um on the one hand
separates the inside from the outside of something and by a thing I mean anything from a small particle to a to a priest
or a person anything that can can be individuated and uh possesses
characteristic States constitutes something um and with tongue and cheek
you therefore have a theory of every space thing not everything but every
thing um so this Mark of boundary or Mark of
blanket um um is a sort of crucial device um in the sense that it allows
you to individuate something from everything else but at the same time it
um couples the internal to the external States so we're now talking about a
special kind of physics and probably a more ubiquitous kind of physics which is the physics of open systems um because
the inside is now vicariously open to in exchange with the outside across the
Markoff blanket and just um for interest because this will be relevant later on for active inference we usually divide
the uh blanket States into active and sensory states that can be regarded very
simply as of the inputs and the outputs um uh technically the um the inputs of
the sensory states are defined in um in the sense that the in internal states
don't influence the sensory States and conversely the active states are defined
such that the external states don't influence the the active States so but
more simply what we're saying is that something can be defined in terms of the influences upon it and the influences
that it exerts through the blanket states on the outside world so just
given that assumption um that entails um existence in the sense that
to Define this Markoff blanket you have to um you need for the system to have
some characteristic States technically an attracting set of states that you'd find the thing in just by assuming the
existence of this attracting set of this random dynamical system that possesses
this distinction between the inside and the outside everything else follows and everything else simply put is you can
read the internal and active States sometimes refer to as the autonomous
states of a particle or a priest or a person um as
um either if you're a phys IST conforming to a particular principle of
least action and that principle of least action is that um it minimizes the path
integral of the variation of free energy um if you want to think of this more intuitively because that free energy
also stands in for or is an approximation to a bound upon model
evidence you can also say that it must be the case that the autonomous states
of anything will look as if they are trying to maximize the evidence for what we would
now um consider the internal states to
be um a model of what's going on on the
outside so um some people refer to that as self- evidencing um so if I just
repeat that from the physicist point of view given the the assumption that
you've got this random dynamical system with an attracting set that can that has
this partition that allows you to individuate something within this system it has to be the case that the Dynamics
of the autonomous states of that system um perform a gradient flow on a quantity
called variation free energy that's it is that interesting well it becomes interesting if you
realize that this variation free energy has a particular meaning and a you um a
particular interpretation that gives you a teleology for this kind of dynamic uh
and that Tey is often referred to in terms of basy mechanics why well because
the um the free energy the variational free energy is the same quantity that
measures the evidence for a generative model of the causes of some data if
you're a statistician and in this instance the data that we're talking about are the impressions of the outside State on the
on the Markoff blanket so um what you're now in a position or you now in a
position you are now licensed to talk about anything that exists in some
simple Elemental sense uh performing inference and possessing this or
evincing this kind of basing mechanics um and in philosophy um people like
yakob har nice summarizes as self- evidencing so you can imagine that it looks as if anything that exists is
basically moving in a way uh sensing and acting upon its World in a way that's
Garing um evidence for its own existence so it's this is you know if you like a
slight cheat in the sense that you what we're doing is describing the Dynamics
of something that exists and then we're saying ah but it now looks as if
it in in in virtue of its existence it is now it can be described theologically
as acting to gather evidence for its own existence its own um um its own
structure and that structure entails a generative model of what's going on on the outside so how does that help
well it doesn't really help in any fundamental way other than it's very pretty and it it's it's nice to talk
about basy mechanics as being a sort of complement uh or another kind of physics
that comes from the same stable as quantum mechanics and cystic mechanics and I repeat classical or lran mechanics
um however there is a nice um application at hand once you realize
that this uh once you interpret um the variation free energy in terms of a um
technically the logarithm of some model evidence what that means is that you can
now build things you can build things and you can simulate those things why
well because you know that their Dynamics must be um conforming to this
principle of least action um uh another way of thinking about this is that it um
does a gradi in descent or hill climbing on a particular um functional which is
um this um variation free energy or the negative variation free energy which is the log evidence so um because this log
evidence uh is a function of a model that just is a description of the
characteristic States things occupy or things are found in um you can now write
down the generative model which is just a probability distribution over the
characteristic States or defining the characteristic States you want your thing to be attracted to this is the
attracting set and once you've written down your generative model you can then work out the gradients um of the free
energy functional of that generative model and then you can simply um
integrate or mathematically solve for the Dynamics the flow the motion the movement of this thing so I know this
isn't terribly accessible but it's it's uh uh a way I think of these things that
you are uh now in a position instead of just looking at something and saying oh I
wonder what uh generative model um would be fit for purpose to describe this particular thing you can now turn that
on its head and say okay I want this kind of thing and I'm going to describe and Define this kind of thing with a
particular gened model I just have to write down the probability distribution um over the causes and consequences from
the point of view of the thing in question namely the external States and its Impressions upon um the Markoff
blanket and once I've written that down I can now simulate the autonomous States
I can now create a little autonomous artifact a little autonomous particle that behaves in exactly the same way as
something that existed that had that kind of generative model so it's a very practical if you like um uh it's a
principle that can be applied in a very practical way to simulate things and if you can then simulate at things you can
start to build things you can start to um
um do computational Neuroscience you can start to sort of naturalize cognitive um
neuroscience and possibly even sort of um psychology in terms of the physics
that is inherent in this basing mechanics that comes from the free energy principle um you can also start
to ask questions about the beliefs of another person why well part of this
generative model or um the generative model can always be sort of um split into two things sort of
priors before you see some data and the likelihood the likelihood of that data
given um the causes of that data these will be the external States so you have
pry belief over the causes the external States and you have a likelihood that Maps the causes to the consequences
which are your observations so your Sensations um and therefore you can now
fiddle with and say um a synthetic subject or person who is being simulated
in the computer until their behavior their actions possibly their decisions
matches that of Any Given um cohort or any given um um subject or animal um and
then having adjusted the prior part of the generative model and possibly the likelihood you've now basically created
a digital twin that emulates the same kind of belief updating the same kind of basing
mechanics um that you can now infer as possessed by the thing in question so
this is a um sort of quite a high-end application which which is um you know one of the the um the motivations for um
de for developing the free energy principle and and active influences an application um that it enables you to
essentially phenotype another thing another person for example in terms of
this belief updating in terms of this basing mechanics um and that can be quite useful in context when you want to
understand how people work and particularly how their belief updating works this becomes particularly
interesting in the context of computational Psychiatry where you want to be able to
explain people's behavior in terms of what do they Bel about the world out
there you know how how um how are they sense making how are they assimilating
evidence for their world model which you can read as the generative model U and under what priors are they doing doing
this sort of basian um assimilation or evidence accumulation um the underwrites
their decisions so that's one um um one particular application there be other
applications um you know if you want to make intelligent artifacts or you want to understand the mechanisms of belief
updating at different temporal scales um belief sharing between two things that
are in communication or transacting across the a shared markof blanket or
indeed uh looking at a shared World um and then one can start to get into the
world of um distributed cognition and Federated inference there are all sorts of things you can do once you start to
apply active inference yeah that was that was
fantastic I mean we have a lot to get our get our teeth into um and and probably some Concepts there that are
new to a to to our audience so it might be worth sort of backtracking certain things and and and trying
to um find a kind of yeah a let's sort of dissect some of these
Concepts together um the first thing I want to speak about is this notion that
the internal States in some sense embody um the kind of desirable model
given their attractor State the desirable model of the world I think um one of these one of the questions that
one has when one enters into the world of active inference is whether an organism is a model or whether an
organism has model and here we sort of have a a backtrack to cybernetics and
the good regulator theorem that all good um regulatory systems have a model of
their environment if we think about thermostats or um anything alike so
maybe it's worth un unpacking that because I think a lot of people might have this intuitive sense that there's a
homunculus in the brain which has a model of the world and it's very internalist but maybe from a more
physics perspective we can adopt a more externalist position position where there isn't this little thing which has
a sort of Representative picture of the world but actually is just
enacting um some model of itself which in many ways is just some it some
version of the of its external Dynamics um so let's start there because I think
that will feed nicely into maybe a conversation about internal and external Dynamics and exactly what that looks like in the free energy
principle yeah that that's a great question and uh you some sort of deep issues Unearthed by that and it's nice
you've introduced cybernetics and notion of the good regulator theorem because you know in one on one view I think you
could look at um the free energy Principle as just a 21st century version of that kind of cytic thinking there are
other there are other things that the free energy principal inherits uh from um you know James's Max men principle
lots of ideas in in in Psychology perceptions hypothesis testing there are lots of different um roads that converge
upon this um um formulation um that that
is uner in terms of the free energy principle um but that particular question is is really interesting uh I
have to say that I usually um try to elude that question by saying that the
the internal States entail a generative model so um however I um if I had if one
was pressed upon it um then um I would say very clearly uh that the
internal States um the thing is a generative model it's not if you like um
a picture that you painted in terms of that hunus looking at its sort of you know its virtual reality inside its head
and trying to what's going on it is instantiated it is realized in its physics in its existence in its Dynamics
um the reason I use the word entailed is that the generative model um is um
technically uh just a probability distribution um so you you ask yourself
well does a probability distribution exist um in some physical sense um and
the answer is well no um a probability distribution is what it is it's a a mathematical description um however that
um probability distribution will have sufficient statistics that could exist
so what I'm saying is that um for example let's take a ging distribution
um you know I can I can um Express mathematically I can write down the notation for your ging a bell-shaped
distribution over some variable that goes from plus to minus infinity um or I
can say I can characterize or specify this ging
distribution in terms of its mean and its variance and and those are two numbers that are not random variables
they are sufficient statistics and it may be and in fact it is the case that
that the um the free energy principle Associates the the physical internal
states with the sufficient statistics of these basian beliefs and there's a lovely story you know in mathematics um
that would take you down the path of information geometries and cisal manifolds and um belief updatings as
movements in these geometries and you know try to down the the metrics in these spaces and how that relates to
uncertainty and precision all all that's a lovely story um we don't need to
really pursue that at the moment the key point being made here that the generative model um is not physically
instantiated other than in terms of some uh sufficient statistics in any setting
um however in the in the free energy principle the generative model is in of
itself never actually instantiated in terms or realized in terms of um its um
statist sufficient statistics and that's because of something that we were talking about before which is the Dynamics so the Dynamics is a gradient
flow um which means that all we need are the gradients of the free energy so we
don't need the generative model all we need is the gradients of this free energy function or F technically a
function or a function of a function of the generative model so if I was building an artifact I could
certainly prescribe the right Dynamics by writing down a generative model and then I could evaluate the gradients of
that um of that um free energy function of the generative model and then those
gradients would actually drive the Dynamics I could simulate self-organization I could simulate active inference I could simulate belief
sharing whatever I wanted to do um but in that simulation all I really
needed were the gradients of the free energy uh and we only need the generative model because the um the free
energy is a function of the generative model so in that sense the generative
model is really a t logical description that you would bring to the table to
understand your sense making of another thing um the thing in of itself just
needs the free energy gradients it just needs to self-evidence by moving in the direction of maximizing the on average
the log evidence for some abstraction which is a generative model um but it
doesn't need to know that um um just to you know so we don't confuse people so
moving up those log evidence uh gradients very much like um you know
paradoxically moving up uh concentration gradients to Clump together to keep in this attracting set and to resist the
dispersion of the random fluctuations inherent in these random dynamical systems is just the same as moving down
the negative log evidence which is the um um the uh the free energy itself it's
it's it's it's the same thing so what does that mean well it um what it means
is the jint model is something that you bring to the table to um endow
the behavior of this thing with an explainable teleology um of the kind it looks as if
this thing is acting in a way to maximize the evidence or gather the
evidence for its generative model and this is what I think its generative model is but notice the thing in of
itself doesn't go through this process um it could of course so if I now people
things like you and me we we do have a model of mod we do have
um and we communicate it and we talk about it but most things you know um um
um uh most things would not would would not possess that um that deep structure
so you can invoke hular you can invoke self-modeling you can invoke um
um your uh the kind of um not hermanus in in the
sense that you would normally um um end up with an um you know with with an
infinite regress but you know the the kind of metacognitive aspect that comes
from any deep or deeply structured hierarchical generative model
you you you you can you can get that sort of humulus like Detachment and metacognitive uh perspective on things
but strictly speaking um you know the generative model is is is is only entailed by the den DCS and I should say
that you know this is probably best to think about um you know applications of
the free energy principle in you know in in um as being limited to simulating and
modeling and understanding other things as opposed to oneself unless one's doing
a lot of self modeling um so so in that sense you are
ascribing um a teleology a purpose um um
that would explain the behavior of something that you're observing but notice because you are observing it from
its point of view you are an external State and from your point of view all
you can see is the Markoff blanket you cannot see what's going on on the inside
so it is um it would be mathematically impossible for you to ever know whether
what's going on on the inside is indeed um um describable as even a gradient flow
on a free energy functional um let alone did it have its own internal model did it had it have its own beliefs it just
looks like that from your point of view because you'll never ever know by
definition if you knew then you would um by definition have breached the markof
blanket and that thing would cease to exist as the kind of thing that it was before um I mean may sound obvious or it
may sound trivial um but I don't think it is if you just look at people like me
who spend our entire lives trying to peer through the Markoff blanket using brain Imaging for example and you know
or people doing um um comparative Anatomy by dissecting dead things um um
or by inventing new techniques to try to to try and get uh you can never get beneath the Markoff blanket but you can
certainly sort of um have certain perspectiv on the markof blanket that are closer and closer to the internal States but you can never actually get in
there I mean you know there's I imagine a whole philosophy on this that you you you couldn't um see your own um visual
processing you couldn't hear your own colear Dynamics um
you you you you can't um ever have access to the inside very much in the
spirit that internally would say you can never have direct access to the outside
um so I think that also applies to these stories about generative models and the basy mechanic interpretation of uh that
comes along with the uh with the free energy principle does that help in some way it's a little bit subtle and I can
just imagine a lot of my friends tearing their hair out because they have very particular views about this yeah some
people think it's it's a model of a model some people think it's you're taking very internalist some people external
mathematically um you know it's it's not the model which drives drives as you
know it is the it is the Dynamics which drives us and that Dynamics can be interpreted in relation to a generative
model should you want to excellent well I'm gonna follow that philosophical line of thinking
and what I want to ask is this is an interesting point that the notion that
we can get to a closer approximation of what the internal States of ourselves are for example but it's
always going to be an approximation because piercing the mark of blanket would constitute self disintegration
under the under the uh rules of or the principle the free energy principle per
se how how in a sense therefore do we know or or how how how uh how much can
we even make the claim therefore that there is such a thing as an external Dynamic that goes beyond anything goes
beyond our sensory in puts um it may seem like a deeply non-scientific
question but um you the way you were speaking couldn't I couldn't help but
think of people like George Barkley and even Canton this phenomenal Nal
distinction if we don't ever have direct access to so-called external
Dynamics because that is part and parcel of the the physical game that we're in
why can't we just say that there are no hidden States and all we get are probability distributions over sensory
appearances but we don't need something like a likelihood mapping to something that's
latent um well you you you you could say that and a lot of my friends do say that um
and I think in the sense that um the the notion of direct access means that um
you will never know in some sort of fistic sense um what the external states
are if they exist at all and and um um on the other hand you could also argue
um that um there is profound access to the um and existentially meaningful
access to the external States it's just organized in such a way that it it has
to be transacted by the Markoff blank blanket um so you know I haven't I
haven't this conversation for for for several years now so I used to have lots of Pat
answers which um depending on who who I was talking to but the the you the way
that you phrase a question which was very clever um this made me think well you know what is the internalist
argument does it mean that because I don't have direct access that the external states don't directly influence
me that means that they don't exist um is is you know is that the the argument
that an internalist would make well may might it be the case that all we have we
we don't need to invoke a kind of further realm a further causal realm an underlying ontological realm if all we
have are just the streams of sensory input and seemingly some regularities some patterned regularities in them why
at least in terms of doing the basian modeling do we need to invoke a hidden State an underlying cause for examp like
if we just take that if look at the low road TCT of inflence we talk about how human we talk about how cognitive
creatures like ourselves predict the world let's say at a very simple level I
a question I've always had is why do we why does the claims to predictive
processing or predictive coding more generally why does it make claims about hidden States why doesn't it make claims
just about regularities within streams of appearances that's the way that I would pose that
question right um
so I'm just mindful you've introduced uh predictive coding and predictive processing we have
we perhaps it would just just to for those people um who may not uh know that
the the intimate relationship between all these things so another way of looking at free energy is it's the uh
amount of prediction error and more specifically if you're talking to some people it would be the uh the total
amount a Precision weighted prediction error um which means that there's another reading of minimizing free
energy which is not the maximizing the model evidence but um minimizing
surprise where surprise is the implausibility of some sensory data um
given your model of that data so in exactly the same way that if I go around
Gathering data that I find uh continuously surprising um then that's basically
evidence I haven't got the right kind of model to be um to be able to explain I.E
predict those those data um so again we have one of these um um sort of
completely equivalent descriptions but you know that have very different uh flavors that to maximize model evidence
is to minimize surprise which is to minimize a prediction error which is to maximize predictability which is to
minimize very free energy and so on and so forth they're all the same they're all the same thing so when you're
talking about productive coding as a particular um algorithm for minimizing
free energy uh technically um you know a variational scheme which is known in engineer as a Calon filter um what
you're saying is I'm making certain assumptions um about my generative model um that means I can write down these fre
energy gradients as prediction errors so literally the prediction error my my Po
the Precision weighted prediction error literally is mathematically exactly the gradient that we were talking about
before um so just join the dots um so to
come back to your question um uh why is it that um I need to invoke latent
States in order to make sense of data um I would argue um that the sense making
is just explaining data in terms of Laten States um and those latent states
are often referred to in um you know in the technical literature as hidden
States and what do you mean by that well it just means they're unobservable from the point of view of the free energy principle they are hidden behind the
mark of blanket so I would say that detecting patterns simply is invoking
latent states that organize and structure those patterns um so um I
don't think there's anything magical about about latent States so the latent states that are if you like entertained
by your internal Dynamics and your sense making um uh are not the external States
you they are descriptions that are only relevant to the generative model that um
you need in order to define the prediction errors or the free energy gradients in order to um you know
simulate or describe um your sense making in terms of your neuronal Dynamics or your internal Dynamics or
the operations of say a thermostat but there's a Twist here um there's a reason
it's called active inference because it's got a big active at the front um so it's not good enough just to say oh I
can understand psychology just as making lots of sense of my sensory Impressions that's that's not good
enough um because you know you are um coupled to the world um in in in
reciprocally which means that you actually um are not only are you exposed
to the world but the world is exposed to you in an exactly symmetrical way and
what would that um you know how could one describe that and then we come back to where where we started with this
partition of blanket States into sensory and active States into the inputs and the outputs um which means that sense
making is quintessentially active so one way of phrasing that is that yes I'm
making sense of all this sensory data and all the patterns um but at the same
time I'm actually in charge of and actively soliciting those data causing
those patterns um so I think once you um once you bring that sort of inactive um
aspect to the table so notice um I Noti that you you you treated predictive
coding as a as a sort of generalization predictive process in it might be easier
if you did the other way around because then you have the grace to um
accommodate action in predictive processing its most General sense and if you don't then predictive processing you
know I think is an incomplete story you have to have um as part of the processing the active solicitation the
um the garnering and the structuring and quering the world in a way that
reciprocates with the right kind of information that allows you um to do the
good sense making in terms of um you know the latent states that we that we're talking about um I mean forly I
this takes us um into another part of the story we didn't previously unpack
about active inference so somebody might ask well Okay so we've got this um um
application of a um a free energy principle that a physicist might be quite comfortable with um to um behavior
that entails some kind of sense making um cheekily with you know I like to call this sening Behavior then I get told off
for that um but um so uh so how does
this differ from um reinforcement learning you know how how how you behavioral psychology um it differs in a
quite fundamental way U because the big thing that active inference brings to
the table is is that um first of all it says you are in charge you are actively
uh sensing you say this is Active Vision active perception active inference in this most General sense um which means
now what are the imperatives for generating your own data now you could
if you were doing behavior of psychology you of of a behaviorist sort in the 20th
century you could say well I just want to generate those Sensations that I found I'm rewarding um and so I got some
um privileged sensory um channels that um I'm going to label as as reward and
I'm just going to act in a way that maximizes the reward that comes in from
the point of view of the free energy principle that's not what that's not what happens what happens is I want to
find those data that resolve the expected surprise or the expected free
energy consequent on acting soliciting those data so what's expected surprise
well technically it's an entropy it's just a measure a mathematical measure of uncertainty so what that means is that
the um the the description of things that persist or exist over some
particular period of time um reduces now to a kind of basing mechanics in which
the behavior will look as if it is information seeking and uncertainty
resolving um it will look as if it is responding to these epistemic affordances under constraints and it is
those constraints that um um if you like would be the homologue of the reward um
they are literally the constraints endowed by the prize on The generative model the kind of um sensory states that
that constitute this attracting set you know to which I am attracted but the the vast majority um of the drives for good
um good behavior or sort of behavior that things that exist would evince um
is this resolution of uncertainty this information seeking and indeed you know
um that leads you into considerations well what what is the how would you
describe that kind of information that optimal uh information seeking behavior
um if you were a scientist or um if you were an engineer and if you were a
scientist you'd be looking at the principle of optimal basium design um
articulated by people like Dennis Lindley in the middle of the last century um where you measure the quality
of an action in terms of the Information Gain afforded by the data that you
secure by acting in this way exactly the same idea um um emerged in the context
of active learning in machine learning you know this is the problem if
getting data is costly what data point would I need to resolve the greatest uncertainty about my um beliefs about
the latent causes of those data um so Active Learning again notice actives uh
your actives um your um an explicit part of this process
so in answer to your question about you know would it be sufficient just to
understand sentience in its most basic or Elemental um
form as discovering patterns in data I would say no um because that
denies the openness of Any Given system immersed in
her World um in two directions you know the world influencing you and you
influencing the world and since you put that into the mix I think it's very difficult to conceive of any construct
um possibly not in in philosophy um but certainly any construct in computer
science or um um uh or physics that
would um um that would permit a complete
description of senting behavior just in terms of sensing patterns does that make sense yeah yeah
that makes sense that makes sense um makes sense to me um yes I want to stay
on action for a second because I think the the notion of uh the
minimization of free energy or the maximization of mod 11 makes some uh
could make some intuitive sense for an agent like ourselves in the sense that
we we have our sensory inputs which are Divergent from our prior and we act to
change the world to make those those sensory outcomes more in line with our expectations our
preferences however at a more fundamental level uh one one definition
that we spoke about the free energy principle is that the internal and external States look like they're tracking one another across a mark of
blanket now a question that comes to my mind when when I see a definition like that which is I that makes sense for me
uh for a sentient conscious human but what would a stone be tracking or what
would a drop of oil be tracking to use an example that you've um used before I
think so using going to something a bit more less animate and I presume the
answer lies in animacy um I think would be a really interesting Avenue to go down because it
gets these fundamental questions of how does something as minimal as a particle retain its
particl and and and what does that really look like when when we don't when we presume that they're not conscious
unless we're pan pists but we won't go just down that route just
yet well that's where you were taking us which which is a fun place to be um right how does
how does one um elude pan psychism in the free energy principle I well I think
you you've just you've just uh answered your own question there but so perhaps
we just unpack that a little bit um yeah so what's the difference between a stone
um and a thermostat and and and me um and I think what
you're what you're now asking is um are there um what I will call Natural kinds
but I wasn't allowed to because that has a lot of philosophical baggage but for the purpose of this conversation I'll just say are the natural kinds of things
um that display different kinds of behavior that can that can be equipped with
different kinds of teeology and I would say absolutely uh and you've just rehearsed
you key so as you noted um to be animate
um is a big thing um in the sense that the stone is not animate um in the sense
that it moves itself you know Stones started you know wandering uphill or flying around that would be much more
interesting um but they don't have that animacy that is characteristic of biotic self
organization so what does that mean in a sort of um deflationary sense of the
free energy it just means that the active states are an empty set um and usually um for Stones you might also
argue the internal states are empty but you don't have to yeah the stone can be
um you know making sense of its World in terms of its latent States or can acquire that inter interpretation
perhaps that's a nice example of what we were trying to get um drill down on earlier on in terms of um is a
generative model I mean I one could argue that a stone has a generative
model of external mure in terms of the temperature and the latent variable
which is a hidden State it's a latent State you as well known in statistical thermodynamics which is a a sufficient
statistic of the distribution of things and the temperature uh um could well be
uh inferred by the internal the interior of a stone and therefore it is making
sense of the pattern of its sensory exchanges with the world on on the surface of the stone simply because it's
warming and Cooling and therefore tracking the ambient environmental temperature so that's perfectly free
energy principle consistent um it's a very boring kind of uh of sense making
but you know and it is that boring kind of sense making that I had in mind when talking about um if you preclude the
active part of active inference and just think about sort of perceptual inference
um then then you're sort of missing the point really um but I think a stone is a good example of that now would you say
the stone has a generative model well you could you could argue that but uh you know it's you trying to trying to um
if like explain the behavior of a stone but the stone doesn't have very much behavior um but you could you could
start to think well now I can test a hypothesis it is is actually registering um uh the the temperature on the inside
and again just to rehearse the argument the fundamental argument we were talking about before you will never know though
until you break the stone because once you brok the stone it's no longer a stone it's just a broken Stone uh so
you're exactly the same problems or issues confront you even with the stone but you know focusing on on that sort of
big move from things with and without active States I think then you're talking about things that are animate
things that have um animacy and act upon the world um is that sufficient to get
the kind of behavior that we've been talking about which is um you know the kernel of active influence in terms of
um what active influence brings to the table in term in terms of uh information
seeking and having a variety of different affordances particularly epistemic affordances um as an
explanation for for for um for behavior um you could argue no you a
thermostat can act upon the world it can switch heating elements on or off and it senses things by it by its Thermo
receptors and uh you could say like very much like a wats governor um it you know
it now has active States it has inputs and outputs and it has internal Dynamics and um um and in one sense the wats
governor is a good regulator and therefore conforms to um the cybernetic view of of of of a generative model and
it's acting in the right kind of way so does this kind of system um have that
the Curiosity that would be associated with information seeking and resolving
uncertainty and you would argue well no it doesn't so now you got another kind
of natural kind um which does so what's the difference between you know a what's
Governor or a thermostat or possibly a virus and um and me well I think the key
differen is a particular kind of um
self-modeling that just comes from being very big and a bit structurally
complicated in the sense that there are certain parts inside my body and inside
my brain that are so distant from the active states that are actually moving
um my arm my actuators or um are engaging my autonomic
reflexes that I cannot see them directly um and if that is the case the
only way that I now can sense the consequences of my action is vicariously through the sensory States now this
introduces a really interesting distinction between me and a virus it
means that I now will start to treat my own action as a hidden or latent cause
of my Sensations and that brings to the table okay well if now my own action is being
inferred as a random variable then now is a separation between what I think I'm doing or what my active inference um um
would um allow me to talk about in terms of what I what I'm planning to do or what I'm inferring to do in the spirit
of planning as inference and what I'm actually doing so this um brings you to
an even more a different kind of thing which would be something like me um that
now has beliefs about um its own
action um which is distinct from the actual real variables you know um that
constitute the active states of the markof blanket um and as soon as I have
beliefs about my own action I have to ask myself well as a physicist I would ask well
what how what what are the probability distributions over my um my active
States my um those states that um actually change the causes or the um the
the external States generating my Sensations and when you write that down um what you get is exactly what we're
talking about before which is this mixture of expected Information Gain basically expected free energy that has
come be decomposed into this information seeking part and the constraints afforded by your prior uh the prior part
of your generative model the things that you find very surprising per just to unpack that um um intuitively you know
let's take the predictive processing surprise minimization view of um self
organization and um an active inference and that means that I now have the pro I
am the kind of creature that exists therefore I must be minimizing my
surprise furthermore I now have beliefs about my actions I have pry beliefs I
must have pry beliefs about my actions of course this is all subpersonal so what kind of Prior would I have about my
my own actions well I'm going to um because I exist and I'm a um a free
energy surprise minimizing kind of thing because I exist then I must choose those
actions that minimize the surprise I expect following that action so that means I'm going to minimize my expected
surprise now there are two ways in which I can do that and we've already uh spoken explicitly about the two ways one
way is just to notice that the average surprise the expected
surprise um is just uncertainty so I can reduce my expected surprise or my
anticipated or my um average um surprise
um by um getting to grips and knowing you know what would happen if I did that
uh with greater Precision so this is information seeking this is the sort of the Curiosity um it's the novelty
seeking part it is the exactly the part that underwrites the um the basic the
principles of optimum basian design getting the data that minimize my uncertainty because uncertainty just is
expect surprise but there's another way of doing minimizing expected surprise if I know what is very
surprising if you know by being um um at very very low temperatures or being very
poor or being snubbed socially um everything that is if you like not
characteristic of me given that I am you know I exist in you in a particular way
um then any deviations of that basically uh can be thought of surprising so if I
Stray Beyond very much in the spirit of um homeostasis although now we're talking about Al estasis because we're
talking about the future um then I'm going to choose those actions don't just
uh do the information seeking responding to the epistemic affordances but also will elude those kinds of surprising
states that are very uncharacteristic of me being very poor missing out on that opportunity uh being embarrassed uh
being in pain um although pain is probably a bad example we're talking about the sensations that that we want
to want to avoid so um that would speak to this um um the prior um the prior
cost or the prior surprise the negative which was was the preferences you you mentioned before so um you can look at
these constraints afforded by the prior the pragmatic part if you like of um of
these affordances some people call them instrumental so you got epistemic and instrumental um affordances that just
are the expected Information Gain and the negative expected cost which would be the um your manifestation of the
constraints you could look at the the complement of constraints in terms of where I don't go in my sensory State
space um as um where I do go which are my preferences my preferred
characteristic attract attracting sets so uh just to remind myself and and you
and people who are listening still at this stage um why are we going through all this well because this is what comes
out of a consideration of beliefs PR beliefs
about the way active State Should unfold uh how and that becomes very pertinent
when now I have to actually um embody those beliefs in my generative model so
suddenly now I become something that is very distinct from a thermostat or or a
virus because now I have a generative model of the consequences of my action
and that generative model is very simple it just says a priori I will um a priori
think that the action that maximizes information gain and maximizes this
instrumental value uh are going to be the most likely policies and this you
you know could be construed as a um a high-end kind of planning as inference
it's not as trivial or simple as a sort of uh K control because we've got this
epistemic part part part of it but it still has a spirit of planning of
inference so what I'm saying quite simply is there are certain things that plan and there are certain kinds of
things that don't plan a virus doesn't plan the weather doesn't plan Evolution
doesn't plan the stone doesn't plan and you could argue that many um um smaller
insects don't plan but as you get bigger things then they start to plan and I
think you move from non-planning to planning at which point by definition
you are ascribing to these bigger things like you and me um a be
ascribing um a teeology to our behavior that rests upon a generative model that
includes the consequence es of its own action which crucially equips it with a
temporal depth because the consequences are in the future so unlike the
thermostat that doesn't need to look very far into the future things that plan that are so big that they um lose
contact with their actual actuators um now look as if they're they have this
sort of temporal depth and this this temporal thickness to their generative
models specifically enabling them to PL to uh plan in plan their actions in Into
the Future so that's how I would get out of the pan psychism
argument okay I've never I've never heard that argument before um about the
distance from the actuators that's very interesting um because it seems in that
sense that the temporal depth is Downstream on
size in a sense um is that is that a correct reading and and is there a
reading of your argument that you've just laid out there in which you can have deep temporal model uh modeling
planning as inference and um allostasis as well as a
sense of um retrospective inference without being a large thing is that or
is this notion of being uh far from your actuators so that you have to start
disambiguating what is your action and what is the action of the world or other people is that fundamental um yeah I
mean this this is a really interesting notion because I've I've actually never heard it really be uh elucidated like that so I'd love to know whether there
is a way that a virus could be doing deep temporal modeling despite its minimal size right yeah I mean to be
honest I don't know um but a a a sort of um an intuitive answer uh would be uh no
size really does matter it really does matter so by size I I you know I'm
implicitly talking about the um the the the sparse coupling that underwrites the
conditional dependencies in manical systems that give rise to mark of blankets and blankets and blankets so um
I'm not literally talking about you know how how how wide something is in terms of millimeters I'm talking about the
sort of um the hierarchical depth of of um condition dependences and being
secluded behind markof blanket after Markoff blanket after markof blanket so
um if you if you're comfortable associating um physical size with that
um hierarchical depth in terms of um what a thing is in you know in terms of
having this internal hierarchical structure internal markof blankets then I think the answer is very clear no you
have to have you have to be sufficiently big so I'd be extremely Sur surprised um
so for example I haven't said this before but you know I would imagine very
very small insects can't plan whereas um something the size of a bee might be
able to plan so I'd imagine that a droper couldn't plan but I I would imagine a bee might just be able to get
there and it and it it starts um you know first of all that that that
immediately speaks to a philosophical vagueness in terms of that temporal thickness which which which is
interesting I mean is it is it categorical you know can I say this kind of artifact um can be explained in terms
of a generative model that does not cover its own action because has direct access to its actuators because it's
sufficiently simple and small there are no Markoff blankets that intervene between the um the you know the um
effectively the the the sense making part and the um uh and for example
sending predictions and the predictive processing Spirit down to the um the actuators um whereas this thing is so
big that there are inevitably with probability one so many Markoff blankets that intervene there is no now direct
access to action upon the world um and um
so that might be a uh a bright line it might be a um a qualitative distinction
between things that do and do not have um uh a representation of their own actions
um on the other hand the counterargument I think would be this more vague notion that that you even even a
thermostat could be ConEd as having a little glimpse of the future simply because it could be um cast as say a PID
controller which basically um um invokes now rates of change and as soon as you
invoke rates of change you've got sort of your know a mathematical image of a little trajectory into the future so it
could be a great it could be a graded thing I've lost I've lost what the importance of your question what I ask
you a question again it was probably it was probably unimportant um but this is really sorry it
felt I'll go again this is a very interesting line that I'd love to I'd
love to dive down into so what so my interpretation of this my my reading of this is that in a sense having bundles
of Markov blankets embedded in Markov blankets leads to the inevitable
inference that there is something like me which is doing something and there is something that's not like me which is
also causing sensory um data that I'm receiving that makes
sense now let's let's tie in temporality to
this does it does this does this mean that in a sense
temporality is a coroller of selfhood in the sense that the selfhood is almost
more fundamental than the the temporality because it comes from the dimensionality of the things that are
Mark of blankets upon Mark of blankets and how can we integrate temporality and
temporal thickness or depth um into this picture right yeah that's absolutely
right and um you could tell the story in a number of different ways you know if you're talking to um for example Chris
fields or Maxwell ramstead and they might start talking about um irreducible
Markoff blankets um that necessarily uh require the notion of
nested Markoff blankets and that there is some one or more core irreducible Markoff blankets that would have um this
aspect of looking at one's one's own inference processes and acting
internally and they get the notion of mental action and you can then start to work towards um sort of qualitative
experiences in terms of self-modeling and what that might look like um the
other the other way that you could tell this story is to know that um to invoke
um the renormalization group if you were were we a physicist and just know that
when you're talking about any hierarchical generative model there is
um inevitably a a COR graining that includes time in that g in that depth um
which means very simply that the deeper parts of my generative moral and indeed
a viruses are on a free energy principle view um
um encoding beliefs about things that change more and more slowly as you go
deeper and deeper so there's a separation temporal scales um so you I a
common sensical view of this is that um the the neuronal representations uh down near my primary
auditory cortex or indeed in in in in the brain stem um are representing very
very fast fluctuations in um pressure and then frequencies and T and and sort
of scenographic like um um representations that are changing um you
know possibly even in fractions of of a millisecond if you're an owl um but
certainly over over 100 milliseconds then I move up to sort of you know primary auditory cortex and I may be in
the realm of sort of um hundreds of milliseconds and sort of frequency
Glides that Define phones and I move up to secondary auditory coures and then through the auditory hierarchy getting
to the level of um um words right up to
um say you know some parts of prefrontal Cortex where we've gone entire semantics and syntax and
narratives and stories start to emerge and as every time we go deeper into the
hierarchy we slow down or we extend the temporal Compass thereby providing a
context for the faster influences and fluctuations at the level below so again
we come to this um you know notion of um size
entailing um a um a a certain kind of depth in this instance a hierarchical
depth in the generative model that as you say necessarily goes in hand in hand
with a temporal depth and a separation of temporal scales so I think you're absolutely right there has to be a
temporal aspect to deep generative models and by Deep I just mean that
there are nested Markoff blankets so you know to define a hierarchy is only defined in terms of the conditional
independences um and implicitly the Markoff blankets of one level in the
hierarchy um that defines it as a level in the hierarchy without the mark of
planket the hierarchy would not be there so that's another example of this sort of um
um being open but being closed um um being able to individuate something
from something else and and this is as if the thing is just the level of a hierarchical a hierarchal generative
model that we're ascribing to um the Dynamics of of some internal of some
internal States I think there's a third story you could tell which is possibly where you're going which is um um how it
relates to to Consciousness um um in the sense and this is a very simple story
that that that um if I am
um forming beliefs and doing um belief basing belief updating as
prescribed by active inference about the consequences of my actions then that has to be in the
future as we' just said and perhaps certain things think deeper into the future than than other things um but
notice what we've done here it's about my actions so not only have you
committed to temporality um and temporal depth and temporal thickness as an
attribute of things that plan um and are more like you and me but you've also
committed to agency so now you've created from something that was previously not an agent into an agent
where I'm using agency in the sense that I one would not say that a thermostat
had agency but you would say that I have agency um in the sense that I have
beliefs about the consequences of my action and I um will or can be described as um
using those beliefs to select a particular action and you know coming back to predictive coding formulations
that that selection would basically I'm going to predict the state of my um Motor plant or my autonomic um nervous
system and provide with the right set points and and then the the active stat will actually reflexively fulfill those
prophecies those predictions um and everything is working properly I'll I'll be a good Alat or in R's terms a good
hom homat um so what what you've done there is is bring agency into the game
um and I think that again this speaks to the inactive part that you know you now
because you've got beliefs about the future and specifically the future that you have caused that you have authored
you have now become an agent so we have I think got this this stage to Consciousness and self-awareness but I
think we've got the necessary Foundation that there are only certain things that have to be agents I think to be
conscious of themselves as agents as doing things um as things that exist in
um um in a world uh in the sense that
their existence is Manifest in terms of the consequences of the way that they act upon that world if it wasn't you
wouldn't need any of this you wouldn't need this temporal thickness you just be you you you just need the apparatus of a
stone or a thermostat to make to do do your sense making but as soon as you got agency in the game I think then you've
got you've got something which takes a step closer to um having a very deep and
possibly it's this irreducible Markoff blanket um um um layer of the generative
model or level of a of a deep generative model which actually now starts to entertain the hypothesis
I am an agent um which you don't need but you could and you have to ask
yourself why would you ever want to entertain that hypothesis I am an agent um so this would be minimal selfhood
just a representation um that I can be in different states of mind when it uh that
and those states of Mind are something that underwrite or I can condition on it
in terms of what I'm going to do and that doing could be internal it could be how I deploy attention in terms of
precision weighting in predictive coding coding um so it could be covert action or it could be overt action I could now
um select um you know um certain plans at a lower level that would be then um
enacted by my motor system or my autonomic system if I was that that kind of
creature does that make sense it makes sense and there open up a
can of worms in my head um well inevitably because we brought in lots of Concepts here and I want to try and
unpick them um for people at home and for myself but it's fascinating so I'm
loving it so let's keep going along this along this road we've got agency
Consciousness and temporality as as these three things I want to have a little look
at starting with the first thing we talk uh you you mentioned as a response to my
question about temporality that we have a deep hierarchy in which um more deeper levels
of the hierarchy are tracking um slower fluctuations in the external Dynamics and therefore
contextualize and constrain the higher order faster Dynamics is it are we in this model are
we invoking time as a fundamental aspect of the external Dynamics or is it an
inference that the act that the um that the organism is making about the nature
of reality that it's experiencing um well that's that's again
an excellent question it's certainly um does not um
um it does not address time perception uh in terms of the psychophysics of time
perception um does it address um time in in a more fundamental sense I I don't
think it does um in a sort of um sort of folk psychological sense um it's really
um so the the answer to that question normally um is framed in terms of
relative movements in a belief space um and um so if you think of time as um
part of some Metric space time then what you're talking about is time as
something that can be measured time that has a a distance say milliseconds or
seconds on the like um could me um could
me as a generative model um um ever have access to or build um
hypotheses uh of time as a metric yes we certainly could um how however um it
would be very difficult um you're ignoring sort of internal clocks and the like well actually no you have to ignore
internal clocks you then ask how do you do it and normally what what the story
the story is um it's the the number of moves you make at one level relative to
another level of a deep generative model and the number of moves is quite crucial here in terms of tying that down
mathematically um and my favorite way of thinking about the number of moves is basically something called the
information length and the information length um refers back to something we've
mentioned before which is information geometry so as if you think of our um so
one picture of the free energy principle it's quite a technical picture but I think it's quite useful is that um our
internal say brain States or the internal states of a thermostat um encode a probability distribution a Bas
in belief a conditional belief about some latent States um which means that
for every state of the brain there is if you like a point in the state space of
all the physical states of the brain but each point in that space now stands in for a probability
distribution and that means that um this is a special kind of space because it is
equipped with a metric what is that metric well it's the K Divergence well
the pathal infantes small K divergences as I move through the space so this is
what this is what defines information geometry the the information geometry is a very particular um bit of
mathematics um or theorizing that applies to very very special State
spaces or manifolds where every point in that on that manifold corresponds to a
belief or a probability distribution so now what if the metric
is the um the K Divergence or you know the information length which is related
to the um the accumulated K divergences as I move from one point to another um
what we are saying is that the um the number of moves I make the number of
units as measured with the the um this kind of metric this information
geometric uh measure um which actually technically is this official information
um is is um basically um a description
of um the Precision by which I measure whether I've changed my mind so if we say that
I've made n moves that means I've changed my mind end times and I know that because I can measure the
information length and I've actually moved a a significant by a significant um or by a
measure that is large simply because it is large in relation to the Precision
that uh that provides the distance between any two points on this so what that
means to put it very simply is that time can be measured by the number of CH
times I change my mind at level n in my hierarchy divide divided by the number
of times I change my mind at the lower level so now you've got a relational uh you
can gauge time by the relative degrees of belief updating you know um the
information rate which is the you know um um um confusingly the the the rate of
change of the of the length with with time but where time is now uh contextualized by the level above or or
by the level below so you have this very relativistic view of time um and you
could have different levels you know I would imagine um if you you attend to different levels of your hierarchy you
could get a very different kind of time perception indeed we know that attentional set and um um in conditions
where um say taking psychedelics or uh in things like Parkinson's disease where
where you get um changes in the neurobiological encoding of uncertainty
and therefore this fishal information metric you can get distortions and different senses of time um so what I'm
saying is there are probably as many different senses of time as there are levels in a hierarchical model and it
can only really be measured in a in a relative sense in terms of how many
moves do I make at one level in for any given move at another
level so um that the what we've done now is if you like um take take temporality
off the table to the extent now that we're now just talking about uh movements in an information space or a
belief space that has this kind of information geometry these are really fascinating
issues uh I think yet to be fully explored um my my friend zaf um um has
done probably some of the best work in in um in this area um but you know it is
it is to my mind um a really interesting issue because you it really forces you to think about the um what you mean by
separation temporal scales and what we what what kind of course grading over
time is implicit in this kind of move from one level to uh to the next level
does that address your what you were what you were yeah I mean as I was saying this is
all really interesting um and again something I hadn't thought of um before
in terms of in terms of this in terms of this contextualization process being about
moves which implies to me that but there has to be like this sense of time is
contingent on these moves that are being done at the different levels of the hierarchy does that process itself not
imply some Dynam some temporal Dynamics how can one distinguish a move of 10 relative to a
move of five without having segmented moves in some kind of space-time geometry yes and it is exactly that um
segmentation that appeals to the information geometry um so yeah how
would you actually do that segmentation how how would you measure um the amount
of belief updating um in Universal or clock time um at one level of a
hierarchy and um this is where the information geometry comes in it's basically the number of different brain
states that you have entertained during your movement on this statistical
manifold which is also you know I think very nicely articulated in terms of belief updating so you can literally
think of this sort of um the space that would be traced out if I were to plot um
the activity of all my neurons um on every axis of some very high dimensional
State space that would be a statistical manifold my belief updating which is a continuous process my gradient flow um
is literally moving on this manifold the distance I move is the information length that literally scores the degree
to which I change my mind it's also mathematically The Information Gain um as measured well closely related to the
information gain as measured by the K Divergence between my prior and my posterior after I do my belief updating
and I'm moving on this manifold and the question question is you know how far have I moved U and can I segment segment
that into units and that's basically what the information length um you know allows you to do so I I love this
picture because um if you just think about what kind of flows on this
manifold would um be prescribed by the free energy principle because the free energy is a
functional of the uh beliefs um encoded at each point then the free
energy is a landscape on the statistical manifold so we are perpetually falling
downhill on this manifold the the free energy gradients are themselves and the free energy is itself changing because
my beliefs are changing so I've got this lovely itinerant you know model or
picture in mind where I've got a cical manifold it is now um where I have
gradient flow where I'm flowing on this manifold um using a gradient flow on free energy
where the free energy now provides a wadington like landscape chasing Minima
all the time and of course that chasing reflects the fact that the free energy
itself changes as you move around the manifold because your beliefs are changing and the free energy is uh a
function of belief um and then you introduce this uh this notion which I think is really important um
the notion that the high level of a a deep model um provides the context and
what would the context look like in terms of this free energy landscape well it means that the landscape would change
so you know I've got this gradient flow which is um um from um on a fast time
scale just flowing down the landscape down the landscape but at the
slow level the landscape is itself now changing all the time so I'm perpetually chasing Minima um and moving Minima
because the gradients themselves are contextualized and are changing slowly
so you get this deep structure to the temporal Dynamics um which has this very
non-markovian aspect so now we've got this interesting picture where things
like you and me that are big where big just means that there are lots of Markoff blankets that um constitute my
deep generative model um that enable this um separation of
time scales um you've got this picture um where each level is now providing the
landscape for the level below with very very fast changes but of course these are now changing the
um the landscape is itself changing so that now you've got a non-markovian
model of a universe that we know is maravian um so we know because we
started if you remember right at the beginning with this notion of a random dynamical system that is usually
associated with uh things like a lan equation or you know a maravian process
um so we're starting from a a maravian um Universe with effectively no
memory and now we've found things inside this universe that look as if they found
a non- maroven explanation a coar grained sense um sensible and sense
making explanation for their sensory Impressions that is quintessentially
non- maroven that has this deep temporal structure of the kind you find in language yeah the whole point of say for
example um you know hierarchal derish um um process models of natural language
right through to the uh current focus on Transformer architectures in large
language models they're all about breaking the maravian um they're all
about finding non- maravian explanations for what at the end of the day must be
uh you know a a Marco a maravian process and you may ask where does that come
from well um if we spend most of our time trying to model um input where that
input is generated by things like does and we are complex deep things that
generate non-markovian actions then in fact our universe now becomes non-
maravian simply because we have other things in it that are sufficiently big to have these deep generative
models and then you get into language and and communication and uh you know the itinerancy which is I think quite
unique to us you know I don't think you'll find this kind of Dynamics if you get too big um and certainly as we've
already discussed it it can't exist at a very microscopic scale so even in your head um your macro molecules in the 16th
um dendrite in the ca1 field of your left hippocampus that doesn't do any planning it's too small uh it doesn't
have that requisite depth of or nesting of Markoff blankets um uh so small stuff
can't do got have this separation of temporal scales and this particular deep
itinerancy and sort of um you know Marium breaking like
property but interestingly when you get too big um you also can't do it either
so you know the motion of the heavenly bodies the uh the moon and the and the
Sun and the like they don't plan um and you know it's interesting ask well why not well because they don't have um
because a lot effective because they're so big all the random fluctuation in
their world have gone away and you now um are left with classical mechanics so
you know you could sort of get terministic chaos in end body problems but there wouldn't be a
description um that would um be usefully interpreted in terms of planning as
inference or active inference in the way that we've been talking about so I think there's a Goldilocks regime you got to be big enough but not too big uh to do
this to do this kind of planning wow amazing yeah I mean it's um it's
bringing up all of these existential potentially fluffy questions in my mind um which I I I would like to sort of ask
at least one which is we could ask why let's take the macro structures the
celestial bodies black hole universe itself we could ask why why in a mechanistic
mathematical sense do they not um have this kind of non- Marian temporal
Horizon so there's a mathematical answer to that which or a physical physical in
the sense of being explained by physicists there's an answer to that there isn't necessarily an existential
answer to that um and I guess I I do not expect a concrete answer because I'm
sure there isn't one but Millennia has been dedicated to the question of The Human Condition and why maybe that
itinerancy is so fundamental defining of our nature which is that we can't seem
to kind of sit still we are open and the world is affecting us and we're affecting the world as you said and we're in this constantly Dynamic
coupling I guess I would love to just hear intuitive thoughts that you might have
on why the universe would unfold in such a way that you do have a goldilock Zone
um why why is it the case that things like
us have this one wondering openness rather than just being um
either in the soup or being firmly rigid
forever if you have any thoughts on that um you yeah not well formed
thoughts um but I mean it is a fascinating thing to reflect upon um I I
think the answers that that someone like me would give you would inherit from a
sort of um a classical view of um
physics as opposed to a Quantum information theoretic view uh so you may get a very different answer if you ask
somebody like um um Carlo relli or Steven Wolfram or um you know my friend
Chris Fields um but if you're happy with a sort of um 101 physicist's response uh
to that um the way that I would look at that is through the lens of the
renormalization group which just says that there the um the the things exist
at different scales and there is a um you are um looking for explanations of
those that that that scale free behavior in terms of laws that are dynamics or
lrin technically um uh that are conserved um over different levels and
for for the free energy principle that is just the um the Dynamics the gradient flow on the um uh on the free energy
defined at each level or each scale um and that leads you to then a view of um
the same kind of things sorry the same kind of processes and the same principles applying at each and every
Scale of the Universe so that you would at a very very fine time scale and a
very very fine um um spatial scale so
the quantum scale you would have uh lots of very very fast hot Stones moving
around uh where the random fluctuations predominate um and there is very little
of this kind of long-term itinerancy um now technically that
results from um um some as certain aspect of the way that you can always
decompose any Dynamics any gradient flow so I've spoken um about the Dynamics
exclusively in terms of gradient flows flowing down um the uh flowing down the
uh the free energy landscape say on a cisal manifold being my sort of favorite picture of that
um that denies a real another really important aspect of the flow which is
the flow orthogonal to that gradient flow uh known as solenoidal flow or
Divergence free flow um so the way that I look that I look at this um through
the lens of a sort of classical physicist that that would predicate everything on this random dynamical
system or Lan approach um is that you've got a Continuum between the very small
and the very big where now we're not talking so much um about sort of the the
degree of nesting of Markoff blankets but simply the um the the contribution
of random fluctuations to the Dynamics um and the important thing to bear in mind is that there is any Dynamics any
flow has this solenoidal part this conservative part and this dissipative
part that inherits from the random fluctuations so if you're very very
small then all the random fluctuations have not yet been averag away and the
dissipative part predominates over the conservative part the solenoidal part um
which means that at the very very small scales you are effectively in the world
of um thermodynamics where you're effectively ignoring the uh the
solenoidal part um so everything is disappeared you get fluctuation dissipation theorems um you know um uh
inte intergral fluctuation theorems you know and then you can drive generalizations of the second law and
all of that good stuff um and then as we as we get bigger and bigger and bigger
the what the course grining implicit in the um what's known as um an RG operator
in the renormalization group sort of I look at grouping and dimension reductions a course graining uh or
entails an averaging and as you average the random fluctuations average out to zero
so now the the dissipated part disappears and you just left with a solenoidal flow which is just the
conservative dynamics of Newtonian mechanics and leanan mechanics and the solenoidal aspect is just a description
of like the moon going around the earth and the earth going around the sun it's
things that have orbits stable orbits of qu periodic um um orbits that are
approaching deterministic Sy they are very very big so the interesting thing happens in the Middle where you've got a
mixture of dissipative uh Dynamics and conservative Dynamics what would the
conservative Dynamics look like well they would look like this sort of um
itinerant um um um oscillation it would look like the same kind of uh classical
conserved oscillation that the moon does but it will be much more itinerant it'll look like a a you know um a buyer Rhythm
it will look like a life cycle it will look it will have that property that we
associate with living movement so you know we talked before about the fact to
to um to be autonomous is to move it is to have active States one would also argue
that movement in and of itself is not sufficient you know the moon moves um
the oceans move um are they biotic in their self organization I think you'd be
looking now for a special kind of movement which emphasizes the solonoid a
mixture of solenoidal and dissipative uh dis dissipative Dynamics um so
sandwiched in between the very big and the very small is a goldilock regime
where indeed you do have this opportunity for the biotic kind of self-organization that characterizes our
existence that is um not only um manifest in terms of
delicately crafted solenoidal diversion 3 Dynamics but also nested at different
time scales so just think about all the different time scales that your um body
entertains solenoidal Dynamics um um rotational Dynamics from the fast gamma
oscillations again in that hippocampal neuron through to um your um cardiac
cycle through to your respiratory cycle through to the your dial Cycles through to your um um slower Cycles right
through to your life cycle uh and so on and so forth and then you take it up to
any scale you want um but the key thing the point being made here is that not
only do you have this ad mixture of disputed gradient flows that underwrite
self- evidencing this is in the Contex text of this solenoidal flow at multiple
scales at nested scales so again we come back to of this deep nesting um so on
that view there will be a Goldilocks regime and of course it is only at that
in that regime will you ever get systems that start to self- moral and communicate and co-construct their their
niches will you get cultural Niche construction will you get the kind of would you get language and will you have
conversations like this it's not going to happen um at the level of uh
macromolecules or cells and it's not going to happen at the level of heavenly bodies but it will happen at our level
um um uh and clearly has happened if I can believe my
senses yeah I guess the yes I guess the I mean my followup
my my inevitable followup would be why are there these different sizes but I don't I don't want to get into that book
it's just Turtles all the way down about
why I mean we we can bring it to CL very quickly but that's it it is Turtles all the way down that's I I think a
fundamental Insight uh and once you once you commit to that everything starts to make a lot more sense so um you know
just in terms of um you know how long will my Markoff blanket last well it
will last the you know for a long time at my temporal scale but the um the
scale above um will last much longer so I have an environment and a niche that
lasts longer than I do and my body lasts longer than anyone's cell and my cell
lasts lasts longer than any well intercellular component and you know
that component will last longer than any particular macromolecular uh configuration so uh so it is all the way
down and you need it at each level you have to have the context being a thing
having its own Markoff blanket at its scale in order to um provide the context
for the faster coming and going of Markoff blankets at the lower scale but in the same sense because the larger
scale inherits from the dyamics of the lower scale there's is a circular caety
which people like George Alice would cast in terms of top down and bottom up causation put simply what that means I
cannot exist well let's put it another way my hippocampal cell cannot exist
unless my brain is in good shape my brain cannot good shape unless I'm doing good active influence and relating
correctly within my family and my consp specifics my cons specifics cannot uh work uh exist unless there is um a
biosphere that sustains that kind of Life the biosphere cannot exist and and so on and so forth all the way up and
all the way down and every Lev there are things and those things have to have Markoff blankets and at every level they
can be construed as doing some kind of Elemental inference or self- evidencing
um the the story we're telling though is the special kind of self- evidencing that comes out at a particular scale but
the existence of that scale requires exactly the same um I repeat from the perspective of the renormalization group
it requires exactly the same Dynamics or LR or functional form of the Dynamics um
at you know at every level and you know on this view because the explanatory
Target or the free energy principle is basically relational it's trying to understand
self-organization um of a thing that can be individuated um in this context and in
terms of what it is contextualizing it's a very myopic um ambition it doesn't describe you know
cosmology or um you know the universe uh you're not going to get electromagnetism
from the free energy principle um um um and so it doesn't really have to worry
about when does this you know whe what is the largest scale what is the smallest scale you can keep on going all the way down and if you had to headed
your bets because I guess it is a hedge better bet hedger rather um does it stop
does does the is or is it just it just goes on Mark of blankets on Mark of
blankets yeah yes mathematically yes yeah there is yeah it's a little bit like you asked me
uh where's the um um where's the edge of the Earth when does the Earth
stop yeah if if if you're committed to the renormalization group um now it just
keeps on going forever um that um and you sort of I'm quite comfortable
with that because um you know it emerges from a sort of of um a question which is
what is a state so we've been talking gbly about State spaces cisal manifolds
and states of Affairs that hidden States and latent States um to have a state
space and particularly specifically to have a um a state space that be that can
be interpreted or construed as AAL manifold you have to have States but
what what where do states come from U and the argument sorry I shouldn't ask
you AR the argument is that they are the states of things where the things come
from oh we just said it's a partition of States space where did the states come from and if you try to answer that
question um then you all you have to do is basically um determine the mapping
between um things or particles and states and the answer is quite simple it is it is basically one way of looking at
this sort of um or using the appar apparatus of the renormalization group
that um the the the state of a thing is the uh state of its Mark of blanket
States um and then the um the then then
that state itself now has a Marian or a a a partition into maroff blankets so
you now get blankets and blankets um and so that you can resolve the par Parx or
the um the Catch 22 you know what's the state of something well what's a thing
well a thing is determined by conditional independen among the states
you know you can resolve that infinite regress just by saying it is just a recursion that you know States at one
level inherit the averages of the markof blanket states of things at the next
level but the at every level there are things so you have this um you know you
just keep on going down I should say um you know there are people who believe that um there is a smallest scale or it
is sufficient I'm not absolutely sure about this but if you ever get the chance in later life if you can talk to
uh again people like Carlo relli or Steven wolam um you know from the point
of view of quantum luk gravity and from the point of view of the ruad um then the you know there is this notion that
there is some irreducible um um smallness scale Beyond which you
can't go and then the game is how do you get a continuous world out of this sort of quantum discret um um very very small
description of things yes yeah yeah yeah yeah strange
Loops makes me think of Hof Stell and strange Loops also makes me think slightly of the um holographic principle
what you just mentioned there about projections onto the screen um this this
this notion of um reading of the mark of blanket you said something that I said
we had three things that I wanted to talk about um and we covered temporality all beit over a long temporal scale
wanted to very quickly ask you mentioned um in passing um about
celestial bodies being nearly deterministic and my ears pricked up um
I on an internalist model of the free energy principle I sense that there's
actually a kind of Licensing for free will because we have this internal model and we act upon the world as to confirm
the model that we we wish to we wish to observe on an externalist perspective
where we really are no different from another physical entity except for
the fact that we have the possibility of moving things and and acting to to
self-evidence there isn't so much space for free will but my ears picked up when
you spoke about agency and when you spoke about the celes your body's being nearly deterministic because it makes me
think it seems to imply at least uh
huris that being open to the environment being an itinerant being
licenses agents agency but I want to make sure this is true metaphysical
agency in the sense of not hard determinism um or whether this is agency
in the sense of self-conception as a free agent because those are two different things um it's
we won't be denying that we perceive ourselves to be free I guess the fun the more fundamental question there is
whether that's an illusion or not and so I was wondering whether free energy principle has anything to say about a
kind of libertarian versus deterministic perspective on Free Will um well I mean you could certainly
use the the the um the free energy principle to tell stories that speak to
those arguments um and I think you picked up on the some you know some of the key parts of those stories um so you
know deterministic chaos that you get with nbody problems when thinking about so massive bodies dancing around each
other um you know there is still chaos in mix in the mix um so there's an
unpredictability and sensitivity to initial conditions in in the good oldfashioned way of um non- dynamical
system System Theory of A deterministic Sort um but once you get to um you know
things like you and me um you're really in the world of stochastic chaos so the stochastic bit inheriting from the uh
the random fluctuations where you've got um two kinds of um if you like or two
aspects of uncertainty and implicitly then in modeling that uncertainty um um
uh the opportunity to talk about sort of Free Will and selection um one
interesting twist here is that the um if you actually want to apply the free energy Principle as a principle of least
action to things like you and me um what you have to um um imagine is that we are
deterministic things in a sastic and chaotic World um so in making sense of
things we only do so at a particular scale we're talking before about the
averaging away when I'm sufficiently big to average away my random fluctuations under the free energy principle that
literally means you have to take the average of lots of neurons so the kind
of sense making the kind of uh dynamics that you would simulate under the free energy principle applies to and only to
The Ensemble Behavior where you can average away any of the stochastic aspects so you will not get you will not
be able to deduce evidence or um um solicit or um find evidence for the
freey principle by looking at single neuron single synaptic it has to be at the The Ensemble level where the the um
well there are all sorts of arguments where that has to be the case but um from from our point of view it's when
the random fluctuations are averaged away um so I'm just qualifying what I'm
saying is I'm not saying that the brain is stochastic or shows stochastic chaos
what I'm saying is that the brain has to provide an apt explanation or approximation um to explain stochastic
chaos um and crucially um the um stochastic chaos associated with our own
behavior um with the consequences of our own actions so you got a deterministic system trying to now Model A
non-deterministic stochastic chaotic system um and you know in so doing well
that's easy to do because of course we're we're talking about um that modeling being in terms of belief or
probability distribution so that that's Absol abely no problem um so um on that
view I think you could easily motivate um Free Will of a certain kind um in the
sense that you when are when you're planning you have effectively to select
amongst different models of the future technically this we Bas in model selection and selection is an act and so
again we have a different kind of agency here but it has it's a kind of agent inherent in the selection amongst
competing plans or policies narratives paths to into the future um that I think has all the space
to um um say that this and it's you doing the choosing remember you can't
there's nothing on the outside that can influence directly that choice on the
inside so from your point of view you certainly have free will would it look
like you have Free Will from the outside um um I think that's a more vexed
question uh of course you'll never know but but uh I think you'd you probably
You' be in the game of of of a game practically how I spend most of my um um
day job is inferring to what extent is this artifact or this person um doing
good um planning as inference good planning um you know for example if
somebody's in a or in or asleep or has a psychiatric disorder um you know you you
need to know to what extent they are um
and in what way they are self-modeling um so you know um this is a slightly
sort of clinical and Abstract example but illustrates a point that you will never know whether something has free
will all you can do is infer that they are behaving as if they had a generative
model that entailed a self model and and thereby a model of the consequences of
action and therefore as if they were a true agent and possibly they may know
they're a true agent they may not you know they may be again um you know that would require another level of of the
Markoff blanket is that what you had in mind yes I mean I think um I guess the
the the kind of Hardline determinist response would always be pushing you to
say whether that organism or particle could have done otherwise so it may have this reflexive
quality of okay I'm doing basing model selection to my sense of self and we will come to Consciousness because I
think that's the kind of Crux of this issue is why is any of this happening online anyway but it it might have this
self um reflexive notion of being a free agent but the Hardline determinist from
the kind of external position of physics might always say well could that bundle of atoms ever have done otherwise in
terms of its basy and model selection but it's it's again it might just be one of
these sort of Loops that just keep spinning um yeah it it's it's all um
fascinating I had a question that I've just popped out of my head when I was talking about Free Will which was
um I will come back to it I it will come back to me um
Consciousness I know it's I don't know if it's being considered I don't know if we can call it a red herring yet in um
the academic world because it's become a very hot topic um and people are getting very heated about it and there's no need
to bring up particular examples of when people have got heated about it but people are very invested in their theories and I guess rightly so it it
seems to be this one thing that people can't seem to couch within their theories of
everything if they have one do you let's starting with very simple question do
you consider it to be a real problem do you take something like the hard problem seriously or for you is it more of a
meta question or can it or does a deflationary account just do the job in
terms of the hard problem um it really depends who I'm
talking to as my friend Jeff Beck would say it depends which pants I'm wearing so I think I think very much it's it's a
question of um a conversation and you have to you have to infer how much
investment the person you're talking about has in this issue and what position they're taking um and I mean
that you know just in terms of being polite and engaging you know with Integrity in scientific uh debate or
indeed philosophical debate but I also mean it uh in a slightly more fundamental way that Consciousness is is
an illusion um and but I think Illusions are fantastic they're literally
fantasies and I think that's what makes our brains fantastic organs I think they're hypotheses I think that the the
illusion is um the thing that we uh we test it is the thing that generates the
predictions in predicted processing so I think Consciousness is another illusion
um very much along the lines that one reading of Andy Clark's basing qualia
paper um um that even qualitative experience quaia are just Illusions
they're just things they're just constructs we bring to the table including selfhood um they're just hypothesis illusions that are
particularly apt at um explaining everything that we sense and making good
sense of it as as a a parsimonious H hypothesis Consciousness itself I think
is ex exactly that because it only applies the hypothesis is that um is
this thing conscious or not only applies because there are other things in my universe that I'm trying have to model
like you so it's the question is not whether I am conscious the question is whether you are conscious and of course
we've already said that is unanswerable because you have a markof blanket so
it's an unanswerable question but crucially it's a question about the
things are observe that I'm trying to make sense of um it only becomes I think
um only in in the spirit of the metah hard problem or The Meta problem um it
only becomes um um vexed when you make
the mistake of asking am I conscious I don't think that's what the question is there that's the illusion is not for me
it's for you uh the illusion is the Consciousness is a construct a hypothesis and a very plausible and all
the evidence that I have at hand would suggest that you are conscious and indeed literally because there is that
evidence um it is there in the sense of an Evidence maximizing illusion hypothesis or component of my generative
model um so I I go through that just to make it clear that that you the answer
depends upon who you're talking to but also who you are trying to um ascribe Consciousness to so if I was talking to
um um well if I was talking to um people like
yakob ho um um you the first thing he'd say is that the free energy principle is
not a theory of Consciousness and in fact he likes saying that every every at every opportunity so so there's nothing
there's nothing um there's nothing in the free energy principle that has anything explicit to
say about explicit to say about Consciousness on the other hand people have used it in different ways to uh
address the hard problem um uh you could take the view that Andy Clark takes that
there isn't a hard problem and perhaps even with David charm's work recently on The Meta problem The Meta hard problem
that's probably a more interesting problem um or you could you could grasp the the nettle and start to talk about
it if you were talking to um my colleagues Chris F and and um um and um
Adam saffron and Maxwell ramstead and and listen but um certainly um so I
think inspired uh by something that you mentioned earlier on which was the holographic principle in um um in in
Quantum information Theory where the holographic screen now um plays the role
of of the Markoff blanket that separates the inside and the outside in terms of bulk reading and writing to um the um
the the um the holographic screen um if you're
talking to him um then he would start to talk about these minimal screens uh
these minimal Markoff blankets um and develop quite a quite a sort of nice
argument that if you can't reduce in the sense that we're talking about nested
Mark of blankets inside a markof blanket if there are no more reductions at hand
then the only way that the internal states of that irreducible Markoff blanket can know about their own existen
is by acting upon lower levels and therefore there's some um there's
something unique there there exists a unique Mark of blanket that that that
you um maybe um uh have the attribute of
of Consciousness um if you're talking to somebody like van Vice um um he would
you know tackle this in terms of um trying to resolve uh a dualistic
position by offering a dual aspect monism um of A maravian Sort and that
rests very heavily upon this information geometry so if you remember before we're talking about sort of a state space
equipped with free energy functionals um on it um um that um plays the RO of a
cisal manifold but but there are two cisal manifolds that are jointly sit sit
in this in the same state space of say neural Activity one is that for any
given uh point there is a probability of being there from a point of view of
neuronal activity and the thermodynamics so this would be a thermodynamic um kind of information
geometry and then the other one is what the free energy principle uses which is the encode using that point to encode
beliefs about external States so you got two um information geometries belief
structures if you like um that supervene on exactly the same um material um
process one of which is pertains to probability distributions or beliefs
about the internal States and the other one is probability distributions or
beliefs encoded by the internal States about the external States so you could
construe one as being the mental and one as being the material and then you've got this dual aspect monism where you're
now asking questions about well what are the lawful relationships between the thermodynamic free energy and the um the
um the variational free energy that pertains to beliefs about things so you've got now a mechanics that talks
about beliefs and that may well be one way of repairing that sort of a dualistic approach um there's another
another perspective which you would get if you were talking talking to talking uh to people like um Julio tanon and um
SEL um well my colleagues involved in a one of the Templeton Foundation absera
research uh um collaborations um where you're trying to find Bright lines between the free
energy principle and integr information Theory um um which is not necessarily the best
thing to do because a lot of integrated information theory is exactly consilient with the free energy principle however
if you are going to get funding uh by uh trying to tease them
apart then the thing that distinguishes those approaches to um uh Consciousness
is really the the active part that we were talking about so uh boiling this
down in a way that some like I repeat yakob Hoy might might articulate this is
It's the difference between seeing and looking you know to be conscious I have to look it's not enough to see um it's
um you know to be conscious I have to listen it's not enough to hear uh so
you're putting action into games there active sensing this this sort of closing the the loop between the inside and the
outside may be um the thing that um is
necessary for Consciousness and simply because you're saying that Consciousness
is an attribute of agents and agents have to act what do they act on their
Sensations what does that mean they they do active sensing so to be an agent is
to be an active sensor yes active inference um and you if you're saying
that things that aren't agents can be conscious then you wouldn't worry about that but if you are committed to a deep
um to the notion that to be conscious um of to have a minimal selfhood um then
you have to have the notion of self if you have to have the notion of self then you have to be an agent if you have to
be an agent you have to um um have generative models about the consequences
of your agency your actions uh and that has to have the temp then we go through
all of those nice links that we were talking about before with temporality and and you know and the like and indeed
the hierarch structure takes us back to the Chris Fields um irreducible um uh
holographic screen or or um or Markoff blanket so that would be the way that I
would um converse with that crowd uh
uh I run out yes I run out of people that I might talk about it so I have to
find out what you like and then i' I'd tell a story that that you like or let you tell a story that uh that you like
well I guess my question to you would be can you imagine a world of self
evidencing can you imagine okay let's put it another way can you imagine a perfect replica world like ours where
the lights are turned off entirely there is no consciousness or is it do you
imagine it's a necessary uh consequence of the way that creatures are like like us are
structured that to do deep temporal planning to do planning as inference what whatever it is or self hooding we
need Consciousness could there have been another way that the Universe would have unfolded without us being
online um I suspect not um sorry I I'm torn between um um been taken by you
down sort of your philosophical zombie uh routes versus um another um story
that comes out of the free energy principle about Consciousness which is um the um the the the importance of
self- modeling in relation to other modeling and the fact that we are actually living in a world um of things
like us so and one story I didn't cover which is a story you would tell tell if
you were talking to um my friend Chris fth or people who are much more interested in the sort of social
neuroscience and uh or say attachment Theory um and you know developmental
issues um that are induced by a sort of evolutionary psychology view or Niche
construction for example all of these views of Consciousness means that Consciousness is just there um which is
where I started to infer um the state the disposition the intentions State of
Mind of somebody else um why and how can you do that well you can only do that if
that thing is sufficiently like you to to be able to use your generative model
um as OB say your physical actions as a model of their physical actions to infer
their intentions and the like um and when one takes that to its limit then um
often what the real problem is is not in terms of inferring the content of some
communication or some uh exchange of of um semiotic cues it really is inference
about agency again it's did you do that or did I do that so that ambiguity now
requires you to have a model of self versus other so it's a much more
relational um um notion of self so you know sometimes I think people talk about
minimal selfhood um as something which is monolithic I don't think that's necessary as part of a gen model it
certainly would be important to have um different um different kinds of self you
know am I embarrassed am I in love you know as we were talking about in you know in the um tmbb meeting a few days
ago that would be you expressive and very necessary part of generative model where I have to contextualize my own
emotional and pro-social and autonomic and moic behaviors um but there's no one
self it's a self you know self like this like this and like this a more fundamental relationship relational
aspect of selfhood is in relation to otherhood you know mother uh you know
versus me and am I mom or is is is mom a thing am I a thing I'm
the same thing as Mom you going to S clan um uh sort
of arguments there so put simply what that means is it may well be only in
universes or worlds that are populated by ensembles of conspecifics that are
sufficiently similar would you need to self Ood simply to distinguish self from other in a universe where there's only
me I wouldn't need selfhood so it would not be it would not
pay its way in terms of model complexity or model evidence to have the notion of me being a self if there's only me it
only pays its way if I now have to entertain the hypothesis that either I
cause that or you cause that so the question now is is it inevitable that
you get a universe with lots of similar things emerging all disambiguating themselves
or attributing agency to themselves in the gold uh in the goldilock zone I
think it probably is I think that would be I think if you simulated sufficiently accurately
artificial life I think you would you would get the emergence of um populations of similar things and they
would Niche construct um and they would be thereby Drive their own um sort of
Nest increasingly nested and um structurally complicated um or at least
sparsely um structured um uh organizations in terms of their Markoff
blankets um and that this would um this at some point would inevitably invoke um
modeling of others and therefore almost by default a a a a a minimal notion of of of
selfhood I think that would be emergent you but it would require being in the
Goldilocks regime for a sufficient amount of time for this kind of Niche construction uh cultural Niche
construction to actually play out so you know you'd have to have this very slow time scale providing the right kind of
context for this this kind of thing to uh thing to emerge yeah yeah I think my well I have some I
think I have some sympathies to the to the argument that Charmers would have laid out in or did lay out in
95 in his original hard problem paper which is that I think I can still ask
the further question which is can systems like me make the functional distinction between myself and others
without there being a sense of what it's like to be me can that just be an offlin
which is done purely in some algor rhythmic manner which need not involve some qualia of my
selfness so yeah there there's a point that there's an element in me where I
don't want to say that that in a sense resolves a hard problem because at least
I can hypothetically Envision that being done offline um I wonder whether you've given
much thought to Mark SS's idea which is that Consciousness might be rooted in
affect because this seems to me to be a bit more of a self-confirming idea which is
that feelings must be felt now I think there's still an open question there
which is affect arises at the point of uncertainty uh and drives us to resolve
uncertainty and when we do so we feel good about ourselves now again I still think when I was reading his book I
still had this open question why would that have to why would why would affect even emerge in that place why wouldn't we just have this drive to resolve that
uncertainty without there being the onliners so at least for me although I may be wrong and I'm very happy to be
wrong there is still no simple parsimonious explanation which can get around this um this point that Charmers
makes which is you can give me the function but you still you can't give me the explanation power why it needs to be
online um and I wonder if there ever will be some mechanism which is
sufficiently which isn't just purely tautological or invokes consciousness as
some fundamental reality which makes me which makes me wonder whether you've heard of Donald Hoffman whether you're
familiar with his work yes because I sense that in some
ways it has some interesting implications maybe for the
free energy principle in the sense of space and time not being fundamental units of
reality we've been speaking a little bit about how um where do space and time
come from how much do space and time overlap in the sense of generating um like we need expans
expansive creatures like us with embedded Markoff blankets inevitably have a sense of temporal modeling and
there's these interesting interactions does the idea of space and time being what he would say applications on
a desktop does that have any real do you sense has any real ontological implications for fre energy principle or
is it a red herring um well you you've introduced two important things I forgot to mention
Mark SS there another friend so to Mark SS I would say it's all about this
irreducible Markoff blanket that acts upon the rest of the brain where is that action it's going to be in the neurom
modulat systems set the Precision the Precision is exactly that fisher metric
which tells you about how much you're updating your beliefs it is the way that you do mental action it is as you
intimated um feeling in the sense that it is quintessentially balanced by
increasing or decreasing the Precision or uncertainty so um you know that's how
I would tie in Mark's um formulation to which I think is internally consistent
with um say Chris Field's formulation or um Van's formulation so Mark SS focuses
you know on those I think a key aspect of um of active inference which is uh if
you're a psychologist it would be attention it's basically acting in a way on the inside to um get the an estimate
and deploy the right confidence or the right Precision in um um mathematically
the curvature the of of of the um the free energy in and of itself um getting
that right um and um you know that has a lovely you know connection to attention
means that you can't divorce um Consciousness from attention you can't divorce it from agency in the sense of
mental action or internal action you now have a deep connection to um Thomas
metzinger's um distinction between you know um opaque and phenomenal
transparency um and uh and the way that Mark would tell the story would be that this is just feeling and feeling is at
the heart of of any qualitative experience um so you yeah thank you for
the for reminding me he was one person I forgot to to cover um the uh the second
thing um you know the the space and time being Illusions um I mean yeah I sort of
start off there so I'm not quite sure that it uh so if you're saying that
Donald's um and I should say he's a friend I think I've never met him but I think he's a friend of chrisfield and
Mike Levin so you know there's a a small world here um but if if you're just
saying that um space and time are um Illusions in the sense that we were
talking about Illusions as being fantastic and the thing that makes us into fantastic little beings and have
beings and um uh and our brain into a fantastic organ yeah absolutely I mean
you know the question for me is why on Earth would you um what what what must
be the case for us to have this illusion of SpaceTime and that we are living in a metric space and it's practically very
important I mean a lot of people spend a lot of time in machine learning embedding things in metric spaces um and
sometimes it's very difficult to see what licenses then to do that uh you can certainly see how it would work in terms
of projective geometries in metric spaces um but the Deep question is why
you know you know I can't um I can't imagine a um you know an amoeba really
having having a notion of of uh space um I may be wrong um and so knows um um you
know if you listen to people like um um Steven walram um you know the notion of
SpaceTime um itself May the illusion of SpaceTime itself may be just an artifact
the fact that our sensory organs respond very very slowly in relation to the
speed of light so if light traveled very very slowly or imagine a world in which
um um we saw with sound and sound was very very very slow um would that would
that be would that give you the illusion of space um you and distance at an
action of the kind that you we sort of implicitly assume when we're talking about sort of visual objects so I think
he has this nice notion that you know in this kind of World um with these kinds
of sense organs um you know when something moves from here to here is it the same thing anymore because that's
what you're saying when you have a metric space in which objects move um you know some certain symmetries or
invariances are inherit from the notion of movement in a metric space but that
may well just be be be be a fantasy we got gone off qualitative experience in
the hard problem yeah well no I by it all it all ties back it's a Beau it's it's it's a very good question which is
why would this why would space and time be a an the interface for us I guess that is the Deep question
um and yet it appears that that at least it it it is something at least in
conscious awareness I did remember my question and it actually feeds into the
last couple of questions I will have which is you mentioned um that you spend
a lot of your time inferring in the technical and Layman sense whether other
people have I think you say good generative models there's an interesting question
here I think which which I may have had intuitively when I started reading about active inference which is is there any
such thing as good self- evidencing in the sense that I may so so a lot of as
of course you know as you wrote a lot of the papers a lot of psychiatric disorders and psychological disorders
have been rooted in um disruptions to Precision waiting mechanisms for
example can we consider are the words good bad optimal suboptimal are the
these useful terms in this context or is it that that individual has a set of
priors which are different from you and I and everyone else and we all actually have a sense of we all have kind of
different prior so all self- evidencing in unique ways and yet philosophical vagueness allows us to Clump us together
into a group is there such a thing as what it is to be a good self-evidence as a human with beyond beyond just a
trivial point that we're not just dissipating into the the Heat right yeah that's an excellent question
um so I I think the answer to that is yes um but as you correctly um pointed
out it should be qualified by the um the complete class theorem So you you're clearly referring to the complete
classroom so it might be just wise to um just Define what that means and the
implications for discussions of good and bad um um generative models um so the
complete class serum way i' like to summarize it is that for any given pair
of behaviors and loss functions there exists some prior that render your
behavior Baye optimal which means that there is always a description of every
Behavior as base optimal under some prize so in that sense you can't be good
or bad um where the thing is basically your decisions because this inherits on
based in decision Theory so it's it's not quite as full uh active inference in accommodating um
information game but um within the within the um confines of phasing decision Theory you can't be um you
can't be good or bad you just have different priers so you my favorite example is that you know if we all went
to live on um on mars or a much heavier planet people with Parkinson's disease
will probably be much better have better prize you subpersonal prize in terms of
that don't be deficits because yeah they move more slowly and sort of more cautiously so yeah I think from the
point of view the complete class I think it's important to bear that in mind you know there are just different prize but
I I do think though you can sort of just say well hang on a second what about whether a good and bad prize and I think
then we get into this again this hierarchical story because of course as soon as you have a hierarch generative
model there are no prize you everything's an empirical Prime everything can be cont realize everything is conditioned upon
everything else including your prize and then you're just back into the um into the game of self- evidencing what is
good self- evidencing it's achieving a higher marginal likelihood or model evidence um how would you do that by
finding the right prize how would you do that by learning how would you do that by changing your model basic model
selection or structure learning um how would you do that in evolutionary scale you do basic model selection with natural selection so yeah um on that
view the log evidence as bounded by the free energy um is just adaptive Fitness
is how well your prize are adaptive to this world you are trying to explain so I think yes absolutely you can you can
you can be a good self- evidenc you can be a bad self- evidenc if you're a natural selection um that matters
because if you're a bad self- evidenc that means you won't be around um in the
um in the Next Generation so the marginal likelihood of you existing at an even ution time scale is low so the
your your evidence is also the probability that you will be found exist
you you will exist so it's quite important to get to be a good self- evidenc sir
and because that's your marginal likelihood of existing uh and I've now slipped in another syn synonym for um
free energy Beyond um prediction weighted prediction errors or Beyond on
surprise or surprise or self-information Beyond log evidence uh
it's also statistics called The Log marginal likelihood it's the the likelihood of your sensory exchanges
with your world your econiche having marginalized out or averaged away
all the unknowns which in this context are all the states out there you know
the hidden causes or the sorry the external states which you model in terms of hidden uh in terms of hidden causes
um so yeah I think it's very important to be good and bad at evidencing the measure of goodness of Badness is just
the marginal likelihood of the modal evidence and the free energy there is nothing else um uh if you're saying does
that speak to some creatures that will be able to actually assess how good they
are self- evidencing then the argument say absolutely um people like mattius
jofy um looked at this specifically from the point of view of emotion and
developed a whole taxonomy of emotion in terms of um rates of change of free energy and you get into stories of slope
chasing uh um looking for gradients and gradients and gradients of uh self-
evidencing on the measurement of the goodness of self- evidencing which is uh which is which is the free energy um
more refined stories more recent stories um would basically be looking at certain
kinds of uncertainty um being encoded explicitly in your generative model as underlying
affect uh particularly the the your certainty about what you're going to do next for example then we get back to um
the story that Mark SS would like to tell which is um the Precision of your
beliefs is the most you know the most important attribute that defines um you
know its veillance and that your your feeling at this sort of minimal
effective level yeah yeah the complete class firm is an interesting one because I think it leads people it leads one
into a potent these potential strange conclusions um it makes me think of
animals that commit suicide oddly so um I think sort of AIDS might explode
themselves in the context of a predator It ultimately comes back down
to your model evidence I guess so I am the type of creature that will commit suicide if I'm in the presence of a of a
ladybug of course but then those kinds of examples I sense for me show that the
words good or bad I'm just pushing a little bit back just intuitively the words good or back in in in in the form
of uh continued existence slightly put the cart before the horse because who said that that's the imperative so if I
existed in the world where my everyone's imperative was to no longer exist you know know God
forbid then that then I would be doing bad self- evidencing on that standard if
I didn't if I continued to persist so is there a point at which even the yeah
like do you see how well do you see that argument holding any water um or is it
just now we're just s dissolving into semantics well no no I think I think
it's an interesting thing to to contemplate uh you you you you're you're basically I think undermining um that
particular argument by uh um proof abductory absurdum um so if you think
you are the kind of thing that will uh self-destruct or aviate or commit suicide um then uh you can't exist
because you killed yourself right yeah so I will be extremely
surprised um if there were any um uh common natural um um subhuman artifacts
that kill themselves I didn't know about the aphid example very I mean obviously Lemmings is is the sort of popular
culture one but um um you I think they'll be extremely rare and you and
then you have to understand the um selection at an evolutionary or transgenerational level um um in order
to apply the free energy principle um but in you know I think you're absolutely right
I'm very mindful that a couple of weeks ago I was asked to review a paper applying Act of inference to suicide and
it was a very Artful paper um and uh I do remember thinking I'm not sure
whether the point was made implicitly or explicitly in the paper but you know it's it made me think in exactly the way
that you were you were um talking about um you know the imperatives to survive
and and are they the right way to think about the causes of our behavior um I I
would say absolutely not not this is not about um wanting to survive this is
simply wanting to avoid uncharacteristic Sensations and then we put a post talk
hypothesis oh that's because I want to survive then right but that's a fantasy that's another illusion uh so you know
we do not know what it is like to be dead so yes it cannot be well it can be
surprising but it certainly can't be the kind of surprise that you'd register in terms of a free energy so it's not that
we're frightened of being dead we're frightened um we are going to avoid bya
these pragmatic constraints um states that we've have inherited that um for
portend um cessation and dissipation and death death in in all itself is not at
all frightening we go to sleep every every um suspension of got to go to sleep every every night um so you know I
I I would I would um sorry yeah and the final point I think is I think what you
were doing though you were probably um creating a slightly vexed and
self-defeating argument by saying uh by assuming that um we can understand
things in terms of imperatives the whole point of the free enery principle is that there aren't any imperatives this
is where it starts as things that exist must behave like this and part of the
behaving like this means that you can interpret them as optimizing something and complying with imperatives but
that's just an interpretation that you'll bring to the table when you apply it to something else if you then apply it to yourself then you know then things
might get interesting you might have hard problems but there are no imperatives you know in fact even
minimizing free energy is not an imperative you can have the free energy principle applying to um things that
have very dissip uh dissipated attracting sets um that have very very
um High entropy um all it's saying is that there has to be a certain uh
gradient flow that count as the random fluctuations then you ask yourself well
hang on a second so why does it look as if we're always trying to attain some
very precise homeostasis um and the free enery principal would turn that on its head it
would say well look okay in some universes there may be very precise things um and these precise things what
would they look like oh it would look as if they were trying that they had um aspirations to EV evincing a very
precise homeostasis and indeed allostasis so you get this notion of another kind of natural thing which are
precise things um so if precise things exist it would look as if they um they
are um compelled to comply to very specific
imperatives but from The View it's not saying they exist because they comply
with the imperative it's saying existence implies it looks as if they have this imperative right now one final
point you know I'm I'm aware that we' we've now approaching three
hours well final point though I you introduced the word optimization I think
that was um the right a right and important um um
thing to introduce because you know it's only when you bring free energy into the
game as a bound on marginal likelihood or self the negative lock marginal
self-information or surprise or surprisal do you convert an existential
description into an optimization problem so that's exactly the move that Richard
fan made when he introduced variation free energy he had this impossible marginalization problem that to actually
evaluate the marginal likelihood of paths so exactly the same kind of problem that we're talking about in
terms of uh what my prior over policies and plans and paths into the future um
you can't you can't evaluate that exhaustively it's analytically and practically physically not realizable so
the marginalization problem the true inference problem if you like uh the
true existential uh problem if there is one um cannot be solved but what you can
do is introduce this and turn it into an optimization problem so just by using
free energy um or just by appealing to this Tey that comes from um predicate
everything on this evidence lower bound you are actually saying that it looks as
if creatures that exist are optimizing something what does it look what are
they optimizing it looks as if they're optimizing a bound on their um marginal likelihood or their adaptive Fitness um
what does that look like well it looks exactly like basing inference uh or if you're talking to somebody machine
learning it would look as if you're um optimizing your negative variation for Energy is known as an elbow so this is a
evidence lower bound it is exactly objective function used in um sort of high-end neural networks like variation
Auto encoders um so you know I think that the distinction between um just
being and optimizing is quite crucial and you're absolutely right that once you make the move um of um framing
things in terms of variational bounds using variational calculus or variational Bays um then you have
actually committed to an optimization narrative but you didn't have to just to
exist you you you could uh yes yeah yeah I I was gonna have this funky
philosophical argument about needing to exist to predict but I won't go there I won't go there um because we are going
to wrap up all of this philosophical mathematical thoughts has and
Consciousness thoughts has brought to my mind Thomas Nagel um Thomas Nagel has this idea that death is bad because life
is inherently good and we've been talking about life and being and what it is to be and what
one needs to do to be and persist to be if we're going to wrap everything up
is there a sense in which that kind of related to what we were just talking about in terms of imperatives of course
there is no imperative to be in any sense but you said it was an interesting thing you said there was it looks like
we are all being anyway right even if we didn't have to it looks like we are there's no
God granted plan for us to be but we seem to be doing it anyway does any of
nagle's romantic philosophical idea that life is fundamentally good being is good
does any of that resonate with you um yes it does because it's it's
it's you know it's nice isn't it and I you'd probably you you'd probably sort of
license that with with um phrases of the kind that you know to exist is to be
curious um so this speaks to this sort of um you know the ability to respond to
um epistemic affordances and certainly you know to exist as curious creatures
um is obviously the good way to exist in you in any given world and it's you and
would be mandated um I can't resist saying though of course this only really applies to you it doesn't apply to me so
so you are good because you are curious and you exist and I wish I could say the same
for me but I can't strictly speaking but you could if you wanted to I could I could abstract to you in some degree I
could infer that there is a you great um and then I guess we can wrap it up there
with one more question we've just spoken about life being good I'll flip the question I don't
think I've ever heard you talk about death although we briefly touched upon it um I won't make it too personal
but if life is kind of good in some sense because of the concomitant parts
of living as we do as I don't know if it's good to be a stone but it's nice to be me having these
conversations would that make death bad is that is there is there a is you said
we fear dying because we fear in an affective sense um that which
we don't expect to the states we don't expect to embody and in some sense we
don't expect to embody death because it doesn't fit in with our priors but beyond that free energy principle
perspective is there a broader position in which just returning back to the
fabric of the universe is bad is there something to say about re-entering that
Mark of blanket does do my markof blankets dissipate um what what does
that process look like and and does that strike fear in you or strike
awe um well more or but I don't want to overstate it
um it is it is beautiful um from a from a p mathematical point of view um so I I
have a very sanguin view of this and we've already said you know you've never been dead I've never been dead so no one
can tell me it's an unpleasant experience um so I I'm not particularly
I I I'm not going to um avoid being dead I certainly think all the all the paths
to being dead Pro probably very surprising and unpleasant so I'm going to avoid those death in and of itself I don't
think is uh is sort of um quintessentially bad um in the same way
that um Nal being curious and being engaged with the world is a good is it
is good while you exist um um um I think that's perfectly okay but I think death
is um or the life cycle let's call it a life cycle that it's slightly less um um
imbued with um morbidity um the life cycle is is is quite important because
um if you just look at um if you just take this um multiscale um um view of um
self-organization cast in terms of this basic mechanics um that you know for
example natural selection being based in model selection um then um if you put
that together with what we're talking about before about um ecosystems and Niche
construction constantly changing the lived world then what you need to do is to do
constant Basin model selection um in order to get the right structures very
much in the spirit that we talking about before where there are good priers and there are bad priers in the sense of the
marginal likelihood or adaptive Fitness to learn earn those good prize
you sometimes have to start from scratch again um with a different structure and of course this is exactly what pay in
model selection does via structure learning at an evolutionary time scale will entail death so that picture
basically says that we have to keep refreshing soort of sometimes cast in terms of Bas opal forgetting so we the
fact that we die are Bas is is could be construed as a base optimal forgetting
where we are the environment's memory of what is good for this Eco dis but the
environment or least natural selection knows that the environment is changing so what was good last generation will
not necessarily be good for the subsequent generation so it has to forget in the same way that you learn by
forgetting you have insights by dispensing with redundant information so
in a sense death for in that life cycle is an essential part of um uh of the
self- evidencing of the species so it may be bad for you I suppose you know in
a nesque sense in that it's denying the opportunity to be curious and engaged with the lived world but it's certainly
good for your children and your children's children right right right I'm a I'm a for warning for them that's
good I'm glad to I'm glad to be that porn in that game and a kind of cheery note on which to end um will be a
slightly morbid question Carl this was an absolute pleasure um despite the
occasional Wi-Fi hiccup I think it's um it's gone you know I've been I'm
incredibly happy with it thank you so much for being our first guest um and answering my sweet of sometimes bizarre
questions it was a real Joy on my part right well it was been a real pleasure
talking to you your questions were excellent I have no idea how long you're going to have to spend editing all this
I I thank you again for that opportunity to uh you know to talk about these wonderful issues and hopefully we'll do
