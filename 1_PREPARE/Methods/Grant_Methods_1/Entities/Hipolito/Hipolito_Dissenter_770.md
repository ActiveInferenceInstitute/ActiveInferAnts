Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Dissenter. I'm your host, as always, Ricardo Lopes, and today I'm joined by Dr. Inês Hipólito. She is a lecturer at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain at Humboldt University zu Berlin, where she investigates the reciprocal relationship between the representational structures, basic cognition and the nervous system. She is also an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent grad fellow at the University of Amsterdam where she studies the emergence of artificial intelligence as augmented cognition. And also just to mention that she is a co-founder and vice president of the International Society of the Philosophy of the Sciences of the Mind and she also serves as an elected member of the Women in Philosophy Committee and the Committee in Diversity and Inclusivity at the Australasian Association of Philosophy. So Dr. Hipólito, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to have you. Thank you so much. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you so much for inviting me.
Embodied and enactive cognitive science
Great. So okay, I would like to start by asking you about embodied and enactive cognitive science because I mean over the years on the channel I've been talking with a lot of psychologists, cognitive scientists and people who basically, generally speaking, do work on cognition. But embodied cognition I've covered it a few times on the show and enactivism not so much. So tell us first what this approach is and what it brings to the table in cognitive science. All right. Okay, so it's quite a diverse and rich framework. So it's hard to put it in short but I'll try at least to do some introduction that does some justice to it. So basically e-cognition or embodied and enactive and extended and ecological, etc. because there are more e's, comes up as a family of frameworks or of theories under framework that's better that aim to be alternatives to representationalism. So to old school representationalism in analytical philosophy of mind. So then within this family, as always, they usually agree upon certain claims but then they're going to diversify and nuance by virtue of specific ways or specific features in which they explain their own alternative to representationalism, right? So then you have embodied cognitive science which is highly influenced and inspired by for example phenomenology or pragmatism. So this is extremely rich precisely because it's got this very long and well-established tradition. And then you have for example ecological psychology which is also extremely rich and then we arrive at enactivism which some people might just call it enactivism but within even enactivism there are several variants or different accounts. The two major ones are the first one which is the one that has been set by Maturana and Varela so mostly inspired by biology, concept of autopoiesis as well as with or by Buddhist philosophy and then you have radical enactivism which is more fundamentally inspired in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and it's called radical in the sense that radical enactivism questions whether the other e's including in the other form of enactivism are going to sufficiently deliver the promise of being or serving as a solid alternative to representationalism. So this is in very very short but I'm happy to unpack further.
An enactive-dynamic model of cognition
Sure. And then when we have a dynamic model of cognition to it and then we have an enactivist dynamic model of cognition because that's something you also talk about in your work. So could you tell us about that first of all? What are dynamic processes and how do they differ from what we traditionally find as models in psychology for example? Okay, so models in psychology are fundamentally not different from models in any other science. So I usually start by that because it is important. Sometimes there is this tendency to think that models in psychology or models of the brain are somehow different or more special than the model of the weather, but they're not. Models are our best attempts, our best mathematical and computational attempts to understand a certain phenomenon that we would otherwise would not be able to as well as get some predictive power from it. So be able to predict future states of the system. So this is what the model is in throughout or across any scientific field and then we also do that in psychology and in neuroscience with computational neuroscience and in cognitive psychology. So I do not, or at least I think that I can say that e-cognition and myself included do not over emphasize the role of these models and that's where precisely this is extremely crucial to understand the difference between e-cognition and representationalism theories because what happened was in the 50s with the computer revolution, what happened was that all of a sudden psychology gained these important toolkit that allowed them to push back against behaviorism and say well we need to understand what are these hidden processes that we cannot see and behaviorism by explaining behavior cannot explain. So then the computer comes in with this toolkit with inputs outputs processes and all of the sort of conceptual machinery and it was useful at the time. The as things unfold for philosophy of mind there was a tendency to repeat the history of employing computational toolkits into the explanation of the mind right? So then we had Turing machine in the 50s so then we have Jerry Fodor employing well let's think about the mind as if it were a Turing machine right? So then you have the modularity of the mind but then this story repeats itself over and over until today. Then you have parallel distributed processing comes up as the new computational event that was quite important and revolutionary in computer science and then you think about okay so what if what if the mind is actually parallel distributed processing and then you have the beginning of connectionist theories of the mind and then the story repeats itself again now as we leave the Bayesian era right? So now we are thinking about okay so what if the mind is Bayesian predictive machine then you have all of these story coming all the way from Helmholtz until today and then you arrive at this computational models of the brain. So now you have to do some interesting you have some interesting philosophy to do here which pertains to whether these models are going to be ontological predictors of what the brain is or what the mind is or if the models are going to serve as these moments of learning so these tools that you employ and you develop you engage with as an opportunity for learning about the system that you are targeting the system of scientific interest right? So some people might say that models are ontology prescribers so that when I use a model to understand or to do some brain data analysis and I use this model with for example Bayesian tools then some people would as I sometimes say press the realism button to say that the brain is Bayesian so it's fundamentally ontologically Bayesian of the Bayesian kind so the processes cognitive processes in the brain are of the Bayesian kind and of course the 10 people working with other different models if they also press the realism button they're going to say exactly the same but with their own toolkit being what is the case in the brain. So then this I'm mentioning all of this so that I sort of like give a little bit of lay of the land of on how we arrive at then more complexity models and how they differ from this story that has been this very tight connection between computer science and philosophy of mind. It is almost unconceivable to think okay if sort of like thought experiment if it wasn't the case that we had computer science and we did have philosophy of mind as a discipline as a subject area without computer science what would would be our theories of the mind because what we have is the history of analytic philosophy of mind is so the traditional Western one is always employing and applying the best computational toolkit of their time and then we have a theory of mind. So complexity comes from a different angle so complexity instead of starting off with a premise that the brain or the mind is a computer which is the premise that has been permeating throughout times analytical philosophy of mind complexity starts with the observation of the natural world. So it doesn't solve the premise that the mind is a computer therefore let's see what kind of like system of thinking do we arrive at once we start off with that premise. So it starts with a premise that things in the world are of a certain kind and that kind is of a complex system. Why is it a complex system? Well it has certain different features that make it a complex system so for example it is an open system which means that is it is in this state of autonomous precariousness which means that the system on the one hand self-organizes to maintain itself but a condition to self-organize to maintain itself is that it interacts with the world that's what it means to be an open system that seemingly defies the second law of thermodynamics that stipulates that everything should tend to chaos or entropy and die. So we are magnificent because we actually defy this law and maintain ourselves a lot despite the odds set by the second law of thermodynamics. So we are these open systems. So that's what what I find interesting about complexity science as opposed to the mind machine metaphor permeating my thinking about mind is that you start off with the observation of the natural world and that the natural world is permeated by open systems is permeated by complex systems and then you can use a set of tools which is dynamical systems theory that allows you to model those complex systems which is also very interesting. But what is it that makes systems complex? What is this complexity coming from? Well intuitively one would say oh because they are quite difficult to understand that's rightly so but it is more than that is that in the very core of the definition of complexity is a very fundamental and very important understanding and insight which is that the the system is as more complex or the complexity goes up the more difficult it is for us to predict the future states of the system or put in other times complexity goes up the more difficult it is for us to model the behavior. So complexity intuitively one would say that is as it relates to how hard it is to understand the system and that's of course intuitively correct but more than that at the core of the term complexity it's a much more important insight that we should not lose sight from which is that complexity means that a system is hard to model so the complexity goes up rises up in proportion to our heart it is for us to model a system. Why is that? Because it has more degrees of freedom. So this is quite interesting because instead of simply making an analogy of the brain with the computer or of cognition slash mind with a computer and you mean that it is that all these inputs and these inputs and outputs and processes happening in the middle that we need to understand we are starting off with a very humble position where we understand that systems are quite complex and there is a range and diversity of complexity. So for example a complex system could be for example bacteria right and bacteria is less complex than for example human behavior so human behavior would be sitting on the very top or or one of the most conceivable complex systems would be human behavior and this is to arrive at your question about models in psychology. Models in psychology are models of any other kind except that the complexity is really high that's that's still bit for for now.
Thinking about psychological traits
Okay so let's try to unpack that a little bit. So first of all I would like to understand a little bit better if and how this would have implications for how we think about certain issues in psychology for example. So we usually tend to talk about people having traits and by that we mean usually fixed and immutable psychological traits I guess or immutable entities. So with that in mind with all of what you said in mind do you think it still makes sense to think about the traits? Well it makes sense to think about traits but not as innate. So that's exactly the package that one gets from the modularity of the mind which in its you I want to say that in its original formulation by Jerry Fodor and of course other others there are nativists think that or think of the mind as this computer there is hardwired from birth so then it is supposed to develop according to certain hardwired rules and it is supposed to function according to Southern hardwired rules and of course there's been like tons of pressure from coming from science and and philosophy upon the original formulation of these hardwired mechanisms extremely rigid informational encapsulated the main specific kinds of mechanisms which we can talk about. There's been tremendous pressure on that which has forced many people that are sort of sitting in the modularity side of it and the native side of it to reformulate and revise that kind of like theory into a more developmental and less evolutionary theory within psychology and of course we still have these two streams nativist nurture nature debate which comes all the way from Plato and Aristotle so we still have that. Now or the evil Devo now today in in psychology a lot of people indoors a mainstream so there are a lot of people indoors like this middle ground between the two. One hardly finds I think only apart from from a few people that have been actually under the target recently because of ChatGPT and large language models such as Stephen Pinker or Chomsky they are quite a nativist about about language. But what in the understanding coming from complexity science as opposed to the more computationalist approach it is quite true that computationalist approach tends to be a little bit more nativist even though it allows for development but by by saying that the system is supposed to develop in a certain way given certain conditions then that's the direction that the system is supposed to develop so it allows for some development but still has some nativist grounds. Complexity is quite different because in complexity applied to psychology there's no such thing of thinking of group level analysis for example. So it's not one recipe that will suit all the individuals for example struggling with general mental health conditions like autism like like autism or or anxiety or depression or any kind of though. So in complexity the there are many features that are quite relevant but I'm just going to mention this one for now which is that it has an individual approach it is tailorized to the individual so complexity when applied to treatment and understanding and developing or or coming up with with interventions mental health interventions or even well-being interventions for the society it looks at individual trajectory so if an individual is an individual trajectory which is quite different to the group level analysis on average kind of thing that is usually pursued by by cognitive psychology.
An enactivist account of culture
And what is the role that then culture plays here? What would be for example an enactivist account of culture? Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Dissenter. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lopes and today I'm joined by Dr. Inês Hipólito. She is a lecturer at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain at Humboldt University zu Berlin and I hope I pronounced it correctly where she investigates the reciprocal relationship between the representational structures basic cognition and the nervous system. She is also an Amsterdam Brain and Cognition Talent grad fellow at the University of Amsterdam where she studies the emergence of artificial intelligence as augmented cognition and also just to mention that she is a co-founder and vice president of the International Society of the Philosophy of the Sciences of the Mind and she also serves as an elected member of the Women in Philosophy Committee and the Committee in Diversity and Inclusivity at the Australasian Association of Philosophy. So Dr. Hipólito, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to have you. Thank you so much. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you so much for inviting me.

So this is in very very short but I'm happy to unpack further.

An enactivist account of culture
a a a close social cultural background
that might be problematic right and and so um how the social
cognition operates then through uh an inactive perspective and these theory of
Mind important here I mean important not important but necessary here or not
um yeah so you can you can um think about so again so what I said about
representationalism and how representationalism explains um culture and everything that we do is
is coming down to mental representations applies precisely to a theory of mind or
mind reading theories in social cognition and um what it states is that
um as living beings interact with one another um that interaction takes the form of
um mental representation so the ascription of mental States and what that means
um is that um each of the actors that is constructing
a social scene are ascribing
um a possibility that they think that the other person states that they think
that the other person is at so what this looks like to really go
down to the core of it what this looks like is
um as if um the these subjects had absolutely no
access to the scene and were spectators sitting looking at
the screen for example um and looking at the other person that is interacting with them
and wondering about what is going on making inferences I
think that this is the case I think that this is the case so it's always applying these models applying these mental
representation to make sense of what the other person is saying what we think
that theory of mind is missing is that in a in a social interaction it is not
um an offline kind of situation it is as
I've just said an interaction so that means it's being an interaction means
that it is co-constructed where parts are actors not Spectators so each part that is in
that interaction has a core responsibility to
build that interaction there are so many implications once you
pursue the theory of Mind there are so many ethical implications but I'm gonna cite that for now and I'm just gonna go
through the cognitive science of it so with theory of mind what you get is a
narrative or an explanation or an understanding of interaction between human beings as not interacting at all
but as being separated from each other making inferences and describing mental
objects like as almost like throwing mental objects at each other hoping that it is the case
so then again um now go to how um an activist or ecognition I would say
in general would reject that to say that however it can even be the case that we
don't understand or cannot understand yet a social cognition
truly yet but one thing that seems unreasonable is to think of
social actors co-constructing a scene with responsibility being described or
characterized as having no responsibility whatsoever as being Spectators and just showing
um mental representations hoping that that's the case so that sounds
unreasonable so what incognition theorists think is that of course in
social interaction there are going to be moments in which you are not really sure
what is going on you are confused and it's in those moments when you are
confused that you are going to to to to to employ and draw from inference skills
that you have learned to try to make sense of that thing that is being confused right now I'm a little confused
I'm not sure what you meant um I'm not sure what happened um there um why why did the person react
like that so these are the moments when you start theorizing but that does not necessarily mean that
in a social interaction where there are co-constructive there is a co-constructive social narrative to be
told there um look down to always hmm I wonder I
theorize maybe that's this there are so many meanings that are there
that are not explicitly told and it is way easier for me to pick out or for a
social actor to pick out on those meanings when the subjects interacting with each other share a common social
cultural background so I'll go back to the example of going to uh a different
culture culture that is quite different to the one that I've been mostly inculturated with or something like that
of course this is a rudimentary example but I think that it works for for this for this purpose
um so if I'm engaging in a social encounter in a social interaction within
a a culture that I'm not really um inculturated with I am going to be
missing out on many meetings and those are the meanings that are
there that are being shared that are being co-constructed reinforced so bias are being reinforced uh challenging of
bias can be can also come up within and taking place and generated within the
social interaction as opposed to the very spectator kind of sitting on the
couch wondering what is going on when what is going on is I am corresponsible
for what is going on right so let's get now into uh
artificial intelligence you also do work on that so how does inactivism apply to
artificial intelligence then well um it's quite interesting because
within ecognition um the theory that is mostly most lined
up to deal with that problem there has been since 98 um is the extended mind
um because it is precisely the theory that aims to explain how
technological devices gadgets are Incorporated to play a role in cognitive processes so
the extended mind would seem like the most suited to now deal with artificial
intelligence um well I dispute that
um and that's part of my work um at the moment is to precisely do theory development on
how um artificial intelligence just
um is just as much part of our enculturation as anything else is
so I dispute the extended mind and I am
trying to put forward um a different way in an activist way of understanding the permeation of AI into
our lives in every level but also how AI development and design
is our responsibility so one thing that there's there are
there I think of course I think that our many difficulties for the extended mind
that come to light even more so now as we develop AI systems
um the extended mind even though it is part of the it is under the umbrella of the
ease and it's been wrong for for for a long time and has done a very good job in um
sort of like moving away and disputing the idea that cognition reduces to the
brain at work so it has done that very good uh leveraging in cognitive science
and it's been quite quite important in that but it does sit on one of
um the sides of the spectrum that is the e-cognition family and that side of the
spectrum is the one that is neighboring representationalism um the extended mind is a
representationalist theory uh this is uh very clear uh from Andy
um so when it becomes Innovative is that it calls in the body to play a fundamental
role in cognition but the role that is played by the body is more representation less
um less charged with semantics less charged with with semantic content in in
a model then the brain but it is uh operated by via and guided through
action-oriented representations as anti-clark defensive and the whole system bring more the environment
or brain body and a gadget from the environment is an information processing
system so in that sense the extended mind is very much aligned with representationalism
so I dispute that um because um there are many reasons to do so but
one of the reasons being the quite obvious one which is reducing um mental life to uh mental representations
and uh then there is responsibility as well so the conceiving of this gadgets
as if they were things that show up in the environment and then we just sort of
like attach them and now they're part of um the cognitive processes
that sounds that sounds uh quite dangerous but but very useful for for
um uh Tech free markets because then that allows them to um sort
of like uh Overlook um regulations but that's a different kind of kind of side one thing that I
agree with the extended mind is that um these gadgets are going to play a
fundamental role in the shaping of cognition I do agree with that I just
don't agree that cognition comes down to mental representation and information processes but I do agree with that with
the Excel mind they do play but from a different angle so completely uh coming
from uh what I've what I've been saying about how cultural plays a role
um in in cognition it's because the cultural practices that we engage with
are going to shape our identity right and if you think now about
what are the cultural practices that we engage with well we engage with this all of these um ways of thinking
um rituals shared beliefs values all of these other cultural practices that are
completely and totally embodied in the ways that you move around the environment
now if you and go on and and become a scientist or a techno scientist
um or someone that is engaging with developing technology developing AI then
um that means that you are also engaging in a cultural practice so the
development the design of these AI gadgets is a cultural practice it is go
why is it a cultural practice and and AI or technology is not just things that
show up because of some reason it's because we as a community we as a social
cultural Community Define again in a very implicit manner
but the fine the problems that we ought to solve as a community the problems
that are relevant to this particular Community to be solved so that's already in itself a cultural practice
so you have a very very simple example that we all have lived in the last three
years so the the MRNA technology has been around since the 80s
and yet it took a pandemic to kick off start that technology to a
complete different level well where not only we were able to now deal with
coronavirus but also we found some um other applications for it in in in in
different in many other different diseases so technology is highly cultural
so technology is not something that shows up in the air and nobody really knows no it's something that is
completely and totally motivated and driven by the Necessities the the the
the needs of a social cultural setting and in that case it was a global
one but what I what I mean is that technology is not just something that is
available and we attach to our own um cognitive processes such as
um so so technology is not something that um shows up and then it's available to
for people to use and then it plays a role into cognitive processes no we are very much responsibility is responsible
as a community um too um or or for the kinds of technologies
that are going to um that we're going to give rise uh through uh through our
social cultural practices in technoscience so that's one way in which
um technology AI um it comes and is completely shaped by
social cultural practices and then you have the other side and then you flip things around and you ask so the first
question was how what is the form or the shape of
um the emergence of technology and AI so that's one well it's cultural now that's
what that would be that's my theory and then you can ask the flip side of the question what is the influence or the
impact of that emergence into human identity and by human identity I
mean people's individuality is being shaped by the availability of certain
technology digital worlds and AI smart environments but also defining us as a
human species so I think that there are these two
sides that are quite relevant to address that I don't think that a representationalist theory of it can
address whatsoever and I'm not even expanding on
um the ethical side of it right but at a certain point you
mentioned there techno science principles and I would like to ask you a very specific question about that
because I know you're also interested in this subject so I read about AI in your
work I read about feminist techno science principles so could you tell us
about that and if we could use AI or human robot interactions more
specifically to subvert gender norms yes
um so I first I must preface this by saying that I'm not a feminist
technoscientist specialist um maybe I hope I will be one day but I
am not um but there are some concerns
that come um rightly so from this literature that
are very relevant um to the cognitive science of AI and
these concerns are not new so to speak because these are concerns that come
from from feminists feminist epistemology of science uh about science
so this comes from a standpoint Theory um which basically uh in very very
simple terms is the view that if models of the natural world are representative
of uh main narrative usually uh male
dominated narrative then do we really have uh encompassing uh model of the
natural world if they do not include um uh diverse perspectives and this of
course has tremendous ramifications in science such that such as many studies
being made by using mostly male subjects which then of course are not going to
translate into other groups needs so they're not speaking to or not
solving problems in other groups needs so that's a problem in science
um so there is also these positivist kind of
influence in trying to separate separate science from techno science sorry
science from technology so it's a very positive way of thinking things and
thinking that science is this Holy Grail that needs to have these standards for
objectivity and and the technicality of it is it's not as relevant it's
important but it's not as relevant so some people tend to avoid the term technoscience by virtue of endorsing
this scientism about science um and what in general feminist Theory
uh wants to say and identifies in many different ways
um is that both of them Science and Technology are
practices our social cultural practices um so
um we might or would like to have these ideal way of proceeding in science
such as um believing or wanting to believe that
one can be put in an objective perspective and that we won't allow any
of our prior views biases to interfere with our scientific work one would like
to think that that is the case or one would like to think that that is possible but that is not possible because
um the practice of science is not encapsulated the scientist is situated in an
epistemic community and whether we want it or not whether we
want to deny it or not whether we talk we thought about it or not in popper Carl popper was very clear about that
whether we have done our scientists as a scientist in the epistemic community
whether one has done the philosophical critical analysis of the methods and
theories that one is engaging with or not we are engaging with certain philosophical assumptions and we certain
and we are using and employing certain biases that come from not only our more
broader social cultural environment are you in the west are you in the East but
also with the specific epistemic community that one is part of I give you
a very very practical example um if one is it a certain particular
country or at a certain particular University even even within a university
there are mainstream ways of doing things and there are more alternative ways of doing things right and then you
are going to find yourself in one of them right and then the question is are
you reinforcing a certain epistemic communities system of views or thinking
or belief system of beliefs or are you challenging but whether or not you do this meta
level work of critically analyzing your position or where you are where you sit
within um this embeddedness of social cultural embeddedness that's not what we are
talking about what we are saying is that you are embedded right so denying that is naive and
counterproductive so a better a better position is to endorse and understand
that you are embedded so now let's map out my position let me critically
analyze where I am and what is it that I am doing as opposed to going with the flow so to
speak so that's what feminist um Theory brings out is this raising
this awareness that when you are engaging with scientific practices you are within you are engaging in a
cultural practice meaning that you are not encapsulated from the rest of the world doing or thinking like a machine
in a very objective way no everything is going to be fully permeated by the
culture and the epistemic community that you are part of so you must be aware such that you can do the work of
um at least trying not to trying to be fair inclusive not to
commit uh biases now how does this translate because this I was speaking to science because I wanted to sort of like
shed some light on how that goes in science now turning this to Ai and Technology things that get even more out
of control because science usually happens and occurs typically not always within the
gates of Academia and there are advantages and disadvantages of that but that's for another another time
um in technology technology is being developed mostly and a lot of it at
least in outside of the gates of Academia in companies that have a lot of money uh to develop
on technology now imagine a world where um
a lot of people are um in these companies developing designing the future Society or the
future of society um and without having awareness that
they are fully social culturally influenced that
around the world what happens is then that and this is the future if you don't
have that awareness what happens is what is happening now around the world you
have infinite lines of code that are coming
out as we speak continuously that might
very well be there's a high likelihood that they are fully and totally biased
for many reasons lack of awareness lack of critical thinking
and the vast majority of a male dominant narrative
and this is happening in both Fields so
so it's a you know full circle close that thought um that happens in science when you
develop scientific you develop scientific uh solutions for problems
that are very dear to a certain dominant narrative
as opposed to channeling resources that are going to also solve problems to the
representative society that we have and in technology the same applies
mm-hmm so but I mean the other part of my question here was so can we use that
with the intent if people have that intent of course of subverting or at
least rethinking gender norms for example we need to educate ourselves so and
still that is just one step because it is very
um it is quite clear from psychology studies that are in many many ways there
is a tension or a contradiction between what One Believes and what one does
right so that's cognitive dissonance um I might believe that something is
really good for me but I don't engage in a practice that would get me there or I might believe that something is bad for
me but I don't engage in the practice of you know uh quitting a certain habit or practice let's go into descendants and
this at the very same happens in these particular fields so you might be very well aware that you
must be inclusive you must be diverse um there are certain ways of being and
doing things that are much more preferable as opposed to others and you
might be under that belief intellectually speaking and if somebody asks you you give the right answers to
it right because you took a moment to think and then you're gonna give the right answers or the the most reasonable
ones and there are certain social cultural setting and that it may be the case that in your
actions you are not going to embody those beliefs
it is very possible so that's why one must start with raising awareness and
education right that must start there and I can I can speak a bit about that because I've also developed that a
little bit in in in a couple of papers um so for example
so imagine that scenario that I was describing which is around the world you have a multi-millionaire uh tech
companies developing the the future of the society Tech wise right
so all of those people had to be educated with um technical skills to
precisely do that so one thing that is quite important is that AI programs in the universities
from bachelor's Masters phds have a quite fundamental and mandatory component of
um philosophy of AI for example such that we can think together all of these issues as we
together shape the new Society a society that is in in is ever more mixed reality
as we go in and out of online offline all the time right and full and and ever
more permeated by smart environments um you know and Technologies so it is
quite important that we are educating those that are going to be coding the
future of the society in a way that they are at least aware of the fundamental
problems that come with the responsibility of building a future Society
so education I think is part of the answer
but being also fully aware of cognitive dissonance but it is the beginning and then we need
to have something else that sort of like tries to
um uh balance out some issues that might come up with uh cognitive dissonance or
even Market pressures which is regulation
that idea of free markets in technology needs to stop because
um it is quite interesting it's it's it's there's still very much free market where you can develop any kind of
technology and make it available and that actually interestingly comes um from uh debate in
um flow Swift technology which is also a very rich field and the debate is between the neutrality of technology and
social technology so some people would argue that technology in itself the
gadgets are neutral right what makes it ethical or moral or what charges it with
ethical or moral value is how people use it and then you have on the other side others like me saying that technology
and science are profoundly shaped by culture there are cultural practices
right they are born of those social culture practices it's not just only
when you use it or people decide to use it you know we have a responsibility to begin with
the neutrality is that view that guns don't kill people people kill people
so that's the principle of free market let's make it all available and put the responsibility upon their users so
that's why I said that education on the one hand is one part of it because we
need to educate the future people that are building and have the responsibility of building the society but on the other
hand we need regulation such that cognitive dissonance and Market pressures
um do not pass by great so
um okay so perhaps this is a good point to get into a question that dear Patron
sent me because we're talking here about Ai and how it met might impact society
and our cognition so uh I've got a question here from Eduardo Castro and he
says may you please ask doctor inezipoli to how the she predicts AI will impact
our recognition processes in the future and how our personalities May evolve
into that reality also considering the complexity of the human brain may she
elaborate more on the topic of AI as augmented cognition and how that Synergy
between brain and AI may work yes um that's a brilliant question I'm
very happy um with with answering it uh because it allows me to now speak towards the
positive side because it seems that I've been a bit negative but with everything there's always um uh we need to strike
that balance um and part of my research at University of Amsterdam was precisely to think about how positively and
negatively Ai and Technology impacts and shapes our lives and of course there are
many negatives negatives to it which come from what I've been speaking about
um but I do believe that if with with education
um with us educating ourselves um to upgrading
um into a better standpoint a standing point that is much more inclusive and
and ethical and aware if we upgrade ourselves into that position then we can
do tremendous things with technology and AI
um the possibilities are extremely vast and specifically to a more fragile or
less dominant narrative groups in the society that have less
um opportunities or that are struggling more in our society so One Sweep attain
that particular standpoint of how can we develop technology that is going to be
useful um for Equity purposes in a society then we are doing something that is very
interesting so um one of the things that I am working on
um well you mentioned one of them which is um this paper that we have just finished
which is going to actually a special issue that is um on women in robotics
um there's a lot to say there as well but that that paper is going there which is about gender Norms in human robot
interaction and there of course we have a few examples of where the problem whether
coded bias lies uh how smart assistants
are usually feminized so as being having very feminine features right so that is
uh quite um not all right um so but there's that tendency and this
of course stems from the problems that we've been discussing so the coded buyers the majority of one group of one
social group coding and envisioning the future right so imagine that you have a future
world right there is the world as you know it is extremely diverse with so
many different cultures with so many different perspectives and point of views and it's so rich and vast and
amazing and now imagine that you select one group doesn't matter one group to
Envision the future of them all that is quite not all right um so women of course are not going to
be very happy with the fact that typically as it has been does till now
typically speaking smart assistants are um have feminine features
so that's something there that is the human robot interaction intervention
that we need to do some work and there are some very good people my co-authors
are amazing uh doing uh work on that especially in Scandinavia on precisely
working out the reversing of the damage that has been done in that field on
human robot interaction especially especially in that case come becomes specially relevant because it is one of
the cases where we have this kind of technology that is quite available to
someone living in a developed country with with with certain resources which
is having like interacting with a phone that has a smart assistant and of course these things are becoming ever more
upgraded but this is something that people tend to have some access to so imagine the impact that that is doing is
just reinforcing a certain bias towards gender Norms so this is a clear exam example or on where coding and
developing AI is a cultural practice it's reinforcing a cultural practice so
there's work to be done that to reverse that so that's one example and of course there are many other human robot
interactions uh that we need to be aware of on um what kind of world we want in
the future do we want to reinforce something or do we want to break it up so that's where I think that there's the
power of technology and AI is to break up with things that are not good to
Define us as a human species where we want to be in the future how do we want to be seen how do we want to be defined
do we want to be defined as an inclusive um species uh with with the certain
values or or not so okay so perhaps this will be my last
The need for cognitive and cultural diversity in science
question then because I'm also getting mindful of your time so uh earlier you
mentioned something very interested when I very interesting when I asked you about
technology and feminist principles uh you commented a little bit on science as
an institution how it's practiced so and with diversity in mind do you think then
that the in the practice of science the diversity we should have in mind mostly
would be cognitive and cultural diversity because I I mean I've spoken to people like
cultural psychologists for example and they talk about how people
uh all people are different in terms of their cognition in terms of their perception for example holistic versus
analytic thinking just to give a quick example so is that uh the one or at
least one of the kinds of diversity that you think would be important to have in science that is cognitive and cultural
diversity well absolutely absolutely because if you start off with a premise where I
start without cognition is permeates everything that you are so defines your
individuality defines your identity right then it's going to Define it not only at the very basic levels of basic
cognition as I mentioned which is what sets me aside from representationalism but also your ways of thinking right
which would be the cognitive size aspect I think that you are referring to so that is extremely relevant so whether
you're going to be more talented more natural more inclinated to something some kinds of ways of thinking it's
quite important to have cognitive diversity of course it is then extremely important
to have cultural diversity because of this other aspect that I mentioned before which is the problems that are
going to come up as problems that want that scream out for solutions they are
dependent on a culture right so then you want to have a lab that is
representative of a society right such that the problems that would come up
within different cultures as special and important to solve within different cultures have a voice
right so they are not in a void just all of us pretending that there is a dominant narrative that will suit them
all so it is of course extremely important to have cognitive and cultural
diversity within our labs and developing our science developing our our philosophy and then it's also very
important to have diversity in our classrooms because one thing that I noticed as I
interact with my students and then I talk about this with my my staff
colleagues in the department um is that um female students tend to be less
confident so they approach you with less confidence they tend to graduate in in
in in in less numbers um because it they lack this kind of
like confidence that for example their counterparts um uh men in classroom tend to speak up
way more um raise their hands way more so then we think we need to think about what are
the strategies that we need to implement in our classrooms in University in order to stimulate
um and overcome those confidence problems now imagine that you have uh stuff
um that uh in a department that is majority uh male that is majority men
um that that has been part of the problem is that once you ask a child to
draw a scientist it would be likely that the child would would draw a man or a
flaws first same thing so representative also in classrooms it's also really important so rep representative in in
Labs philosophy and classrooms are quite relevant the other thing that is also
really important so it does not stop there there because otherwise you would be gatekeeping
um it does not stop there there's another dimension that is important to mention which is that in doing this
research and putting these ideas out there Etc there's another dimension which is science communication the
scientific world needs to stop gatekeeping it needs to speak to the society so what do I mean by that at the
end of the day scientists and philosophers need to ask if the work is having any societal impact because if at
the end of the day you're just writing papers publishing papers and patting yourself on the back that you did a great job but nobody in but it doesn't
change anything in the society doesn't have societal impact then it's going to be really slow so it is important that
we do these kinds of things that we are doing here podcasts science communication that we break down the
science or the philosophy and make it available of these thinkings and thoughts available to the society
everywhere this is extremely important and another thing is to have an open science kind of concept make all the
data available to everyone to have access to as opposed to gatekeeping so it's important that when we write grants
and we do the research that we always have in mind these societal impact how
you can this research and these public funds benefit the society as soon as
possible so that's the other side of it I think great so on that note Dr repolito where
