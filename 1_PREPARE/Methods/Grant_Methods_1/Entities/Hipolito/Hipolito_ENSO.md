https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xd3oEr66xI





hello and welcome to the June 2023 Enzo seminar
um I'm delighted to be joined for our final session of the the 2223 series
about uh by uh Dr inesh ipolito from well in a matter of stable State between
uh two different affiliations at the um the the Humboldt university the the center for mind and brain in Berlin and
also Macquarie University in um in Sydney so uh very welcome for our
uh for this session you know thank you so much it is my pleasure to
be here especially in the grand finale of the Season thank you so much for having me well thanks a million for
joining us and for for sharing your work um of which there is a um a great deal
as of late um as we noted so um your work is sort of delightfully
interdisciplinary and sort of the the kind of the in the the best tradition of
interdisciplinary cognitive science and so you background you completed your your doctoral studies in uh Wollongong
is that right and then uh moved to postdoctoral work at the the minor brain Institute before heading back to
Australia as you will do in the next few weeks so you're a lecturer in philosophy of AI at uh Macquarie and you
um so to to all of our viewers then um initiative work focuses on cognition
and artificial intelligence uh combining theories from all of the ease in cognitive science we're not picky
batteries we keep them going um whether we've I don't know how many we've got at this point it all it
started with four but um there's a there's quite a bit of swapping around there yeah exactly and also the uh so
complexity science as you'll be talking a bit about today as well um so yeah is an ethicist of AI
and also a copy of the project on designing Urban density neural urbanism
as a novel approach in global health and that's at the the Berlin University Alliance um you know it keeps very very busy
indeed um she's a co-founder and vice president of the international Society for the philosophy of the Sciences of
mind which has its inaugural hybrid conference coming up towards the end of the year is that right yes absolutely
December yeah and uh and it's also because um you know clearly not doing enough has
a podcast in the works and on the way um the in fact the Philosopher's way is on the way
um and that'll be one to keep an eye out for so in essopology.com is where you'll
find links to all of this information and um indeed you will be able to sort of track links for the podcast and so on
for for it to show up there in the future so um without further Ado I guess we might
sort of move to um looking at some of the the work we'll be talking about during the seminar also
um just as we wait for people to join us live via the stream so we have a few
viewers in um and we might have sort of more coming in in a few minutes we'd like to take a little time to um pause for a bit of uh
pause for a moment just as we start and get straight into what we sometimes call our commercial break
um so we have a few things to celebrate into just and flag as as worthy of
notice and coming up and recently out on this front in it yes I do um I'm going to just share my
screen so that I can share a few things that I'm quite excited about that I've been um coming out
um just the last couple of weeks and um and yeah so
um this is absolutely Shameless advertising uh but I think
but I am very excited about all of these works and collaborations uh so I'll just
mention them in case anybody else is also interested in these kind of topics so there's this commentary that I've
written for um as a commentary to you Susan Schneider's artificial you and this is a special issue that is uh being
published in the philosophy of east and west journal and it will be coming out
in the issue of April 2024 but the blueprint is already out there if anybody is interested it's the
human roots of artificial intelligence um so that'll be one of the papers it's
a very short one but where I'm already launching some of the ideas that I'm already working on to expand uh in the
future then this is also this very um recent paper as uh three days old I think
something like that which comes from um sort of a Consortium team at uh at
verses um and here we are tackling um one of the most important problems of
contemporary artificial intelligence um or even the global global scale
artificial intelligence and here we are trying to address the problem of the is
what is is called explainable Ai and how neural networks make decisions and how
can we make these decisions a little bit more transparent such as to avoid and
diminish biases in decision making in AI so this is a paper that we try to offer
some some directions in how we can do that by employing active inference
then um another one is also also out as you
see just very recently uh one week ago or something like that which is a paper that I'm very um happy with because I
have a tremendous opportunity to collaborate with Katie Finkel and
miretta Lee and they are absolutely extraordinary super talented
um researchers um Katie works with robotics in
Scandinavia and Mareta Lee works with feminist technoscience and I'm very
privileged and and feel very honored to have had the opportunity to work with collaborate with them in this paper
where we intend to share some thoughts um and some ideas on the the design
development and implementation of AI specifically focusing on human robot
interaction and looking at some cases where there are some there is some propagation and reinforcement of uh
their norms and we give some ideas or offer some ideas as to how to subvert these gender Norms as we design develop
and Implement human robot interaction situations and then uh there's also this paper
which uh just came out last night uh so I thought I was very excited about
sharing it with you this paper is about um employing the free energy principle
in order to understand um the coupling between the human species and the Earth and specifically
to address the climate crisis that uh that of course that we have and how can
we understand it especially when it comes to the human species or from the
human species point of view relation or attitude towards the the climate crisis
and how can we better understand it and also we offer some ideas on how to address it
and that's it those are the papers I was happy to share with you
thank you thank you very much for that so there is uh you keep us busy just reading Lolo knows how you have time to
get through all the writing of it but it's it's a fantastic series of papers so it's brilliant to see this kind of
work um pouring out and the the um you know the importance of it that you
know the Practical efficacy and the kinds of problems that were um you're you're dealing with in in
those in those works it's great yeah I think I'm ever more um more um motivated to asking that
question about uh how what is the societal impact of my work as in I don't
want to publish papers and just leave them in the journals and have no societal impact in the gates of Academia
so I've become very motivated to make those real world connections and
especially coming from an activism I think it's very much possible and it's very much doable and it's even even
makes an activism even more inactive I fully agree so I guess
um speaking of an activism I we're probably on time now to move to the the
presentation part of the seminar so I will invite you in it to
um give the the June 2023 and so seminar
Cognitive Modelling
thank you so much um so I will just start
um so the topic that I'm going to talk about today is mainly about cognitive model modeling
and invite us to think about what cognitive modeling is there are many
things that I find EX how many philosophical questions that I find extremely interesting and worth pursuing when it comes to cognitive modeling
um and I am going today to focus mostly on the technical part of it and on the
scientific practice part of it but there are other questions that I'm not going to bring up
um today uh that um that I think this is a very important philosophical topic
that needs to be addressed and discussed what I want to explore today is
specifically to look at cognitive modeling as an analogy with
um with a language game The Language game that we can sign tells us about so
cognitive modeling is a situated cultural practice so that's what I'm
gonna try to show you or at least give you some pointers on how we can think of
cognitive model like that and if we do that then if that will have any sort of
implications to the ways that we deal with think or employ cognitive modeling
Within the interdisciplinarity of cognitive science to understand the mind
and brain okay so
um I will start by defining what computation is and because I've already
I've already disclosed that I'm going to be gearing towards um situated cultural practices and vegan
science philosophy um computation is or I want to argue that competition is something that
humans do and this comes all the way from the Abacus so when we use tools to
compute or calculating using our fingers or using a calculator that we have
developed or even When developing sophisticated computers as well as of
course computational models where we find our cognitive modeling techniques and this
is so much so that you can see this picture right here which is the very famous picture of the woman of NASA the
woman that were called human computers and they were the ones that calculated all of those very difficult
sophisticated mathematics automatical equations that helped the human species
to go into orbit so they were the human computers and that's the idea that I
want to pursue um but I'm first going to formulate the problem so the problem
um takes the shape of weather computer or computation is independent of human
practices as I said a highly sophisticated form of computation
Computational Modelling
and it allows us for one to simulate or test a theory or a hypothesis especially
when we cannot set up an experimental setting or an experimental design to
test some Theory also my hypothesis so then what we can do is design and
develop a computer simulation in order to help us understand a particular test
a particular Theory or hypothesis things that the computational modeling allows us to do is to understand and
predict Behavior so once we have tested the theory on hypothesis we can refine our models and this can help us
understand the phenomenon and also hopefully as well predict a certain
behavior of that particular system so we do this Across The Sciences we do
this in Engineering in economics in social sciences in artificial intelligence and Neuroscience in all
across Sciences we use computational models in order to test our theories and hypotheses all the way from uh testing
theories about about black holes until testing theories about cells or even the
brain um some of the other things that we we use is for example when we want to build
a new bridge we come up with a model such as to test or to understand how to better build the the bridge
itself or we want to predict the weather we also can develop models that allow us
to precisely predict weather or even social networks in social sciences it's
also another real world problem or phenomenon that we want to understand so
then we develop and design these models that allow us to simulate for testing or
understand and predict Behavior so here is a different graph in order to
um sort of like put things together where they they happen um we have a natural world which is
um uh permeated by um different uh phenomena and in
scientific practices what we do is we Define a certain phenomenon that we are
interested in studying and then we can develop our best most sophisticated
mathematics to allow us and help us develop computational models such that
we can understand or predict a certain phenomenon of our scientific interests I
want to stress that this scientific models occur within the space of the
natural world and within the space of social cultural practices and that's where I'm going to put some emphasis um
in this talk or what I want to bring out as such um in in this talk
um in very very simple terms the idea is that scientific practices of developing
computational models is not isolated activity that is encapsulated from the
natural world or the social cultural practices that it that is encapsulated from The Real World it is within the
world that we develop these scientific models so in a way you cannot step outside of
the natural world where the phenomenons are what the phenomena is in order to
um conduct the scientific practice it takes place within that world
The Target System
um so it is the case as I just referred to that Across The Sciences we use
computational models to understand or predict a certain phenomenon from black
holes to cells but the problem um that I want to bring
up today first think about is that in cognitive science and particularly when
employing cognitive modeling a specific phenomenon happens it's quite peculiar
because uh this phenomenon does not happen in other sciences and that is
that the target system under investigation say cognitive processes
say the brain is thoughts too or in many in much of the literature it is
articulated as possessing the ontological properties of the model of
the computational model itself and what this means is that the target system is
seen as being literally computational and these links to the question that
motivates these this work here which is does computation exist outside of the
computational model that's the question that I'm trying to to stay with and think about because in cognitive science
these very peculiar phenomenon happen where we assume that the target system
in no other science we do that when we employ a computational model all in cognitive science we assume that the
target system has the properties of the computational model that is the target
system such as the brain or cognitive processes is computational there is
computation regardless of a scientific modeling taking place so that's quite
interesting so the idea is that computers must be found independently of scientific
practice in the natural living world because when we think about it and we stay with the problem we can see that
the implications of saying that cognition is computational then the the
implication of that statement is that computers computation must be found in
the natural living world regardless and independently of scientific practice of developing computational models so I
want to put pressure on that I want to claim that cognitive modeling as a form of computation as something
Cognitive Modelling as a Form of Computation
that we do requires human inculturated skills
so and I want to claim that by virtue of following the following argument
competition I um I I postulate computation requires
human inculturated skills cognitive model modeling is a form of
computation and therefore my claim is that cognitive modeling as a form of
computation requires human inculturated skills so bear with me
um and let's see if I'm making any sense this um I'm gonna just share this with you was just coming up on Twitter this
morning um there was this sharing of this tweets and I thought it was exactly in line
with what I was going to say today so I thought I'm just going to bring this up and also give credits to this person who
was very much in line um I just captured uh his idea there
where he says the only thing you're showing by comparing computation in this
case machine learning to how human think humans think is your ignorance of both
computer science and biology and I thought this was very much in line with the argument that I'm trying to
formulate here so um the idea about
The Mind Machine Metaphor
um postulating computation um in living systems such as in cells or
in neurons or in brains um is of course has been around for a
long time and of course all of us in Western philosophy of Mind are very much
pointed with the mind machine metaphor since Aristotle and of course all the way up to elmholds today
um this um this mind machine metaphor allowed some progress back in the day
because For the First Time it allowed a conceptual toolkit that that cognitive
psychology desperately needed to push back against behaviorism because behaviorism in itself was also not very
suitable or for progressing in understanding um cognition and the mind so then at the
time the conceptual toolkit that was allowed by the mind machine metaphor or especially arriving from Turing machines
allowed precisely to refer and enable the scientific practice to understand
and refer to mind and cognition so it allowed that conceptual toolkit that we
didn't have before like inputs outputs processes computations so it allowed us
to refer to or to try to address the Black Box problem that was arising from
behaviorism so then uh within the mind machine metaphor
um sort of like framework or or way of thinking then a few
um theories and Frameworks arise we see for example rule-based models where we
can find for example the modularity of the mind or connectionist inspired theories or neural networks or
mechanisms we theorizing rule-based models or theories of the mind that very
much developed and have been some have been quite useful in understanding
um neural neural Dynamics and activity then we also find the Bayesian models
where we find for example predictive coding which showed up mostly in 99 by
Raul and Ballard and then we have predictive processing as well as active inference
and we see that on this mind machine metaphor can be taken uh quite literally in some approaches within this
particular Frameworks we see for example Jacob Hui uh who is very clear in his
self-evidencing brain that the mind is a statistical inference machine and it's
curious because in this paper um he even clearly states that you can throw away the body the world and other
people so it's quite Machinery um the mind in prediction error
minimization um as thought of by Jacob Hui but there's also more um realist or at
least explicit realist accounts of for example the Bayesian models for example Michael reskora
um he defends a realist perspective on the Bayesian cognitive science and here
um uh roughly the argument in for example this paper is that if
computational modeling is a good predictor then the target system is
committed to the properties outline outlined by the cognitive modeling or the cognitive model so it is um the
condition for um for the mind to have the ontological properties of the model is that the
model is a good predictor so there'll be the the condition for the mind to
possess literally the the properties of the computational model and of course in
this particular paper what Michael tells us is that if patient cognitive science is so successful as a predictor then it
must be the case that we have a Bayesian brain so it's more or less
um uh where we are in this particular kind of framework that is motivated by
the mind machine metaphor and then uh we have um some questions that come up out of
this particular framework that some people have started thinking about is
the question that whether of whether computers can really be found
independently of scientific practice in cognitive system so the idea is is there
a computer is there really a competition that is independent of scientific practice
or is it a metaphor because indeed we talk about the mind machine metaphor and
this mind machine metaphor is really important because as George lockhoff and
Mark Johnson have uh very um nicely put in their book metaphors are extremely
important for the development and the leveraging and the motivating of scientific practices because
um they shape scientific progress by pointing out research directions that
are worth pursuing so that's the idea we are not we don't have um the energy the capacity or the funding to pursue in
very real world um thinking about the investigation that we do in cognitive science and
Neuroscience we do not have the energy or the funding to pursue all of them possible ways of thinking to understand
the mind and brain so then metaphors are quite useful because they help us uh
leveraging our thinking and pointing some directions that are worth pursuing
so then uh what seems to be the case in Western philosophy of mine is that many
theories have pursued the mind machine metaphor as opposed to other potential
metaphors and this is important for us to think about and in philosophy of mind
to ask the question why is that the case is it the case that the mind machine
metaphor is the most suitable most useful one is that why we are not really
in the mainstream Western philosophy of mind at least we are not pursuing or
exploring other metaphors is there a particular reason or is there a scientific evidence that that would put
us into that direction as opposed to exploring other directions
as a metaphor um the question then comes to in order to to assess
um the directions that we are taking so take stick a stop take a stock into what
we are doing and where we are taking um the cognitive science take responsibility for it and ask these
questions about as a metaphor is this metaphor the mind machine metaphor is it
useful is it the most suitable metaphor it's important for us to stop and think
about that one paper that has made two very good points I think
um is this paper by uh van held and what might cognition be if not computation
and um in here one help makes these uh two uh interesting points and I think
relevant points there are at least two reasons why the second question is important which is the question of why
um the mind machine metaphor first arguments in favor of some growth
hypotheses are rarely if ever completely General they tend to be arguments not for a
alone but rather for a favor a as opposed to B so argument's not four a
particular way of thinking such as the machine metaphor but rather in favor of
a as opposed to B and this worked um well or somewhat worked in back when we
had this distinction between or these two Frameworks the behaviorism and
cognitivism uh back in the day so it was this very limited or binary
um lacking Nuance way of thinking where it's either a or b behaviorism or
cognitivism and that's why usually the arguments for the mind machine metaphor
tends to have that flavor of a as opposed to B but is that a false
dichotomy so that's I'll just leave that open the second reason we need to ask
what alternative said maybe is that one of the most influential arguments in
favor of computational views is the claim that there is simply no alternative
and precisely here this is um sometimes known as what else could it be
argument and this has been uh formulated in in many places but here Alan Newell
puts it as such although a small chance exists that we will see a new paradigm emerge for mind
it seems unlikely to me basically there do not seem to be any
viable alternatives this position is not surprising in lots
of Sciences we end up where there are no main Alternatives around to the
particular theories we have then all the interesting kinds of scientific action occur inside the major
view it seems to me that we are getting rather close to that situation with
respect to the computational theory of mine so this particular second problem
that is identified by phone health is precisely the there's simply there is no alternative
Rodney Brooks
others um have also reinforced um some criticism about the no
alternative kind of problem to the mind machine metaphor
and this is some this is in in Rodney Brooks's words this is the it says that
this view is so ingrained in computational cognitive Neuroscience that one would seem mad to question it
some might say because computation makes us blind so that's a Rodney Brooks and then
Francis Egan tells us despite the fact that there is no widely accepted
naturalistic foundation for representational Content computational theorists persist in employing
representational language in articulating their models
Representations
further so not only do we have these problems identified in robotics by
Rodney Brooks but also by in Philosophy by Frankie Egan and
um also in Neuroscience so this particular case I I find it as a as
quite elucidating of the finding of representations or the modular or the
the mind machine metaphor of being particularly problematic in a very
explicit way and in this paper by Walter Freeman and Christine skarda representations who needs them they tell
us and I thought it would be worth for us to read them to read this passage
that is in the paper for more than 10 years we try to say
that each spatial pattern was like a snapshot that each burst served to
represent the odorant with which we correlated it and that the pattern was
like a search image that served to symbolize the presence or absence of
deodorant that the system was looking for but such interpretations were
misleading they encouraged us to view neural activity as a function of the features
and causal impact of stimuli on the organism and to look for a reflection of
the environment within my correlating features of the stimuli with neural
activity this was a mistake after years of sifting through our data
we identify the problem it was the concept of representation
so here they do identify in their studies of odorants they they to identify problems with having the mind
machine metaphor as a metaphor setting a direction to
um the the investigation or research on neural activity and in this particular
case was of the of odorants so then it seems that
Alternatives
um maybe there are no Alternatives and that can be due to many reasons
um but if that would be that could very well be the case but that is actually not the
case and I want to turn now our attention to that that could very well be the case but it is not the case there
are alternatives there are other metaphors the question then for us to think about is whether these other
metaphors are going to be more suitable or not to the mind machine metaphor but
this in itself is already a challenge for the there's simply there is no
alternative arguments um to the mind machine metaphor
okay so for example um one possible potential
Oscillators
um alternative metaphor not the only one but one possible alternative metaphor is
to think about uh living systems in the natural world as oscillators for example
the brain or cells and oscillators are for example pendulums swings flapping of
wings string musical instruments the beating of the heart electronic circuits
all of those or all of those systems that generate electrical signals all of
these are systems or objects that we have and find in the natural world
that displays some kind of oscillating Behavior and they are physical systems or devices
that exhibit more precisely periodic or rhythmic Behavior and they produce a
signal or a waveform that oscillates around a certain point or frequency typically in a repetitive manner it is
quite useful because then when we are to study these systems what we are looking for is patterns of behavior and that's
where we start building our scientific models so then
Computer vs Oscillator
um there are other metaphors but for for for today I'm just going to do a comparison comparison between a computer
and an oscillator because as I did say before um then the question comes to is the
Mind computer metaphor the most suitable if we have already established that there are other metaphors then the
question comes is the mind machine metaphor the most suitable so then in comparison between the Mind Computing
the metaphor so the computer mind and an oscillator we can find at least three
categories where we can which we can use to adjudicate so in terms of the kind of system the
computer is a human made system and the oscillator is a natural physical phenomenon in terms of complexity the
computer has somewhat limited complexity and the oscillator displays complex Behavior
the computer in terms of non-linearity uses typically linear logic and binary
States and the oscillator has small changes in the initial initial
conditions will lead to large changes over time so in this particular regard
of this is not an exhaustive list um this is just a a very superficial
attempt to just highlight most significant significant differences
between the computer and an oscillator and
I want to now turn us to look into what kind of research or what kind of
Paradigm or a way of proceeding in scientific Neuroscience research of the
brain looks like once we do not start leveraging our Theory and models from
um mind machine metaphor point of view so if we would were to start with the
the oscillation oscillator metaphor so to speak then we would find research
such as this particular one that has been developed and has been out um
just very very recently in February this year and in this particular research
what we find is I I brought this because I thought really illustrates
um the point of metaphors being at the basis of the scientific practices that
we engage with so here what the authors do is they establish an analogy between
oscillator oscillatory patterns and the higher dimensional analog of sonen's
models in musical instruments akin to reverberations
and now I'm quoting them and they say Echoes inside the brain's complex
spatial patterns are a result of transient and dependently oscillating
underlying modes just like individual instruments participate in creating a
more complex piece in an orchestra clear waves of activity like waves in
the ocean propagating in complex patterns within the cortex and the stereotum where each standing wave was
found to cover extended areas of the brain with Peaks distributed in distinct
cortical and subcortical structures forming functional Networks
this is a paper published in nature and what it shows is that the mind machine
metaphor is not the only metaphor so we have debunked at least one argument we
have the bunk the argument that there is no other way so the mind machine is not
the only metaphor and I could also present other papers that have been also developed and are developed under
um the oscillatory analogy um there are quite interesting but this
particular one that I showed is quite recent and it really illustrates the the
this metaphor with oscillatory patterns thinking so the mind machine metaphor is not the
only metaphor at least that much we have the bunt now then the other question that we had was is it the most suited it
may also not be the most suited because if we think about what um these other
researchers uh Freedom uh for in scar that were telling us after years and
years of looking for certain things coming from um that would come and would be
motivated by the mind machine metaphor they finally found what was the problem and why they were on an impasse
so having said all of these at least we can
come to a certain conclusion if nothing else metaphors underlying cognitive
modeling of scientific practice even that often oscillator are a human
practice developing cognitive models is a human practice
now comes the burden of proof to precisely show that metaphors or more precisely cognitive
modeling of scientific practice are a human or is a human practice
cognitive modeling of scientific practice is a human practice because I want to say it requires in culturation
what does this mean this means that through development uh human beings like
us develop the the conceptual and mathematical skills that allow us to um
to to engage in representational skill practices and some of us even become
scientists and develop and design computational models that allow us to
have epistemic gain in in science in
general and in cognitive science in particular and some things to keep in mind with
this notion of acculturation as I am building here is that although the
process of enculturation is ongoing as humans develop the subjective experience
that we have as we are born do not diminish as a result of the acquisition
of symbolic tools of thinking such as Concepts or mathematical thinking
reasoning skills inference skills so the subjective experience is still there
shaping as well the inculturated practices so this embodied experiences that emerge
from organisms interactions with the environment they remain integral to the human perception and understanding so
they in a way what I'm trying to say here is and of course I'm very much here relying on the literature of inactivism
and radical inactivism and Wittgenstein the idea here is that the embodied experience of the world is shaped and
shapes our enculturated more representational conceptual and mathematical and computational practices
even as we develop the ability to conceptually articulate and reflect upon
our situated World involving experiencing or experiences
so the point is that the parameters of obturing adjudicating in both subjective
experience and its conceptual articulation are determined by the social cultural environment that we are
part of what is reasonable to think about what is uh reasonable to feel
given a certain circumstance is adjudicated within a social cultural
environment we cannot step outside of that social cultural environment that that's the idea
Language
so then um building from this way of understanding cognition as a scaffolded
developmental skill or capacities that come from very basic forms of cognition
and experience upon which we scaffold more com more sophisticated and
representational skills such as making inferences thinking believing prepositional thinking
um so that eventually allows us to engage in more sophisticated scientific
practices and we are able to do that because of a
particular um because of a particular property of our enculturation which is language and
in this particular case instead of being linked to particular objects or concepts
the words and Concepts and phrases that we use form a natural form a network of
language practices that are going to determine the meanings what this means from aficentian point of view is that
the meanings of the words or phrases are of or our thinking are dependent on the
use that we give to it in a particular social cultural practice
so language becomes quite relevant in holding this social cultural setting together
language is not a fixed system of rules or definitions language is not mind
independent or transcendental representation but rather it is a dynamic and constantly evolving practice
as its use is different um in different contexts is going to
shape its development so that's quite interesting and relevant
the four language can only be comprehended in relation to and within
the practices and activity of the community that employs it and not in isolation and the same goes as we scale
things up to Scientific practice so the same way in which language can be
thought of as depending on the use of it in a social cultural setting in
scientific practice language also plays that kind of very Dynamic and constantly
evolving practice that we use in scientific endeavor
Mathematics
and um even in mathematics one would say well but it's language language might be
might have this more social cultural Dimension mathematics is really what is holding and leveraging a computational
modeling so how can it be that it is this Dynamic constantly evolving and not
um some kind of fixed system of rules and definitions as one sometimes may think of mathematics even mathematics
can be thought of as this language game um as Wittgenstein tells us in remarks
of flowshift mathematics the real essence of mathematics lies in the
practices not in the formal systems used to describe them and here I'm just going to gesture to anyone that is interested
in or in Wittgenstein about his rule following problem that's what he's
referring to here all right so then um what I want to um say and this was uh what I set up as my
Cognitive Modelling A Language Game
as my task um for this um for this talk was to um say something about
um cognitive modeling as a language game right as a cultural practice of a
language game and now I want to sort of instantiate that from now on and show you why that might be the case and why I
think that I have reasons to think that that's reasonable so let's look at cognitive modeling of
scientific practice as a human practice so we have um we can think about it as a rule as as
a language game that follows rules where you'd find a research question you want to answer you choose the level of
obstruction of your model you select a proper appropriate modeling framework you implement the model using
appropriate software tools and then you validate your model and refine the model eventually but this is all very very
Dynamic and you select the programming languages so what happens is that we can then see
cognitive modeling as a language game why well I'm going to give you a set of reasons if you agree with me
the use of language in cognitive modeling for example mathematics and computer programming languages within a
particular context is used the language is implemented for epistemic gain and
there are a different set of languages that one can choose from from python Etc and that are used depending on the
particular context that one once of the task that one one wants to do um in in science one language might be
more suitable than another or might in terms of epistemic game meaning the meaning of
um the use of language is determined by the context in which it is used I need to understand this coding system in
order to be able to not only design and develop a model but to also for the
negotiations and conversations between scientists and also cognitive modeling is
constantly evolving as new models are developed and new techniques are invented
finally the evolution is driven by the needs and interests of the community of
scientists and in this particular last one is what I think is evidence or reason to think about
cognitive modeling as being culturally situated so then um this brings me to come back
to say that competition is something that humans do from calculating developing sophisticated computers and
computational models then you have many different uh language games in cognitive modeling to choose
Cognitive Modelling Language Games
from you have those that are leveraged by the mind machine metaphor such as the rule-based models that I alluded to
before like classic and connectionists or neural networks models and then you follow a set of rules that I'm not going
to go over them because in interest of time you also have the Bayesian models or the predictive coding inspired models
in which you also follow a set of rules and um and this is very much ideosyncratic to the particular language
game that you are playing finally you have the kind of research that I showed you there is leveraged by
the oscillator metaphor which leads to a different kind of language game which is
a language game that one would say that is played under complexism Theory models
which is slightly different because it does not um leverage from the view of the mind
machine metaphor but of the oscillator metaphor conclusions is started off with this
Conclusions
question and now I would like to answer it um is a computer independent of human
practices I want to say no and the argument that I brought forth here or I
attempted here was um that computation requires human and
culturated skills and that cognitive modeling is a form of computation and
this I think gives us good reason to think that cognitive modeling as a form of computation requires even in
culturated skills thank you so much thank you thank you very much in it so
that's excellent and um Lots there too so I'll keep an eye on
the the chat just to see if there's a there's any queries coming through there but we have a few minutes for a little
bit of discussion and I guess one of the first things so I'm I'm principally
persuaded and essentially already on board um with regards to the the overall thesis
but I guess thinking of it from a someone coming from a different perspective
um particularly someone who has grown up I mean in essence I still have all of those intuitions and habits myself it's
like well um if we want to say well the brain isn't necessarily a computer how would we say that how would you convince
people that it isn't a computer and and just the idea that that's something that would have to be done that that's a way
of framing the question is a kind of a hearing part of the The Language game in which we find
ourselves I guess right the culture of cognitive science um but to give you something that's just a little bit more um specific then so at
the end you're you're essentially um arguing in favor of a plurality of
metaphors and is it sort of a matter of so
um are you a committed to a pluralism and then in terms of deciding as to which metaphor we might use from from
situation to situation that that's essentially a pragmatic manner or is there a a more principled different
kinds of principled um way in which to evaluate or choose between these metaphors um yeah that's a very good question so
as to address the first comment that you made I'm putting pressure on the mind machine metaphor by coming from
um the usual reasons that one is given to think that that's the best way the
most suited way to think about or to start our Endeavor of investigating
um the mind and the brain so I'm putting pressure on why this one so I'm staying with that question why this one I need
reasons and and if we debunk the the best reasons out in the market in the
philosophical Market to think about the Mind as a machine then what then we need
to look around and see okay so what is out there is there any uh then we need to do a task of evaluating or assessing
what we have out there so I'm not necessarily pluralist about all the metaphors I am
convinced that we need some good metaphor um and we need to find
at least some good reasons that lead us to use that metaphor as opposed to a
different one right um but I'm not entirely defending that's the oscillator is better but intuitively
um on a very surface level by the virtue of it being something that we can find
already in the natural world it may be more suited as an analogy to The rhythms
and patterns of this system that is also in the natural world that is the brain
so that's the kind of like um perspective as to pluralism I am
pluralist in terms of techniques so I I brought up this all of these these
different three which is already already allows for us to talk about many uh the rule-based models or the vision models
or the complex systems models these are very different and of course they've been very useful
in many ways so we've learned in past 20 years we have learned a great deal about
neural neural activity by virtue of using these models
but what I'm trying to question here is um whether or not we could learn more if
we were not stuck into thinking or looking for those things that we would
think or expect to find in the brain if the mind machine metaphor were the case
maybe if we were not stuck in that metaphor if that metaphor is the case of
being a bad metaphor then it may be the case that if we release ourselves from it which is really hard because like I
just said doing cognitive science and and Neuroscience is a cultural practice
and it is extremely hard even when one already sees reasons not to think of the
Mind as a machine it is really hard because we are used to this uh language game that has these conceptual toolkits
that come already with it being the mainstream way of thinking about mind
and brain in cognitive psychology so it's really just raising the alert
and being like is this the best way do the arguments for the mind machine
metaphor really stands I don't think they stand what do we do now
and then I do think that the pluraly of techniques is very very much acceptable
acceptable in the sense that what dictates the technique that we are
going to use is the problem that we have at hand right I do want to know about the
structure the structure or the topology of brain of the brain right and in which
case a certain technique might be much more useful where we do not have to focus on Dynamics or patterns of
activity for example as much but if I want to focus on patterns of activity I might need a different kind of toolkit
but this of course in in in requires and Necessities that we
collaborate in terms of bringing these different Frameworks techniques and for
that I think it is important to bring things down to okay these different computational modeling and cognitive
modeling they are language games that we can Implement for epistemic game and
potentially if we bring ourselves together if all of us bring our little toolkits maybe we will be we'll make
more progress so I what I'm I guess I'm curious I I I
Constructivism
like the point and I always find um interesting and useful
um analogies here with Gibson's point about perception in general that in order to see something stationary you
need to be able to move you know Parallax and um and and the movement and the dynamism
of the Observer is essential to effective perception and it there's a sense in which you're making an
analogous argument for um for scientific um measurement and observation right so
we need a multiple perspectives from which we can observe and make measurements if we are to effectively
perceive and be able to better uh get a better grip on the phenomena in question I guess sort of putting on a a realist
hat that I don't really own but nevertheless um we might wear for a moment is to think that there's a a sort of a
concerning constructivism to the philosophy of science implicit in what
you say um and the realists come back to that I guess would go something along the lines
of um scientific practice is in fact a process of disciplining human activity
hello hi sorry about that I'm not quite sure what happened there we just had a a
delightful um internet glitch a bit like the weather sometimes and you
um I wish you good connectivity today um sorry at what point did I disappear
uh well um you will um talking about that you're gonna put on your um your realest hat because it
seemed that there's some constructivism that is embedded here in the at least in the framework that I'm defending
um because if if there's a uh you know if we say so a realist might say well
look there's lots of lots of constructivism or in cultured skills involved in science absolutely fine we
can give you that much but what those skills do is put us in well-calibrated contact with the world that just is the
way the world is and what we find is for example if you know it's one of the some of the
stronger claims of any of the computationalist camps um whichever version of them they just say we just find this just is what
cognition is um it's not a metaphor I guess is the claim that it's it's something more than
a metaphor it's something that we have found to be the case is there a way that we can kind of bring these sort of two
points of view into effective engagement with one another yeah yeah so there's
there's part of the part of the the conversation that I've not brought up because in the interest of time but I
did want to say um that it starts off as being a metaphor and
another problem that there is to metaphors or at least that we have seen in this particular one is that at some
point it metamorphosis into it being the case it being a scientific fact and
that's exactly what Frankie Egan is referring to in the passage that I've read is that it is not a scientific fact
there is no scientific evidence so maybe there is good reason to go back and call
it a metaphor as a pre-scientific level of thinking to find a certain direction
where we should allocate our energy and time um in in developing our models so
definitely it metamorphosis and that's what then um Freeman and scarda have
come to show look you made us go look for this everywhere for 10 years we've
been looking for this and it's not there and not even it's not there it is um it is harming and it's a way waste a little
bit of a waste of our time in the sense that that was harming our thinking our
interpretation of the data as soon as we've released ourselves from that we
were able to make progress so the problem with the metaphor for us to assess whether or not this metaphor has
a place or should have a place in cognitive science is about okay we may have made some progress but is the this
progress that we have made sufficient or to to sufficient for us to accept
um that this should be the way to go the direction that one should take if there is evidence that it might be helding us
back that we could do much more progress by pursuing other metaphors for example of course always
with in the back of our minds that it is a metaphor right so in that sense I want
to address that part of the metaphor that is that can be a harmful is once
the metaphor stops uh being a metaphor to be coming uh to become a scientific
fact without scientific evidence so that's harmful and then the other part
of I think of what you you commented you were absolutely right and I think it needs to be addressed but it is really
destructivism so um I don't think there's a necessity to
go radical constructivists on the framework or way of thinking of
scientific practice I don't think there's a necessity of doing a little bit of a matarana in cognitive science
that's probably a bit much I think um it makes sense to think that there is
like like I had the little graph in one of the sides there is a very good reason to think that there is a natural world
in itself that exists and that we have a
certain perspective we have a stance we have a standpoint now here to use a term from feminist epistemology we have a
standpoint from which we investigate the world and this is our best possibility
so that is it is in that sense that we are epistemic communities in science
that Within These epistemic communities we together build this knowledge which
is a conjunction of the various perspectives and standpoints that people
different people different epistemic communities have and then different types of communities with other epistemic communities they
they communicate their models of a certain object and in this case the
brain or cognitive processes to each other and we reason with each other about what might be the case but it's a
little bit of what might be the case because we have this limited perspective we it's not possible one would one could
could could aim and could claim the scientists claim that it is possible to
have this objective perspective to build science and that science is a discovery so that's really hardcore realism that
science is discovered of what is out there in the world right one could claim
that that's the the hardcore uh realism I think there is a much better reason to
to believe in in science as the continuation of our social cultural
practices because if we look at the or characterize or look at the phenomenon of scientific practices and activity it
is not encapsulated from the world it is highly situated on the world that we
inhabit on our on our own Niche our local environment our local social
cultural values and beliefs and goals so I think there's a much better reason to
to to to to to to take a sense on okay the the scientific practice is taking a
stance from the perspective that I am uh in created and situated at
okay thank you very much yes um I can't be persuaded so
um so we are at this point I think we're probably running a little over time and I I appreciate very much all the time
that you've given us and um your willingness to show your work and my pleasure it's um it's been a
great way to finish off the series for this year and so uh I wish you um all
the best for the summer and thanks very much for for joining us and for sharing your work today yeah you too and thank
you so much for having me what a pleasure thank you
thanks very much so hopefully we will kick things back off then um in September with another series of
