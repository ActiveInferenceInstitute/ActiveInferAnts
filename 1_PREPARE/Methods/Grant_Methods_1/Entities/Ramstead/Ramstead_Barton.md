11:40 Two circles and a line - a good place to begin
18:00 You are a model that embodies parameters of the world
25:40 4E-A approach: Cognition is extended, embedded, embodied, enactive and affective
37:15 Cognition is information processing in the service of maintaining phenotypical integrity
49:03 Variational free energy is a measure of how much wiggle room you still have on your parameters to get a better representational grip on whatever you are trying to represent
49:29 Thermodynamic free energy is the amount of useful energy left to perform work, variational free energy is the amount of room left to keep doing better representation
54:00 How can we be so cool? As living systems in an information-theoretic sense we are a very cold system
54:20 who is much less than the sum of parts 
1:05:50 If I exist in non-equilibrium steady-state, then it will look as if my behavior is generated from a statistical model (called generative model)
1:53:30 Morality is embodied in a shared generative model
2:18:15 (Rigidity of a generative model implies) "Ultimately, you have to be wrong"
2:20:38 What the free energy principle-based approach can't do
2:23:27 If the attractor doesn't exist yet there is nothing you can do. There is nothing to converge to.
2:24:30 Historical change (revolution, terror) can't do it.

my name is Maxwell ramstad I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Jewish
General Hospital in Montreal and I'll be uh I'll be staying at McGill for a for a
while yeah I'm also affiliated with McGill University which is the main University affiliation of the hospital
and I'll be a postdoc in the department of psychiatry at McGill starting next
September yes so basically my background is in philosophy and cognitive science
with some additional training in computational neuroscience yeah so
currently I work on um basically multi scale active inference so multi-state
multi scale extensions of applications of the free energy principle to
basically like systems beyond the brain so like systems well within and beyond
the brain right so what I'm interested in developing is kind of a multiscale approach to cognitive systems and that's
that's how I got into the free energy principle originally so I started off it
more interested in this this field called neuro phenomenology right so like
the the kind of so phenomenology is a philosophical discipline originally and
it's about the kind of rigorous description of first-person experience
so neuro phenomenology was a was a project it's still ongoing in part the
project to bring together this rigorous description of first-person lived
experience with you know the neurosciences and other other sciences
that might tell us something about how experience comes about like first-person lived experience yes I was working on
that for a while and I I was looking for a way to talk about what I think is like
a really central intuition which is that like all of the different levels of
description of reality are like they have some in a way that that's like like there's
there's an equal dignity to all these different descriptive levels so like you know we are physical systems right we're
made of atoms so the laws of you know the regularities that pertain to the
physical world apply to us but we're also biological creatures we're made of cells right and and we have a psychology
right and we conglomerate in social groups that have you know social and
cultural scripts and so we also have like a rich you know infinitely rama
fiying first-person experience and somehow all of these things are true at the same time right so how can we
develop a framework that addresses all of these levels yeah it would equal
dignity you know with take taking each seriously and so you know around 2014 I
was looking for a kind of glue that would allow me to kind of talk
rigorously about all exactly about all these levels at the same time and I I
met Carl Tristan basically and so the rest is kind of history it really really
started me off on my current path and yeah right now I work I work with Carl
very closely and who is Co alfredston yeah but what's his what's his
significance in this picture yeah right so Kristen is I think right now the the
most cited living neuroscientist he's he's known in the field I mean for
several different reasons that what is is probably most lasting contribution is
well so far has been the development of basically the statistical packages that
are allow us to perform neuroimaging analysis and in that in the fMRI
modality so in the 90s he basically invented statistical parametric mapping
yeah which is the the main tech used in neuroscience so is that like
taking the data and it's like a something out of that that enables you
to like interpret the data or actually make sense of it like one thing but actually be able to the whole framework
that I'm going to be explaining it's very complicated it looks very complicated but
conceptually it's very simple you can explain it with two circles and a line I like this thing all right so the two
circles are data right that you have so observations states that you can observe
or measure and latent or hidden states that caused your data right so I mean to
just start with the beginning I guess so
you know are you familiar with fMRI neuro imaging so yeah full mag magnet
yeah so basically an fMRI machine is a big
magnet and you put people in this big machine and it measures it measures a if
the signal that it measures is called the bold signal it's the blood oxygenation level dependent signal so
this is something to keep in mind whenever you see neuro studies in general typically you're not directly
measuring brain activity so these heat maps of brain activity that you see are not directly measuring brain activity
you're always measuring a proxy for brain activity right so in an fMRI that proxy is is the bold signal this blood
oxygenation level dependent signal so basically one of the metabolic byproducts of neural activity has these
interesting magnetic properties that we can pick up using these big magnets
right so you put someone in a big magnet you and then you scan their brain using the magnet and essentially you're
picking up a a byproduct of oxygen consumption by the brain so then that's
your data and then what you do using these statistical techniques that Carl and and colleagues develop is work
backwards from this data to basically the the most probable set of
hidden causal factors that generated your data yeah so he's he came up with
this in the 90s and continued extending these methods so I mean the idea here is
always sort of the same right so with what you're doing is you're writing down different alternative causal structures
or models of the causal structure of the process that generated your data right
so these techniques have been extended recently and in principle you can model
any kind of data using these kind of techniques so recently Carl is used like
the newest version of these frameworks dynamical causal modeling to model the spread of COBIT as it happens so in this
case like the the the data that you're using is the raw numbers like so the
total number of cases total number of deaths and the product the causal process that you're estimating is stuff
like you know is there confinement what is the population size like all of these different parameters in your model that
you're estimating given given your data so that's that's basically like the the
kind of general framework that he developed active inference per se gets into the game when you take the same
kind of framework and say okay what does it look like when the data that I'm
trying to explain isn't like neuroimaging data it's the actual sensory data that I'm generating as an
organism like yeah so that's that's active inference in a nutshell it's it's
a framework to that extends these modeling techniques in a way that it's
sort of like what would it look like if the the organisms themselves leveraged
these strategies to effectively infer the latent causes of their sensory
states so active inference is something that organisms do but it's not the technique used to measure the sensory
data but it's something that that organisms do like we actively
framework is correct so you can think of the active inference framework as this mathematical theoretical apparatus we're
applying to biological systems to understand them but on the assumption
that the framework is correct yeah active inference is something that
living systems engaged in basically this kind of so active inference essentially
has two sides right on the one hand you're you're trying to infer which
which kind of constellation of causal factors is currently causing my my
sensory phenomenology right so yeah um
that's on the one hand and on the other
and this is like a crucial point active inference is about its so this is what
makes it different from like older Bayesian theories like predictive coding for example it's a theory of active sampling of the world so it's not merely
a question of like Basel optimal perception it's a question of how do I
act such that I bring about my preferred observations it's just like this this
tie between the entity acting within the environment taking its sensory input I
try to understand or identifying what's actually causing what so it's like this
interplay between sensory experience and action and that's where I essentially yeah yeah yeah it's a it's a formal
model of the sensory motor loop is another way to think about it okay cool cool and serve
the free-energy principle so come first and what's the relationship between there's a few ways I want to go about
this conversation because I want to talk about cognition and information for assessing and I also want to talk about
I mean the purpose of this podcast is really to find out what the hell the free-energy principle is and like what are its applications and how does it
actually work because in other podcasts like I came across the idea and I'm just being like very excited about it and
like a few of the podcasts that I've had I'm just like oh yeah this thing kind of applies here I just kind of give a
half-baked description of it which is one of the reasons why I want to talk to you just I actually know what the hell I'm talking about
so do you think would make more sense to to kind of discuss cognition and information processing and you know dive
deeper into active inference or just start with the free energy principle and go from there what do you think maybe
maybe I can I can show you a few slides yeah if we can discuss it can we
describe the slides as well just because it's absolutely just to give you I mean
it's really just to be able to see it at the same time so that's for those of you who will be listening the podcast
without any visual support it's really just the two circles and the line thing that I was discussing earlier but it's
it's good it's it's often useful to to see I'm a visual person anyway I don't
know about you know I find it helpful okay so yeah if anyone wants to check out the the YouTube video or just photos
so like all the photos and like you're gonna enable screen sharing long way oh
yeah yep oh yeah right all these privacy
features all right so this is a kind of cartoon tutorial so this is what I was
saying earlier right two circles on the line so what you have is you have data right observable states that you have
access to so again like if you're working in fMRI for example your data is your bold signal
and what we're trying to do is basically go the opposite direction here right so
causality flows from hidden States to data you can also think of prediction is
going in this way right so like if you have a model of how some phenomenon it works you can predict that you'll be
generating this kind of data rather than that kind of data right that's sort of the point of being able to use these
predictive models I mean you see this a lot with the koban modeling right people have a model of how the process the the
propagation process happens and so that they kind of can project the kinds of
well data that they will be registering in the future right so causality or
prediction moves in this direction and inference moves in that direction so these hidden states or latent causes
that are generating our data what we do is we write a model right of the
basically the relations between the factors such that they generate the the
outcome of interest rate and the variational free-energy I think the easiest way to think about
it is that is that it's a it's a measure or more precisely an approximation of how much evidence we have for a model
given the data right so like you can think of I don't know like say two or
three alternative models of how some data was generated right and the free
energy is basically a model of how what's Rea a measure of how well each of
the models explains the data like so how
much of the variance for example your what do you say explains you don't mean do you mean actually explains why it
happens or predicts what's going to happen like is it is it it's not an explanation of how this causes
predictive explanation if we're gonna if we're gonna like draw from the philosophical literature and talk about
like models of explanation so if you're thinking about mechanistic explanation that there are a few missing elements
here but basically like which which you're doing is saying well given the data that I have which of
these models is most probable given yeah like given the observations that I've
made which of these models is most probable and the free-energy is is essentially a metric or a measure of
that that the amount of evidence that the data makes available for each of the
different models what sorry about your continuing yeah so I mean this is the
fMRI setup that I was discussing earlier right so you have a bold signal you have
hidden causes which in this case are the underlying neurobiological activity and
what you're doing is essentially constructing alternative models of for example brain structure or connectivity
right and then scoring how well each of those models alternative models explains
the data that you're generating with the assumption that like the the model that
so it's a kind of it's an abductor kind of or inference to the best explanation
kind of framework for what you're saying is well you know the the model that most
probably describes the actual causal process that generated my data is the
one associated with the most evidence yeah so in in the what so transposing
exactly the same reasoning to the brain you have this kind of setup active inference per se where the data that I'm
trying to explain is the the sensory states of my organism right so like the
states in my retina right the states is like my my auditory organs like my
cochlea and all that like the that my the state of mice you know receptor cells in my skin and
the model here isn't the model of I mean at some stage it might be but like the
the the model is ultimately a model of the agent acting in the world since our
actions are the main driver of our sensory phenomenology yeah so in a
nutshell that's kind of the the framework and in in all these cases free energy is basically a measure of
evidence yeah so I've got I had two
questions one I think I'll just put to you my layman's understanding of it I want you to tell me if I'm right or
wrong and then after that I want to know why is it called wise is free energy the
measure like why that term so the way I sort of see it and I think I've described it to friends is that
organisms and organisms have a model of they have an internal model of
themselves and the world in which they inhabit and they try to enact they try
to act in the world in such a way to minimize uncertainty or surprise and
this is kind of the the mechanism by which it happens so this is like the description of it right I would knew
once that a bit and say that the free energy principle tells you not just that you have a model but that you are a
model right so in the sense that like it's not like you carry around I mean to
a certain extent you do right like there is something like a model in the brain right like it's not
it's not quite that I mean what we would prefer to say I think is that like the brain embodies parameters of a model but
the whole model is something like the brains inference activity so look to think of it this way like this this
issue of model has to do with predictability right so what does it mean to say that I'm a model of my environment well so look we're having
this conversation I'm wearing a sweater right so you can tell from my wearing a sweater or you can predict from my
wearing a sweater that it's it must be 20 degrees Celsius roughly in my room
maybe a bit less maybe 15 right because it's a sweater it's not like a t-shirt
so so there are these like systemic relationships between the organisms
phenotype right and the state of the environment these are predictive relationships essentially so that's the
sense in which you can say that the organism is a statistical model of its environment that's that so like the
physiology of the fish tells you something about the kind of environment that it lives in so the fish is a
statistical model of an underwater environment right so and and the fish's phenotype it becomes extremely unlikely
on land right just like I would be very surprised to find myself in water all of a sudden so that's the intuitive notion
there it's not just that and this is where it departs from older classical like cognitivist theories to an extent I
mean in my view that kind of indicates you know classical cognitivist ideas
through through the lens of these new cool like embodied and active kind of
stories yeah like on the classical story like I I reconstruct an internal model
in my head and that guides my action so that that story is still here in part I
mean you know clearly as human organisms we do construct these explicit internal
models that we manipulate and they're the same kinds of models but there's like a broader notion at play here it's
not just that I have a model is that I am a model and I really okay okay and you said inactive and embodied
and like I've jumped on Twitter of maybe last year and I just keep saying you
know in activism and embodied cognition popping up more and more and I spoke to Lisa Feldman Barrett a while back she's
great yeah yeah yeah and this kind of breeding her book how emotions are made
I think it's gonna just blew my mind complete change my worldview and I guess
very powerful point of view that she's defending I mean I'm very very very friendly to the kind of constructed this
a view of emotion that's being pushed by that group it's very yeah and I guess
just for those who aren't familiar and Maxwell if I you know don't do it don't give do it justice please jump in but
what I took away with from it was like we have all these underlying bodily sensations that we interpret and then
give meaning to in a way and you know they could be we may feel ignoring in the stomach and we may interpret that as
hunger or it could actually be anxiety and like we directly the emotion from that and something and this ties in to
what we're talking about here if you're active inference that emotions in a way [Music]
the I think yeah emotions are like an
emergent form of prediction and they're like how we at this at the at this scale
of the scale of this organism how we predict what's going on the world and then react to it right and like emotions
arise based on sometimes the mismatch of our prediction and the the actual
results yeah precisely I mean we have a preprint that's in revision right now in
neural computation where we make basically that kind of argument which is
to say that well myself and our co-authors Caspar Hess who I collaborate
with very closely Brian Smith is also on the paper these are all like very cool
researchers Kasper is probably the person I've been collaborating with the
most recently he's he has a background in computational astrophysics oh I am still
sharing my screen sorry yeah he so the paper is called deeply-felt
effect yeah so also on the paper is a Thomas Parr who is a UH like a it's
basically a genius I mean Thomas is like one of the most impressive scholars that
I that I know he's Carl's right-hand man basically yeah so and
Myka Allen is also on the paper and myself Mike has a cool intro
interoception yeah yeah he does very cool stuff as well you might want to
check out his his research but yeah so Casper Ryan Thomas myself and Carl are on this
paper and what were essentially arguing is that you can think of basically you
can think of a motion by unpacking it formally in terms of basically state
state inference about your state inferences so like higher level
inferences about how well you're doing with your lower level inference stuff so
we're sort of saying that emotion arises along with kind of implicit
metacognition but as soon as you start to monitor yourself and to assess how
well you're doing implicitly you're you're you're you're moving towards like
emotional types of inference we're like yeah so I mean to keep it simple in a
nutshell that's what we're arguing in that day yeah well what's really exciting about this perspective is that
it brings like you know we used to some people think of emotions as just like
these useless relics so Adam Ally and past right there they have absolutely no
function and that if we were rational they would do away with emotion I guess from this perspective it's like
it's vitally important to how we interact with the world and it's like it's this you could say like is this
compass of sorts that has emerged over time and it's actually highly attuned to
well out ourselves and our place in the world and that without these things without these feelings that we would
just be bereft of any navigational means we just yeah exactly a hundred percent
and I mean so the the we were talking about like embodied and inactive so like
all these breakdown there's if you could break those down in some way typically which we'll hear about is the four e a
approach right so the four es are extended embedded embodied and inactive
and the a is effective so we just covered the a right and so all of these perspectives are meant to be correctives
or criticisms of the traditional kind of cognitivist framework susan hardly calls
this the cognitive sandwich right where you have perception cognition and action
right in that sequence so perception is basically like taking in passively the
world cognition is creating an internal model that you used to then that you manipulate to make sense of the world
and then use the plan action and then action is seen as sort of the motor output of this kind of process so the
cognitive sandwich right yeah so the the fourier approach says this is wrong for
several reasons so that we just discussed the the a reason that it's wrong right cognition isn't just like
this kind of flat calculating process right it's it essentially involves you
know self-monitoring self appraisal you know the emotional reactions right so
the the these are also correctives of this cognitive this perspective right so
the I guess the two E's that kind of come together embedded and extended
which are basically like one more and one less radical version of the same claim so to illustrate it I'll give you
an anecdote Richard Feynman was discussed the famous physicists right who was involved with the
Manhattan Project one of my idols III I love the man he's just amazing so
Feynman was talking to this man who had bought the notes that he'd jot where he
jotted down like a famous equation like the original kind of notes that where he worked out his equations and he said
look you know I have a I have a trace of you know the you're thinking and Feynman
responds no what you have is is my thinking you know it's not it's not just
like a trace or like a testimony of my thinking I I used those equations to
think through them on the paper right so this this comes together under the the
broad rubric of embedded and extended cognition so the idea that like cognition is something that is
essentially world involving it's not just like it's not just like cognition is something that's in the head and
sometimes in some context that spills out into the world in interesting ways it always already involves engagement
with the world and then you know the differences in metaphysics like if you want to say that the world literally
becomes part of the cognitive system as this kind of makes this kind of
cognitive overspill happens like you know if you if you literally want to say
that when you are writing an equation on a blackboard the blackboard becomes part
of your mind then you're in the extended mind cam yeah so the mind is literally
extending yeah yeah you know when it when when possible metaphysical
inconvenience of this view though is that it means that like when you're when you're using Google to perform a query
for for a few seconds or you know whatever fraction of a second it is like
the the servers are actually part of your cognitive processing some people want to avoid that implication and we
just want to jump in is mind synonymous or like what's the connection between mind and cognition here because
I mean I think if the cognition as information processing whereas mind is very different experience that's that's
the nuance in the literature some people I mean I think people more safely talk
about extended cognition yeah I think
that giggles just got a part of my brain and that you know like my mind isn't Google is a little bit crazy yeah so it
is safer indeed from a metaphysical point of view to talk about extended cognition all right rather than the
extended mind I think the thesis is used interchangeably like the label for the
thesis although you're right like that is a Andy Clark I think discusses the
new ones he's one of the people who's who's worked on this a lot his I mean
the original the original paper I think is from is different Park controllers
yeah it's let me make sure Clark Chalmers the extended mind yeah exactly
it's Andy Clark and David Chalmers are the the people who kind of originally
proposed at least the contemporary version of this yeah and Andy has this great book
supersizing the mind which which kind of takes the idea and runs with it yeah but
so I think some people would want to say yeah it literally is the mind that's being extended some people want to say
no it's just cognition but you could also think that this is a bit of a wacky idea and want to recognize that like
there's there's a situated aspect an ecological aspect of cognition without
buying the cognitive process he's actually extend beyond the skull is due to biological do you mean like we are
embedded within some environment and that yeah precisely any interest will be embedded mine yeah extended and embedded
embedded is like the less radical cousin and extended okay it kind of issues the
whole like metaphysics of those the mind extend does it make sense to say the cognitive process you spill out and says
well clearly get some kind of ecologically valid behavior in humans cognition needs to be
scaffolded or embedded in the right kinds of context so it I mean you know for some people who
don't like the radical the radical I'm not one of those I won't I want something more radical personally but
yeah that option does exist though in the literature mm-hmm so what how do you
think of cognition like what is cognition and how is it different to information processing I mean I'm sure
they're very very similar but like when does a form of information processing
become cognition so there is the right question I'm not sure I'm not sure
anymore I mean because by talking about you know like if through this lens and
if I'm writing equations of a blackboard or like typing into my computer or you know interacting with a Wolfram Alpha or
something and that's performing its processing information on my own behalf
when does that become cognition and if it is cognition then to all my cells
because they all process information my immune system is processing information like my hormone is processing information at all times like my
individual cells if I had to I I I'm sort of I don't really like these broad
concepts like life Caucasian no but I mean I I suspect that it's the kind of
thing that breaks down when you look at like the the kind of border cases yeah
yeah I had a a when I was an undergrad like a decade ago like I I I had a
philosophy of biology professor who was an elimination ista bout life
Frederick Bouchard University of Montreal and that kind of stayed with me I think he says like what's an
elimination Estelle it's it's an elimination isten general is someone who
thinks that X or Y concept actually doesn't serve much of a purpose anymore
and she can be used scientifically so a typical example of elimination in the progress of science is like
elemental fire of the ancients right so you know the in in in ancient Greece or
whatever you know they there were these ontologies these elemental ontology x'
right where like the the universe is like for it for Aristotle like a combination of different elements and
you know that there are similar versions of these ontologies like across cultures like you know with different elements
like I think that the Chinese elements or something like metal wood fire you
know we don't have in the West these as ontologies didn't have metal but whatever you know and so fire under
these ontological classifications which were I mean you know they they were sort
of scientific at the time I mean I don't know if if it makes sense to project our modern understanding of scientific
practice back back on 2 degrees but certainly they were using these concepts explanatorily right so like you know
Aristotle thought the things that were of the earth element fell to the ground
right and that's why that's why they fell to the ground because they had an affinity to the ground because they were
of the element earth and inversely for flame right and so so for the ancients
fire was a the element fire was like the
underlying kind of commonality and explanation for what we would regard today is very diverse phenomena all
right like so bioluminescence and little insects like fireflies that was fired right rapid oxidation of wood material
in like a campfire was also fire but the Sun also right which we know is in fire
I mean it's it's nuclear plasma right that was also fire so the progress of
science has shown us that well this concept that we were using doesn't actually have any explanatory grip-it
names things that are heterogeneous in their mechanistic basis and so similarly
one might argue will life is one of these concepts like it it seems to us at
a kind of everyday macro level that there's a distinction between life and life but is there I mean III don't know
and III sort of started to think that these like working on these concepts per
se is kind of moved and so like III don't know if I want to give a blanket definition of something like cognition
yeah because I don't know if there's such a natural kind to begin with right I don't know yeah yeah yeah well a lot
of these categories of concepts I like we the way I think about it is there's just patterns that we interpret right
and there's and we just give a label to some patterns and like you know all dogs have a certain there's there's a certain
pattern that they all have in common but there's a lot of like just crap there's a lot of noise it like doesn't actually
correspond to what actually you know like a chihuahua might seem more like a rat than a you know a greyhound for
instance but there's still dogs so like I think of these concepts is just like approximations that are like good enough
to enable us to work with them right like you can have you painted me in a
corner right and you put a gun to my head and said define cognition I would
say something like it's information processing in the service of maintaining phenotypic integrity right in the
service of keeping me alive I mean and so that's another angle into the free
energy principle by the way yeah yeah I want to come back to it I just thought I would kind of like go through these yeah
because there's a lot to it right as if we're just talking about entities or organisms like maintaining themselves or
like trying to minimize surprise does the discussion of like how they actually do that what they are like how I mean if
we're talking about extended cognition of whatever it was whatever it was like that's if you're really extended out
there then what is actually being maintained so I don't know where I was
going with that but um if we were to bring it back back to the free energy principle and like in terms of just
minimization of surprise with these concepts and discuss though for free yeah sorry I'm sorry that's right you
know it's a lot to take in and it and like you know for that for better or for worse like it all feeds into this
yeah so it may be good to put all the so okay so effective extended and embedded
the two remaining is our I think like the most exciting personally the embodied and inactive so the embodied
mind is this idea that cognition isn't just in the head like cognition doesn't
just isn't just accidentally something that's implemented in fleshy like
wetware systems like cognition like is premise on the existence of an embodied
organism and the basically the embodied mind says something like well a lot of
well you need to appeal to the physical living body to explain a lot of what
cognition is right so you can at least take this and I think three different
ways one one would say well the physical body is Co constitutive of cognition so
I mean you may have seen these really depressing studies that were conducted on judges um a few years ago like where
they after lunch or something they just miss her so much basically what they do is they plot it
so they it's a survey it's study of judges and their acquittal behavior so
like basically they they will they plot your odds of being charged or acquitted
against time of day and so it seems that at the start of the day you have a basically eighty percent chance to be
acquitted and as you approach lunchtime it drops to zero percent and then
there's a bump back up to eighty percent after lunch so it it seems so that the
way that the researchers interpreted this is that it has to do with blood sugar levels like when you have a lot of
blood sugar available you're ready to consider things like more deeply and really and then when you're getting
hungry there's just no more glucose to do the activity so you don't so if someone wanted to say well you
know what cognition is is just like rational purely intellectual activity
well I mean you know this is one of the this is one of the demonstrations if that isn't the case I mean it seems that
the body essentially participates in the ignition another example of this kind of
physical embodiment and its relevance is like phototaxis and crickets is a very
very widely discussed example in the literature so phototaxis is a behavior
that crickets the Crick is basically orient themselves towards mates by
exploiting the geometry of their bodies in picking up sound so basically to
initiate approach of a mate a cricket uses two neurons just two neurons and it
basically computes which of the neurons is stimulated first and it moves towards
the that one because it basically its ears are organized in such a way that
the sound will hit one here before the other and there so the the actual
information processing that the cricket accomplishes is to orient itself towards mates exploits the physical geometry of
its body like rather than having to engage in a more complex computation the
the actual layout yeah human walking is very similar I mean if
you pay attention to to this too much you might hurt yourself but like basically walking the human gait is
falling forward and catching yourself with the next leg
so it just it is not the case as as some people would say optimal control theory
in motor control study it's just not the
case that you have to compute the explicit movement of every part of your limb like you're just falling and the
only thing you need to compute is a limb trajectory such that you can catch yourself as you fall so examples of this
abound it just doesn't seem be the case the like you can think of
cognition in a kind of disembodied way so that's the street just to be explicit disembodied being like brain-in-a-vat
just all the sensory of what comes in when I say if any brain appear in the extreme view but also I mean you know a
lot of the cognitive science like Fodor style modularity of the mind you know
like all these views that say that it's the sandwich model that's being criticized to be right that like you
know you passively intake some stimulus that you you construct an internal model
and the and so it's it's this internal model thing the the embodied mind people
are kind of pushing against it's like I don't need an explicit internal model of how every one of my joints moves in
space right I just don't I don't need to compute that my body is such that the
only thing that I need to compute is where my leg lines to to absorb like to keep me from falling right but so that
that's one way that you can understand the embodied mind another way that you can understand it is to say that oh this
is a more first-person point of view is that like the the my first person understanding of the world borrows from
my embodied disposition so think of metaphors like descent into hell or rise
to glory or something it has to do with the way that my body you know
experiences itself in its live space all right so when you're sad you know like
the entire geometry of your body is kind of like slumpy you know like downwards
we associate downwards to disempowerment and that has to do with the way that we
experience space as embodied beings from a first-person point of view so the last
way you might understand it is in terms of like social embodiment so this is
kind of hegelian it's this idea that like the
literally the the layout of our worlds
embodies something about our culture so you know like a I'm sure it's for having
been I know it's the case in Sydney it's also the case in Montreal like you know our our streets meet at right angles we
use things like traffic signals and traffic signalization red lights all
these things that effectively embody norms so that I mean and this is where
it kind of connects with the extended mind literature like there's another
sense in which the mind is embodied it's physically realized in these artifacts
we yeah the the embody not just knowledge but like you know ways of
engaging the world that like support and ground our coordinated group practices
yeah and so this this releases the free energy principle pretty directly I mean
maybe maybe I should hold off too before just jumping into that you know was
there a final ii am i yes yeah okay good is that like sort of just too many used
to keep track of its inactive negative yeah inactive means the cognition is
something that we do so i mean the idea there is to emphasize like the
sensorimotor loop and to kind of undo the sandwich model so consider the
following like what is a visual cicada right yeah yeah yeah so your point is
like our eyes aren't static but they're constantly moving left like very very small amounts and that's necessary for
vision yeah it's it's it's the mechanism of vision really it's like a lot of what
your visual cortex is doing in interaction with the motor cortex is
kind of deciding where to look next right so there's a sense in which that the classical sandwich model tells you
action sorry perception is in the service of action right and it's it's
it's linear it goes one direction writes with perception cognition and then action and what the inactive approach
tells you is well actually action is also for perception it's really aloof
you know like it seems like specifically superior as well because like you learn
a lot more from acting than you do from just perceiving like precisely from from acting you get all the information maybe
know little you get far more than you would if you're just perceiving um yeah I think that's really where the active
inference stuff gets its teeth from yeah like active inference is ultimately a
theory about how you sample the world so about how you engage in specific actions
that have an epistemic value hmm and that help you design big you ate the
world yeah more understandable accessible and empowering us stacks
within it in a way that's hopefully beneficial for ourselves and does results in catastrophe precisely yeah
yeah and so the I would evolve of them I think like you you can tie all of these
ease to the free energy stuff I mean we started with the effective yeah I mean
there's a lot of work you know from increasingly from our group but mainly
from other groups right now tying this as free energy stuff explicitly into
mechanisms of effective processing so just a question on free energy why is it
called free energy because my understanding of free energy is like energy that is within a system that can
be used towards some end like yeah so the heuristic aliy the way you can think
about it is that the variational free energy is a measure of how much wiggle room you have on your parameters still
to get a better representational grip on whatever trying to represent so there's a direct
analogy in that sense right if the thermodynamic free energy is the amount of energy left in the system to perform
work the variational forget energy is the amount of energy left in the systems
that keep doing like better representational work I mean it's it's
worth mentioning that like they are the same quantity in a certain sense like
the the the information theoretic variational free energy is just a
generalization of the thermodynamic free energy okay yeah I mean that's where
it's a little bit that's where it gets a little complicated and that's where like a background in physics is kind of useful it has to do with these these
deep relations between probability and energy so you know this this goes back
to like Boltzmann and stuff like that like like statistical mechanics so like
if you think of a volume of matter right
like the the more energy is in the system like the hotter it is like the
the more possible configurations it could be in right so like if you think
of a gas and gas like you know it's very hard to predict where any given molecule the gas will find itself in the volume
it can move a lot if you think of a crystal very regular relations right
so the the notion that we use in that kind of context is entropy right so
entropy is a measure of spread essentially so if you think of a probability distribution right over a
set of outcomes right so like I don't know to make it very simple I'm gonna
I'm gonna pull a ball out of the Hat and the ball can be one of four colors and a red red green blue purple
like if I if I don't know anything at all you know about about the balls like
that it's so there are four kinds of balls and our our bag and I'm picking
some out there are not just four balls though in the bag there like as many as I as I need so I want to know something
about like the distribution of balls you know of ball colors well so if if all of
them are equally probable like if in reality there's like 25% of each type
right well the distribution is flat right like because there's 25% of each
type so if you drew a histogram like it would be a flat distribution a flat
categorical distribution right inversely if you know there was only one one red
one blue and one green and 97 purple out of a hundred balls then you would have a
very very peaked distribution right like it would peak over purple and then it
would be very low over the other colors so the first kind of distribution is not
informative right like it's you know it's equally probable everything is flat
we say that the entropy is high in that kind of context because the probability distribution over the system is flat
right and so there's a lot of spread inversely in the second distribution the
entropy is low because the probability is basically all concentrated over one outcome so so it's very informative and
so you get this kind of behavior in physical systems when you consider heat right so a very hot system is high
entropy the the specific particles that
make up a hot system could be in any number of configurations a cold system to the contrary has a
narrower range of states in which it can be I mean you can see this literally as
water turns into ice right like if the degrees of freedom of the parts are
drastically diminished as they end up forming a solvent right so the so there
are these kind of deep relations between the probability of finding the system in
the given state and the energy in the state and so the free energy principle
kind of builds on that it I like to say it kind of jokingly that it answers the
question how can we be so cool meaning that like as living systems we
were we're in the information theoretic sense were very cold systems like so the
the the anthropologist Terence Deakin makes an interesting point he says you
know contrary to the received dogma and philosophy the whole is much less than the sum of its parts
consider an engine right for an engine to work each of the parts that make up
the engine have to be constrained to behave in very specific ways right like you wouldn't want to start introducing
degrees of freedom into the piston movement right because you would you would get some very serious damage done
to your system so so like organized systems like engines and humans and
bacteria like live in very restricted
like subspaces of the possible space of configurations that it could be in like
so you know in in theory you know my body temperature could be 50 degrees Celsius or 3 degrees Celsius but for
some reason it maintains itself at 36 and a half degrees Celsius and you could
say the same for a lot of the parameters that make up my my body and so the
question is well how do you manage to stay there and that's where the free energy principle comes in so it's not
like organisms like we're complex adaptive systems rather like life is
well we are you know remember we are complex adaptive systems and
because we are ordered in such a way we have a low entropy I'm just want to make sure that like communicating this correctly we have a
low entropy because the probability of finding this arrangement of atoms in this state is incredibly low and that
means we have low entropy right and what we do is in order for us to maintain
this state across time based on the fact that the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy is increasing across
time that we need to be taking energy in processing it in some way to ensure that
we maintain this low entropy state across time lens so how does the free
energy principle fit into here is it that's where we're getting right yes the
the free energy principle tells you what so what keep a lot of people don't get
about the the variational framework is that it all rests on a bit of math so it
doesn't make sense to say like you know the is is is the free energy principle true or false it's like well it's the
same status as calculus it's look like you know you don't you don't like
disprove calculus like if there's a problem with calculus you derive a contradiction right or are you sure that
this or that kind of bit of the formalism doesn't follow and the free energy principle is very much the same thing it like if we're really just
drilling down and like just looking at it from the most technical point of view what it's basically telling you is what
must necessarily be true of any system that exists if non-equilibrium steady-state so let me unpack that
equilibrium is where is the end point right so the second law of
thermodynamics is about equilibrium essentially it's telling you like we're
systems were cut we're almost all physical systems are kind of converging towards those where like we just think
it's a fun plate right like once out a hot plate it's hot there that's cold over time the home plate will be the same temperature it all it's not just
the nature of boors a vacuum is that nature abhors a gradient right like nature
things to be perfectly flat so again it's the entropy thing it's like if
nature is trying to flatten all the probability distributions right so I I'm a big fan of ginger ale I like a nice
cold fizzy ginger ale but much to my chagrin if I leave it on the counter for
30 minutes it'll become room temperature and not fizzy right so this kind of room
temperature not fizzy is equilibrium right it's just like the the and you
know if you pushed it to the extreme and you I left the thing I left the the you know the
glass of ginger ale on the counter for two billion years well it will have
completely dissolved and sublimated into the into the environment I mean like after two billion years like potentially
like even the solid material of the glass would have started to like diffuse into the environment like through
sublimation there might not even be a glass there left anymore so one thing to
notice about systems in nature is that self-organization itself is almost
always in the service of increasing entropy and returning to equilibrium so
that that fact is underappreciated I think in in the study of self organized
complex adaptive systems like so think
of a lightning bolt alright so lightning bolt arises because
you have a charge gradient right so like you know it because of like the movement
of particles and whatnot like you get more electrons stuck in one place than
in another and the in striking the lightning bolt corrects the balance
right sorry corrects the the imbalance and it brings the system closer to equilibrium so the same is true of a
tornado right so you have a temperature gradient in the tornado yeah typically
have very cold and very hot air that kind of meet in a way that they're stacked and then like the tornado
it looks like it's increasing order locally and it does locally but
but the cost of it is the increased disorder globally and the same is true of the lightning bolt the lightning bolt
self-organizes around a charge gradient and in striking it consumes the gradient
around which it was self-organized yes so this is true of almost every
self-organizing system they increased entropy and they consumed energy to stay
to sell self-organized so if you think of the star for example you say increase
the entropy do you mean locally or do you mean global good yeah yeah because that's the important distinction right I
was outside and confused because I'd like to know well stuff organized systems want to say self-organizing they process or using they use energy to put
it crudely think of how much think think of how much matter you have turned into poop over the last year yeah I mean just
just dirt like think of how much literally the raw amount of matter that
you have disorganized in order to maintain your own integrity this is this
is the rule I mean yeah is the rule right it's like yeah exactly a lot of
energy right like it I mean all of the energy on planet earth basically used by
living organisms except them like these weird sub marine ecosystems come from the Sun but I think the the figure is
something like it takes 10 times more energy to create a star than a star will output in its whole life in terms of
like the the actual energy that it takes to create a star right like everything
kind of yeah so even a star is is a is a machine that primarily serves to
increase the entropy of the universe so
having said all this you know living systems like bunny rabbits and tigers
and and you know you and I don't self organize to equilibrium
we self-organized to this other thing that's known as a non-equilibrium steady-state so the difference is kind
of intuitive let's take a simple example my body temperature is 36 and 1/2
degrees my core body temperature that is and so that's a steady-state like my
body set that as like a point and my homeostasis makes sure that I maintain
myself at that point so I mean this is a
contrary - like I was saying basically all other kinds of self work in my
systems the don't self-organized to this steady state but rather self-organized
to equilibrium for for organisms equilibrium is death right if I became
if I if my core body temperature kind of diffused to room temperature I would die like quite literally so the free energy
principle basically tells you what must be true of an organism if it exists at
non equilibrium steady state and so it's it's literally starting from information
theory and dynamical systems theory and then like formulating ok so like what
does the system look like when it exists at non equilibrium steady state in these regimes and what must be true of it for
it to continue existing in this in the state in a nutshell that's what the free
energy principle does so how do we begin
to there's a few there's a few ways I want to go over here one is just describing or explaining how we'll be
sort of measuring these things or like is this found in all I guess this is
when you mentioned it's kind of like a tool like calculus it's it's not a thing that's observed it's a way of observing
or way of describing these things right and this is just something that was a characteristic of life so
this is where it gets a little subtle it's so that having said everything about the non-equilibrium steady-state
okay so I didn't tell you what the free energy principle does I just kind of set up the problem that it answers right so
to recap organisms existed non-equilibrium steady-state right so
now we know what that means right so they don't they don't self-organized to equilibrium which would just you know
it's it's my flat and room temperature you know Jenny right all right III
self-organized to my phenotype I self-organized to the set of states that
I occupy most of the time right that make me the kind of creature that I am right so if I'm a fish I self-organized
to a set of states that allow me to exist as a fish right so I'll grow gills right and fins and so on and you know
analogous things can be said for you know self-organization as a human so
given that I exist a non equilibrium steady-state the free energy principle tells me what must be true of me you
know provided that I continue existing at non equilibrium steady state so in a
nutshell that the free energy principle says is that if I exist at non
equilibrium steady state it will look as if my behavior is being generated by a
statistical model of my environment so that's the crucial point is that it's
are you familiar with Dennett's Daniel Dennett's like the intentional stance no okay so it's a position in
philosophy the basically says well what why why is it that we we are able to
treat each other as intentional systems ayiiia systems that have aboutness right
that are able to respond adaptively and intelligently to the environment so then
it says well essentially it's that we we we adopt the
intentional stance it's not that there's something like intentionality in systems
it's that we we for certain purposes adopt towards others a certain
perspective that describes to them beliefs and desires and so on and for
our survival and and insofar as our capacity to explain the behaviors of others is involved its adaptive and
efficient to do so right so this is the so called intentional stance so the free
energy principle has a similar flavor it says like it looks as if organisms the
behavior of organisms is being generated by a statistical model that the organism
is so yeah and the statistical model
like I just I really like the idea of like I think the most intuitive way for me to think about it is the minimization
of surprise which you could think of as this if we are a statistical model as in
that we are like as you said it's not just our brains but our entire being is the model then I like this notion of
minimizing seeing that as a way of minimizing surprised because surprise is not always good right especially for
life surprise could be a lion or it could be a disease it could be anything it could be I mean in terms of if you're
looking at it like just very technically the way that it's set up is that like
surprising the states are not good for the most part and we're talking about
internal states but no oh yeah yeah okay
so I mean it gets a little subtle because humans are also averse to
boredom for example right so yeah it's just about making sure that you never
are surprised right it's just that there there are certain kinds of observations about which you don't want to be
surprised yeah right so like I currently observed that there's a lot
of breathable air around me right I'm breathing very freely right now
similarly like my observations are consistent with my belief that my core
body temperature is thirty six and a half degrees that I still have four limbs right like that so that there are
there are some beliefs about the typical things that I should be observing that
like you know challenging those beliefs is very bad for my survival right like
so if suddenly the first belief that I mentioned right there's a lot of breathable air was suddenly like put
into question by by sensing evidence counter to it I would probably act in a
way to make sure that yeah different was gonna happen because I I need air so
that there's a sense in which like the free energy principle builds in like a
good part of the the normativity involved in existing as a as a prior
preference over certain kinds of data or like observable outcomes like that I fir
- generate certain kinds of data that doesn't mean though that like I I want
to eliminate surprise entirely know what that makes a lot of I mean because you
for one you can't and two surprises informative right and as you go up scale
so this is where I'm very excited about what the reason I wanted to speak in I
think it applies to some of the work that you've done you know about how this is found across scales and yes that
every time but given that we are embedded in our own actions change the environment that as we increase as the
scale increases there is always more to know and we can always be surprised and now then we're at this as planned now we
are a planetary species we have a whole host of things to be surprised by now that we there's a sense in which like
the so this notion of prediction error it effectively replaces the the
classical notion of signal so consider the following like a one-to-one map like
a 1:1 scale Knapp would be completely useless right like I mean imagine like you know you're
visiting New York for the first time like a one-to-one scale map like you know it would be it would be like bigger
than a building right like the actual amount of paper so like in order to be useful at all a model has to be simpler
than the the data space that it's modeling right you know like so there's
a sense in which like just by construction for a model to be useful it will have to generate error and so in
the kind of this is slightly broader than active inference and the free energy principle it's the Bayesian brain
with slightly older you know approaches developed like in the 90s and 2000's so
like from that point of view signal like the signal that the organism perceives
is a prediction error like because basically the idea is like if if the if
my sensory observations match my expectations there's no sense in processing it it's just it's what I
expected whatever there's no sense in a noble izing my metabolic resources to address a percept that I had perfectly
predicted and that you know if I'm hooked up in the right way like you know addicted perception just kind of roll
off you know yeah yeah I'm needing to engage them yeah so that there's a sense
in which like all signal is error
it's efficient that way because yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's that's what I'm Lisa Feldman Barrett was that's what
she I don't think she discovered but that's what she spoke about a lot I kind of forgot about that part of it that's
um that's really interesting it underlies a lot of the like motivation
for the approach right so we're saying like an organism embodies a statistical model of its environment meaning that
like there's a kind of average value that it expects to encounter for different classes of stimuli right and
the organism will only be prompted to process like a stimulus when there's a
deviation from what it expected yeah and so there's an extra twist that makes it
especially interesting and that makes it robust to some objections it's not as a
darkroom problem I think it's an on problem honestly but so the Darkman
problem says okay well if there's this surprise minimization thing going on why isn't it the case that I just find a
dark room and stay there because that would be a great way to avoid all prediction error right if I predict that
I'm in a dark room and I'm in a dark room there's no prediction error and so why don't I just do that two reasons I
think kind of spring to mind immediately the first is that you can have an X I mean so we're embodied right to bring it back
to the embodied mind like my body is a statistical model like it's a I embody
expectations about you know my environment so for example I have expectations about my blood sugar level
right and so staying in a dark room with no food is gonna you know frustrate some
of my expectations about my blood sugar level such that at some point I'm gonna you know move out there are more direct
ways to gerrymander it a bit and I can see why you might find those like less principal you could for example just
stipulate that you have an aversion to you know encountering no surprise for a
while there's no reason why you couldn't do that like just to bake it into I mean but there's a more principled way to do
the same so this free energy quantity that we've been talking about what you can do is
kind of think about how it evolves in the future so you can think like for
every possible course of action that I can take how much free energy is associated with that with that course of
action so when you have this future a future-oriented or this kind of this
extended construction of the free energy it's called the expected free energy it turns out that for some using these nice
mathematical tricks you can decompose that into basically a pragmatic
component which is basically how close do I get to my preferred observations and an epistemic component which is
irrespective of how close I get to my preferred observations am i gaining any
information by making this observation so like I don't know it's it's 3:00 in
the morning you come back from the pub you're hungry right you stumble into the kitchen right but it's 3:00 in the
morning so it's dark the first thing you do is open the light well I mean from a
kind of classical kind of expected utility theory perspective that's a bit puzzling because you don't get any
immediate gratification from opening the light you know it's not like it's not like you're getting like you know like
sexual gratification or like you know food stuff immediately from opening the light the old but we do though right
like you know we open the light and the reason we do is that like there's information gained from doing that so so
an action basically has an pragmatics component the the pragmatic affordance
or a value of a of a policy and the epistemic component and the value or
policy so you another way to respond to this dark room objection is to say well
look like the organism also acts to
basically increase its epistemic grip on its world so there's a point at which
like the there's nothing more to gain from just like staying in the darkroom and so
you'll probably you know here's something outside the room and want to disambiguate what that is you know yeah
I'm curious about what the implications are or what we know about this and
social species where species have to coexist and collaborate
you know they can't exist in isolation they need these organisms need to interact and cooperate in order to exist
and I'm thinking of you know bees and ants but also you know humans um what
does I worked a lot on this like that's sort of one of my the main thrust of my research is extending this active
inference business to a social and cultural behavior and I guess the main
idea there is that these these models
that I was talking about earlier these statistical models so they're called generative models because so technically
these models there they are the joint probability distribution over systemic
States and external States so systemic being the organism yeah exactly
it's internal States it's active States its sensory states and some some set of
external states yeah yeah so wait sorry I lost my I lost my idea
there yeah I think I've been there once or twice this conversation - we're
talking about social species I'm sorry yes so they're the so these bottles I
was just saying this because they're called generative because because of the setup that I was describing earlier right you can use these models to
generate the kind of data that you would expect if the model was the case right
so like having a generative model kind of sets you up with I don't want it like
I don't necessarily want to say normative but the kind of it sets you up with like the
a a grip on the kind of typical observations that you would make given
the kind of creature that you are right so that's that's literally what what it
does it's a it's the joint probability distribution over some external states right and some organismic states so the
way that we do cultural and social dynamics under this approach is to say okay what happens if several agents
share the same model so again like the model essentially harnesses your
expectations about the way states of the world which could be social states hookup to the kind of typical
observations that you make right so one way to talk about sharing the social
world is in terms of sharing a generative model ie sharing a kind of statistical model about how the
observations that I make typically a pond two states of the world and if if
we were to just translate into everyday language like people seeing the same
phenomena in a set in the same way exactly sharing the same expectations yeah and prior beliefs about the world
and about how my sensory phenomenology relates to aspects of the world yeah
nutshell so I mean there's some pretty compelling simulation work done on it's
by Chris frith and Carl Fuerst and mainly although it's been extended on
basically little agents it's like birdsong simulations so you
have a little agents that sing a song and they're able to coronate like little
simulated birds they're essentially able to coordinate their singing behavior and recognize when they're singing versus
when the other bird is singing by sharing the same generative model yeah
so I mean the idea is sort of that if we
share the same expectations about the way that states of the world map on to our observations and the way that
states of the world involved then you know there's a sense in which each of
our coordinated each of our individual behaviors end up coordinated because we
expect the same outcomes right yeah so
so that's how we and Dewey so it's like I think about it like this if we're all
I don't know drivers are something wrong people and we all have a map if the map is the same and we're kind of working
with other people who kind of go on the same roads or in some if we're all following the same map we'll end up
going to the same places if there's like some sort of directionality or you know X is the spot I know that I've got a
compass is the map I will go in that direction at everyone else will but it's exactly not the same and people might
come that's the and yeah so there's some cool results this is Eddie bulik who's currently at
UCL she's done she's done a lot of hyper scanning are you familiar with this
hyper scanning or socials guess it's a multi brain neuroimaging it's like the new thing right now so like rather than
just scan one brain yeah like in real-time you hook up several people to
the fMRI or EEG or whatever your modality is and you you can you can measure brain to brain information
transfer yeah it's it's a cool it's a cool do a lot of what we're doing now is
gonna be combining like this hyper scanning set up with active inference
malls that use multiple agents so that we can I mean are the participants doing
things like like I first think of like video games sports choir jazz bands it
depends I mean like there's been hyper scanning done on people the cool thing
about some of this hyper scanning stuff using more portable technologies that you can have ecologically realistic
settings so that they've used EEG which are these like caps that pick up scalp electrical activity in operas for
example to get like people's real-time impressions of like seeing a show together in this case it's it has
more to do I mean these are techniques they're used in several different studies I mentioned Etta's work because
she has some cool data where like it seems that wrote I mean this is one of
the things that I have to check with her if we can put it on the internet yet so we might have to cut this out but this
may just be for your own benefit but like she has this cool work that shows
that basically romantic partners don't don't
they don't attuned to each other anymore they don't have to like that they're not actively trying to adjust to the other
person anymore because they have they have such an accurate model of the other person so
there's like a sweet spot there's like those predictions if your models are not
similar enough like if you don't speak the language and you're not from the same culture there's not enough
commonality to start adjusting but if you're if you're too similar there's no need to adjust yeah yeah yeah so there's
like an inverse you curve kind of thing going we're like on the one end like there's perfect synchrony because you
have the same model so this it's like these romantic couples that don't really need to check with each other anymore because they just
know they know what their partner thinks right it's like oh people they just don't talk to each other because they're just telecommunication exactly yeah yeah
so so like the the kind of overall framework you know kind of gives you this inverted you where like you know
the yeah it's all about the extent to which you share a generative model and so yeah I think that that kind of well
illustrates like this the kind of generalizability of the approach yeah yeah I be we I mean this is a bit sad I
guess but be funny to see if it predicted divorce you know like incoherent models just like I'm sure
that I'm sure they would right because that's how a lot of divorces arise right people acting in one way that doesn't
you know here with what their partner wants and over time yeah I mean so the
these these techniques I think are being scaled up
more like you know interesting you know socially rich human behaviors yeah and
yeah so it has to do with the full pipeline I mean so I've been I've been talking about like the the side of this
that I'm like coming from Moore which is like the the kind of computational
modeling side but I mean to to return to
the if you don't mind me sharing my screen for a second again place place
I'll of course describe what's going on
[Music] yeah this is what I wanted so the the
whole the full pipeline that we're considering is this kind of thing where like what I've been talking long mainly
so what we're seeing now for those of you listening is three circles so you
have two circles on the side that are pointing towards a middle circle the middle circle is data and the two side
circles are the modeling bit that I've been talking about a lot in the experimental side of things that I I
alluded to a bit when we were discussing this fMRI stuff right so like and this
relates to our earlier discussion of like you know is this an explanation really like the full stent the full
pipeline is this thing here it's it's a combination of experimental and modeling
techniques that are kind of joined at the data so basically you you start with
either end so suppose you start with an experimental setup like we were just discussing your your which you have is
like people performing a psychological task and you're getting either you know
neurological or behavioral data are both from them right so that's this side of
the equation here right so you have an experimental setup that generates some data and then what you can do is write
down a generative model of the kind that I just described or rather what you what you end up doing
is writing families of generative model the kind that I just described that each represent a hypothesis about the causal
structure of what generated this process that actually generated my data so like
it so in this in this instance like each of these models is is a model of one
possible hypothesis about you know the the causal factors involved in the
experimental setup the generated the data in the first place right so you construct these models you score them
using the variational free-energy to find the most probable one right and so that that model that you end up
selecting encodes a hypothesis about the structure of the process involved in the
experimental setup so now what you can do is kind of bootstrap your thing right like you can use the fitted model right
to make better predictions about what kind of things you would have to test experimentally so then you can refine
your experimental setup and generate better data and then using this better data you can construct new models that
are more refined to make pointed hypotheses about the structure of the process that you're investigating and so
you get this cool kind of bootstrapping self REITs like virtual racing feedback
ions yeah that's really that's an underappreciated point like you know III
I see these kind of partial criticisms
of the active inference framework that go will you know like surely these computational models aren't a full story
you know like you're you're not really talking about the mechanistic implementation which is fair it's but
the thing to keep in mind is that the full framework necessarily includes this
neuroimaging aspect that makes very pointed hypotheses about brain structure
for example yeah and in fact if you think about it the origins of the
approach you know are in fMRI so like the the behavioral modeling thing that's
kind of become front and center that's gained so much attention is just one part of this whole process I
mean so as a philosopher the thing that gets me really excited recently is this
thing computational nosology so this is where we're moving towards a kind of meta science or a meta Bayesian meta
science so I mean to rehearse the argument you can have if you apply this
framework to some set of experimental data like a bolt signal then what you're doing effectively is writing a model of
the underlying neurobiological activity that might have caused your data right we've discussed this active inference is
takes the same kind of approach and says okay here the data are the sensory signals that I generate in engaging with
the environment and the model is a model of me acting in the world okay so what
what happens when the data that we want to explain is the result of the scientific activity itself so for
example what happens if the data that I want to explain is a psychiatric diagnosis right what I want to explain
is the diagnosis of you know the actual diagnostic act of you know saying
telling a patient you have schizophrenia well then the model is becomes a model
of the diagnostic process and then lo and behold we are part of that model as clinicians and experimenters right like
the the generative models that we use in this sense of the active inference sense
right the the models that I bring to bear as a clinician to make sense of the
clinical phenomenon and presented right and also these models like the models of how like the the hemodynamics and so on
like real fever exactly all of that is oh in this kind of meta Bayesian approach where like the
the full model of the diagnostic process includes the models that I use this as a
theoretician and the the clinical models that are used by like a psychiatrist so
this is where we're going like so it seems to me it's just like the scope of what is actually important is far
broader it not just the actual experiments of the models themselves but it's those who are actually well running them and actually
coming up with it yeah so wet is where's the boundary what is it I mean so
remember the the free energy principle is a theory of a non equilibrium steady state so if if a system exists at non
equilibrium steady state it can be explained by the free energy principle this isn't just a hypothesis by virtue
of what it means to exist at non equilibrium steady state for principled
reasons you can appeal to the active inference framework a very cool stuff to
do it so the extent that science is just another you know large-scale human
activity with its own not equal to Rijo steady states then it can also be model yeah well this kind of brings me to the
point about social systems and and all that and I guess taking this and
applying it to our politics and our societies and I mean we all have is
aligned I'm working right now with my PhD student on the constitution of
epistemic communities so like it sounds very abstract in one sense but like so
think of like you know you seen these maps of like the the us like electoral
politics and everything where you have like these little islands of blue and these seas of red right yeah so close
they are of the perspective that we're advancing here I mean it may be that
like people are literally living in different worlds in the sense that like they are no longer the same kind of
creature they don't they don't have the same generative model like just the we
we've effectively you know the the course of politics and for example the
United States but I think increasingly elsewhere especially I mean like the
information environments in which we're living in I'm just so like because we can select what we you know through
Twitter Facebook and how these social media environments we can construct our own information and they in turn construct us and what I
think is yeah and that is a beautiful point and that this is one of the things that we've really drilled down on on the
active in the active inference family of things I mean you in the discussion before we
started you mentioned axial constant who's a really close friend and collaborator an axle is responsible for
also with the yellow Brandenburg but Axel is like one of the people who's really championed this for the idea that
well so the active Infernus formulation is symmetric you know I was telling you about the this predictability stuff
earlier that like you can predict stuff about the environment given my phenotypic state well not symmetrical okay like you can
predict something about the kind of things that live in an environment by looking at the physical structure of the
environment like the relations of prediction are kind of circular in that way and certain creatures like ants and
beavers and humans have evolved such that like we we extend our statistical
models into the world like we we we ought meant the physical world with but
by allowing it to encode information that we can use to guide our behavior so
think of like you know the fact that in most big cities streets meet at right
angles isn't accidental right it's a feature that we design right into the
physical layout of our cities to to improve our predictive grip on them
essentially like to make it to make our coping with them smoother same goes for like you know traffic signals and stuff
like that so I mean there's a sense in which this story opens on to something
like and this is what we're exploring in in our current work like the this kind
of opens on to a story of epistemic communities and like epistemic Miche
creation right like we we we design environments
in order to better like to get a better predictive grip on our environments and
that might explain in part like the kind of fragmentation that you see right like
that we're literally creating two different kinds of worlds that are
embodying two different kinds of well outlooks or we would put it in terms of
different generative models yeah yeah yeah a direction that I'm very excited
to pursue actually I think you know what there's a lot to say there sure and when
you consider that so right I haven't made a public yet but it's um it's a I guess it's two articles one is just on
the Internet and control and why how it's a human rights issue and one is that the Internet is just necessary for
securing human rights and secondly we do
not like our access to like it is it is so vital today but our access to it is
actually well it's under threat at all times we may not know it but like it
could be taken away from us at any point and in some places it has been I mean China is the greatest example of
government censorship but there's like dozens of countries have stopped social media or like interfere with social
media and messaging apps and when the state or went you know privately held
interests can effectively dictate what is in one's information environment they
can do a whole range of things from manufacturing consent to well you know
just changing how people think and and and how they acts in the world and I
think it's a it's a huge huge problem and one that like I don't really know
what the solution is because if you know if you take the liberal idea that you know we should be free to go out and do
is do whatever he wants within reason within certain bounds but you know I should be able to expose myself to
whatever information I feel like as long as it's you know not hurting anyone or anything if that's actually if we agree
with that then we can't actually impose these informational constraint saying that you know it's all well and
good for each for you to go ahead and do that however we need you to be we need our generative models to be
somewhat coherent or we will conflict yo or things just break down yeah like in a
really deep way yeah I totally agree I mean you know what a huge issue is uh whose principle is it that it takes it
takes an order of magnitude more energy to dispel than it does to create it right
someone's rule I forget I forget what whose rule it is but I mean yeah the
that's a real issue I think you know the I mean I I I'm definitely not a liberal
I'm not a conservative either so I think you can kind of situate me you know pretty clearly uh yeah no I I don't I
I'm sort of grappling with the same kind of issues that you are here like I yeah I also value freedom of speech and
freedom of expression but on the flip side like there is something like
there's like an ecology of memes you know like the there there there's only
so much like physical space that ideas can occupy right so like that I mean you
know minds are like in on the net oh yeah on the net and like physically in
space yeah as well they're technically the same right like ah yeah I mean that is an embodiment yeah exactly
it isn't Bartek yeah so I mean I'm sensitive to that I I'm very worried
about like the creation of like these fact resistant you know bubbles
uh but you know like the there's a sense in which like I think the the current
Information Age exposes a lot of our kind of innate shipping inherited like
evolutionarily old psychology right you know like the what gets called virtue
signaling oh yeah I think I think happen is both on the left and on the right the
show official I think ultimately the problem is that like we we have
forgotten how to engage with ideas and what takes the place of engagement with
ideas is signaling to your in-group whoever your in-group is your values are
consonant with theirs in my last conversation we kind of touched on this
and one of the observations that the guest Matthew Bukowski made which is you know very very passionate and and true
is is that social media kind of it
rewards signaling but not action yeah like we're all engaged you know we're
incentivized to just signal great things right things about our lives or our
ideas or whatever and that signaling is enough it doesn't really matter if we're going out and doing stuff and we need to
move from signaling to action especially in the filter to your Facebook I stand
for you know breast cancer victims like oh you've just saved it you've just your cell with it and you
know I think we're all guilty of this I am myself absolutely and that's what I'm saying like I think it's a it's an issue
everywhere it's it's an issue you hear about it a lot because like right-wing
pundits accused like left-wing activists of virtue signaling a lot but I mean III
think you can see the same essential cognitive strategy redeployed everywhere
essentially so I mean that that's that's
something that's sort of unfortunately predicted by the kind of theory that we were working with oh that's brutal
yeah well because like what you're what we're saying ultimately is the work action is in the surface is in the
service of generating evidence for our beliefs essentially
right so like things that things that conform to our broader yeah so like it
it takes a lot more cognitive energy to like confront you know observations and
data that don't provide evidence for your belief and in actually her I mean
in literals yeah yeah and I think it's like I think of this as like we are
constructed by of we are information right like who we are these are the ideas like the person I think I am is a
collection of these ideas and I've kind of brought together and right I identify with and if I find something that I
disagrees with them I am actually being attacked in some in some way right and I
think that's where that pain comes from because it's like there's some oh yeah I made that is was a lot more complicated because I mean you know left and right
what you're seeing today is a rise of identity centered politics I don't want
to repeat like you know kind of dumb right-wing tropes about identity politics yeah yeah it is true but like a
lot of the politics that we see today on the left and on the right concern questions essentially relating to
identity right yep so you know it's not virtual it's not first as we spoke about
earlier um like that you can basically categorize something an infinite number of ways some categories are just kind of
a bit better at like at whatever you're trying to do so on the one hand I don't want to compromise like I you know
activism based on legitimate you know
like you're suffering of a particular group in house right yeah the show of a
showing it like you know denunciations of you know forms of oppression that are
rooted and like I don't know in the u.s. like you know slavery yeah elsewhere like and you know
histories of colonialism and everything I mean you know as an Australian in the Canadian we should know a thing or two
about like colonialism right you know we come from countries where like you know
it's some of the only like actually quote-unquote successful genocides have been carried out right
oceans of blood yeah exactly where people have been systematically exterminated like and where we're like
that was carried to completion I mean in there are places in Canada where that
was carried out against four stations people and I mean you know the this is
the actual genocide of the conquering like all that and you know the same thing with in Tasmania or the yeah so I
mean I don't want to minimize those legitimate airings of you know like or
but but on the flip side like when when you make your identity into your thesis
it becomes very dangerous to disagree or to argue about that you know so like if
your main thing is all if your main thesis is like us something about you know American identity real American
patriot or whatever then it seems to me that like you know disagreement will
quickly collapse into like yeah you're attacking my identity yeah like my
deeply held sense of Who I am so I mean III also think it's probably not the
most productive way to the frame discussion on the flip side like I
haven't quite squared the circle of how you how you recognize that danger on the
one hand and also recognize the legitimacy of identity based you know
like legitimate grievances and being there a yes it's a tough one I think one
way that kind of it doesn't solve it it doesn't definitely doesn't solve the problem but I think a lot of this
discussion of identity is rooted in inequality problems of equality and I
think there's too much of a focus on equality in terms of income and wealth
even though it's a great proxy for well-being and all that it's just not
good enough the quality of opportunity is something that we should really be focusing on more and as I
said you know wealth is a great proxy for that but if you can't read it doesn't matter how much money you have right um you don't have as acts you
don't have as much access to the world as someone who is literate or if you have shelter or if you're adequately
nourished you have access to the Internet so by focusing on I really like
the idea of focusing on equality of opportunity and seeing like the importance of increasing the landscape
of opportunity to people because if you think it like freedom is in binary right freedom exists in degrees and if if we
want if one of the aims of society is to ensure that our citizens are flourishing one way of ensuring that that happens is
like you make them as free as possible like an increased landscape of opportunity as much as possible so they
can go and choose to do things it's in to it in order to do that you need to ensure that they have their basic needs taken care of sir you know shelter
nutrition the ability to read perhaps all these things increase the landscape of freedom and then the individual they
know their map of themselves is the best right there's nothing better than their internal map of themselves so they will
choose to live a life that maximizes for their own flourishing so if we wish to
ensure that our populations are flourishing we sort of should kind of increase the degrees of freedom that I made available to them and let them
navigate an unfortunate thing about neoliberalism is that you know in in in
the current kind of set up what freedom means is like the freedom to choose between 36 different flavors of ice
cream yeah yeah it's I think it's just a bit of it I don't think when we had
these conversations wildly enough like what is the purpose of society know what is government working towards like what
does a good life mean I mean I think you know we might have that conversation around a campfire with a joint you know
but it's like so we don't hear like our politicians actually having these conversations all I hear is this retro
jobs yeah I totally agree I mean so I've been setting up a an international
Neuroscience network over the last year or so and we're really trying to foreground ethical reflection because
currently I mean you know this whole ethics review board business is basically a box ticking exercise
right we're like you know in science the way that it basically works as well you
know when when they were like figuring out like these you know the wording of
these Accords right like the regulate research on humans then they involved
philosophers and everything but like it's sort of like they settled everything you know wet like at that
point and from now we're not really thinking about like the ethical implications of our research we're just
making sure that no one's gonna sue us yeah which is what the IRB is do so we've effectively evacuated ethical
discussion from like the practice of science and so yeah ethics usually means
in science like you got a board to review and it's pretty safe from a legal point of view like there's not gonna be
any like legal blowback yeah well that's a very very thin conception of like
ethical reflection about the scientific process I mean I couldn't agree more with you like the these things have
really been sidelined like much to everyone's detriment I think yeah yeah
it's I think we're gonna see a resurgence in well ethics ethical discussions ethical thinking I mean we
were I think that we already have it's just like done through the guise of environmentalism and you know like
fighting for the biosphere and you know humanitarianism so I take that back ethics is still there we just don't talk
about as ethics for like we just appeal to you know human nature but I'm really
excited to and this is one of the reasons we're I'm spoke to you what I'm where I wanted to speak to you and I
think will guide a lot of the conversations that I'll have over the next future over the coming the coming
weeks and months and years but it's just like what are the physical characteristics of things that are like
what is the material basis for that which is good you know like if you if you take damn I mean you
know well there's a question like yeah well I think like it's I think we have
like some of a somewhat of an idea like just intuitively like systems that are
complex like there seems to be a correlation between the complexity of the system however you wish to measure
it and its ethical value right so I'm excellent I have an ongoing disagreement
about this the the disagreement is basically axel thinks that morality
itself can be absorbed under the free energy principle and I don't necessarily
disagree but I want to push back against that as much as I can so for the simple the following reason like I think that
like you know with the free energy principle etc will will tell you is where the system is converging how it's
converging like what it is converging towards essentially right like so - no
that doesn't mean that it's a good idea that things are converging in that direction though yeah see that's like
this objective like there is this objective morality that states that that thing that is that you were converging towards is good right it's like separate
but I see morality is like it's actually emergent as well right like you let me and maybe perspectival
so if let's take this account seriously it sort of implies that morality is
embodied in a shared generative model right that like has effects in terms of
like you know allowable cultural practices allowable ways of like living
in the shared environment but the implication of that is that like you know the kind of moral standards are
ultimately relative to you know the shared generative model so that like
what do you do then when there are groups of people who come into contact
that don't share a generative model like I like I I find it difficult to because
the scientist in need doesn't see like the the possibility of there being like
some sort of external way to arbitrate between the sets of so it's irreducibly
complex right and but we cannot put like it's it's too chaotic we can't predict any of this it's something we can just plug things into a formula and then say
oh look this is the more ethical decision it's just like exactly impossible precisely I mean I
you can only find the most likely decision no I think I think that's where
these heuristics come in right like you know thou shalt not kill like these 10
commandments are like they're kind of just like guide rails for Humanity because a lot of it's really hard like
we I think we've been trying to like figure out what we're like what is good
and I think you know like these like the the the rule based stuff is just kind of
like oh we've got a bit of an idea like 9 times out of 10 these rules are right the question of like I think there is
like some material I think this can be
described in terms of energy and information I'm just not too sure how
but I think it's like if you were to take a word that's that's what Axl ends up saying I think I don't want to put
words into his mouth but yeah the ends up saying something like well you know it is about constructing the right
generative model so if if we can if we can just like get a picture of what the
adequate moral system would look like and all share this generative model then
you know we would end up converging to something like you know a socially
acceptable situation so I guess this brings me to write the last topic I want to count before we wrap up and we're
kind of speaking about it before but one of the implications so like I guess
logical evolutions of this just applying of the free energy principle applying it
to humanity is just like they need for like we are a social species we are
engaging at scales that are you know increasing as as the years progress if
we are trying to minimize surprise for you know to put it put it in those terms
and one things one of the things that we really really need to do is integrate the sciences into our politics into our
decision-making because like it is it is truly a matter of survival and we may be
hit with some things that I mean they may not be too surprising to some but
you know coded the array of challenges that we're facing with which actually threaten our
not only our survival but like the survival of you know lots of life on on the planet like it makes what the free
energy principle says to me is that we actually need to take these epistemic tools like you know science like these
frameworks these ways of being in the world and extracting information and putting it to use and actually making
them a part of our as our culture in a way that's far more like far more
embedded and far more well I guess useful is sort of an ethical imperative
the falls out of it I think with the free energy principle would tell you is that well if you don't do this you're no
longer gonna exist at non-equilibrium steady-state right it's just that but that is where we're going collapse
that's where we're going so yeah I mean the the the issue is it again has to do
with generative moles it's like the generative models typically have a temporal depth built into them so
basically like how many times steps into the future is your model able to model effectively and I mean it may just be
that like the the temporal scales at which were actually having an effect on
the planet don't match up to the temporal depth of the models that we're using to deal with so like you know the
the the time of everyday phenomenology is kind of a cyclical kind of like
24-hour thing where like you'll plan maybe a few weeks or months or maybe years ahead but like there's a mismatch
between that scale right like the scale of the generative models that we use
effectively in everyday behavior and the scale of the effects that we're having
on the environment so I think that the the you know the political decisions
political decisions are made with like a two-year window at most right maybe four depending on the country but like you
know it's little guarantee the next election you know it so of course
there's like this huge incommensurate ility right like because the the the timescales of our practical can
and the time scales at which the threats the existential threats to you know our continued existence as a species like
that it's this in commence or ability that I think needs to be bridged yeah with any hope of you know yeah that's um
that's a natural article that's where I'm cynical I think if anything like
this rise of virtue signaling you know on the left and on the right it points
to the fact that like you know the the the kind of disembodied ideal of a
rational actor you know it isn't really what's at play here like people are I
mean I think at was Isaac Asimov who said you know our fundamental predicament is that we have Paleolithic
Minds medieval social institutions and godlike technology right like with our
minds like our brains were optimized to handle you know it's Dunbar's number right it's an each of about 150 people
timescales you know the point of culture in part the conservative power of
culture is to obviate the need to think about long term regularities in any kind
of detail I mean that's the point of constructing a niche you don't have to deal with time because everything that
you need to deal with the temporality of the world is already pre encoded in our practices and in the physical layout of
an environment so like the I see no reason to believe that like suddenly we're gonna start
shifting our perspective if anything I think like you know we we've constructed
like these these informational Ecology's that make us more resistant to actually
you know challenging the depth like the temporal horizon at which we're engaging
with phenomena and rather just like signal to our you know our people like
us that we're on we're on the right side of history we're doing this right and they disagree because they're bad guys I
think that's far more likely that you know I maybe maybe the promise of these meta
Bayesian approaches that I was alluding to you miss to kind of sketch you know
some paths or ins yeah actually like doing that without an you know
infringing upon people's freedoms like if you just look at the US like they
have as freedom-loving and I use that I say egg quotes because like I think they've got a certain view of freedom
that I don't think everyone would agree with you know like you are free if you have a gun you know you are more free if
you have you know you can bear arms or if you don't have your text as you'd have to pay as much in taxes because you
know taxes of theft and I think I'll um be right yeah I just hope that like I
think one of the most important things is as we said like taking our so we have
evolved to exist in smaller tribes right but one of the wonderful things is we
have developed this capacity to extract really useful information from the world and explain phenomena with it right back
science and our challenge is to like take this you know godlike capability
and use it with look I mean look just just to be a bit like self-critical so
I'm not a climate scientist right I think I don't I don't annoy just a stop
right so like when I when I say I believe like human climate change is
real that's an act of faith on my part yeah right and so like yeah my suspicion
is that that encapsulate like the human thought process like ultimately like
there's something about like deferring to whatever is the default belief of the
community that I feel that I belong to you that's like the main mode of
operation even when we think that it yields results that we find are good right so you know I'm also part of this
more like progressive anti-racist you know feminist and agenda but you know you might say
that's I'm like this because those are the ideas that are available in my eco
Miche I'm just you know conforming to whatever is so I think the the person
who articulates this most beautifully is Joseph Henrich I really I really like I
really really like Joe he's great he's uh he's based at Harvard he's like a an evolutionary biologist
anthropologist and he works on the self domestication of humans and so he says
well basically the the those very mechanisms that enable us to perform
like these large-scale feats of incredible coordination right the things
that make us like agreeable and able to cooperate with one another are also the things that like you know
make us susceptible to fascism and to like authoritarian dictatorships were
agreeable we just go with things you know like they're not the typical Nazi wasn't like a raging racist yeah
you know they were just like quote-unquote good people just trying not to rock the boat and just going with
whatever the and so you know that's really what like I think it's too easy for us to say like oh well clearly you
know like we're on the right side of this because our beliefs happen to line up with whatever is the case in reality
the cognitive operations that I go through to say like well you know I
believe in man-made human-made climate change are essentially the same is like
an empty box are going like oh well you know like I like I can't myself verify
that this is the case mmm I don't know the science like ah my my my opinion
rests on this division of labor but the yeah so I'm not particularly optimistic
yeah look I've never thought about it in that way and you've just made me a little bit more pessimistic like I've
never really thought about like that and we are like I just his face faith-based
yeah yeah yeah because I have looked at them I like riotous assume the experts are
experts in ER and just less trusted but everyone assumes that they're experts or experts right yeah that's the thing
that's that's what's sharing a generative model is about but at the same time like there's like that's that's all that's true but then when you
think about climate change when you think about that we are on this bounded planet like you know it's a closed system in many ways and that we are
there's like eight billion of us a lot of us are using I think the value the
number is like 30 times our basal metabolic rates you're like for us to live the lives that we live we need 30 times amount of energy our bodies needs
like what do you think about that it kind of makes sense that things might be heating up you know like you don't need
to like really but I'm not denying climate change no I I know you know I'm like I don't think you need to be like
on this progressive side of things to actually just go through that line of reasoning do I critical ultimately the
the big filter is natural selection right so we can have the beliefs that we
want and we can have the generative models that we want but like if we're too off we're gonna die
yeah and that's that's the bottleneck at the end of the day and that's also why I'm not super like optimistic because
like the the way that these shifts happen typically is massive die-off yeah
I mean like that's how generative models are not evolved a right the same way that everything else ends up involving
like you know whether its cultural selection or natural selection like you know the maladaptive beliefs end up like
causing negative consequences to their hammers and then not spread into the
future and so like yeah I agree like you know I I think I personally I
think I have good reason to believe in that make climate change and I also
think I have good reason to think that if we don't take it seriously as a factual matter of affairs and there will
be negative consequences but my fear is just that like even if I know this my motive justification is not
fundamentally different and the one employed by people who believe in chemtrails and you know where I gave fog
stuff like you know you heard Alex if you didn't watch that podcast with
him Jurgen and no not the whole Robert I
mean it's ridiculous it's ridiculous to fundamentally though like the difference
is that I have I have more epistemic tools up my sleeve right I'm a scientist
able I don't know I don't have the exact analytic tools that are used in climate
science but I do I do know like a story out of anecdotes from you
know rigorous they have kind of reviews of evidence but like fundamentally
though like it's it's sort of about it's all about like the the kind of the so
Joe Henrik calls them creds credibility enhancing displays you know it's it is
that there's an economy of authority you
know humans are the the only mammal species with a prestige system that's
evolved independently of the dominant system right so like what was that system I just cut out a vestige okay
prestige so Preston he's just a kind of freely conferred power right whereas like dominance is you know you listen to
me because I'm gonna smack you if you don't write like prestige is the kind of thing that like you know Joe says the
the the the top top climber at the base
camp of the Himalaya right like everyone wants to climb with this person yeah because it just so happens she's the
best right she knows how to you know go up the mountain she knows the path she knows what did you like the he's
socially but it's it's like it's not that she's conferred yeah right but
there's an economy of these of authority like in in almost every society there's
a series of ritualized cues that indicate who is the knowing cast right so like you know scientists we're you
know sorrows and doctors have their stethoscopes and teachers profs I mean
less and less maybe like in the North American context but like you know profs will often dress up you know people in
positions of power indicate not just power but like people in positions of epistemic Authority reliably indicate
with like Ecology's of cues that they have this Authority means are just very
sensitive to these cues you know we so it's it's you know it's it's what the
Milgram experiments for example so I mean it's people deferred I mean I don't
know if Milgram still works anymore wasn't good I think it's a bit dodgy it was yeah but anyway like there are these
experiments from social psychology that tend to show that people just defer to whatever they think is a source of
authority and I think that's more germane to human cognition than
strenuous putting into question of whether the psychology of queues
actually reflects something so I just think it's moral luck at the end of the
day if you and I are on the right side of this kind of factual matter it's it's
not it's not because the vinegar true that we cultivated we just happen to be in the right at the semuc meteor that
allows us to make the right kind of inferences yeah but so my my fear though
is that like making these kind of fact-based inferences takes a lot of energy and there are there are much
fewer people who are able to make them than people who are like able to you know subscribe on YouTube and start a
channel about chemtrails and whatever so like I mean on the whole I'm not I I
don't know what's gonna happen I mean III don't see any reason to be optimistic
to be blunt oh well we can do our best
and see what happens I mean having said that like I I think that the kinds of
tools that we're developing are giving us a better grip so for example like you know this
this generate shared generative model business allows us to understand the
Constitution right and the maintenance of epistemic communities in a robust way
that might be amenable we hope to modeling into like experiment and so you
know it it may be that like by studying the ways in which humans reason right
and reason on the basis of like credibility enhancing displays right an
arbitrary between different sources of epistemic Authority and so on it may be that like you know through that process
mmm you know none of its age dependent just because I don't think we have much time
it may be so yeah I someone that I really admire in the literature
she's a theoretical neuroscientist and neuro imager she's with the neuro
imaging department at King's College and she has this great model of how
basically the the parameter range of your generative model becomes more and more rigid as you grow older and that's
that's not because your brain is like efficient it's that it's adaptive I mean presumably when you're middle-aged
you should assuming like a relatively stable structure in the environment you
should have less to learn than someone who's like half your age you know that there is a rigidify of the generative
models that's age dependent I mean my own my own fear has to do with like the
the rapid generational shift so like you know the boomers that gets so mulling
maligned in the you know just in the media you know just abused and
everything will be they grew up in another world yeah we're like you know journalism was you know like everyone
had the same everyone had the same informational environment right liking right you just wasn't precisely because
there were like three sources of information right so yeah so whereas people I don't know exactly how you are
under 30 and so like I I grew up with the internet and with the assumption
actually like part of what it is to have a valid epistemic process is to bet you
know the source of the information where you're getting this whereas like if you grew up in that it's all to it it was
like you look at something and it's like this is oh yeah but exactly but if you grew up in an ecology where there
are three sources and information you know like the the news at five you know
your local journal and whatever your big-city journal is like then then your
relation to sources of information and the very process by which you bet your own beliefs is going to be radically
different yeah so it may be what we're seeing now maybe like I mean you know
and I don't want to make it only into a generational thing I mean there are a young conspiracy theorists but it has to
do with like you know exploiting the basic kind of you know mechanisms for
attributing epistemic Authority I mean you know you'll notice like Trump does this all the time you know like he
prefaced is his sentences with material that would enhance his credibility in
certain communities right so saying like you know I'm the best at Nenana no one
understands X better than I do like the these these cues work in a community
were typically the people who say this are the people who know right now so if you grew up and you were uncultured in a
community where you know people who signal in this way typically are right about things and it's not surprising
that you'll end up like you know adhering for this and I don't only want to make it into a right-wing thing I
mean I think oh it's on the both sides for sure for sure it's it's just we live
in such interesting times you know Michael I think we're just see right now is self-righteousness self-righteousness
yeah on everyone's side I think yeah it's just you know from a philosophical
point of view I come from this tradition called hermeneutics so I mean my
favorite philosopher is uh this-this-this philosopher called gadamer yeah gadamer's philosophy is a
philosophy of interpretation so hermeneutics is sort of a corrective to phenomenology phenomenology says let's
start from the first person lived experience and its immediacy hermeneutics says there's no such thing
as immediate first-person experience all experience is all always already mediated by structures of interpretation
but anyway I don't want to dwell on that but I say this because gadamer says beautifully somewhere like the starting
point of my philosophy is that my interlocutor could be correct right like
I might be wrong it's about interpretation and finding a common interpretation and I think that's
been completely evacuated like the discussion is about showing the other
person why they are wrong and showing people on our side why we are so virtuous right like the you know we're
really going to stick it to the lids or you know just like finger-pointing and
calling people or whatever isn't as hot today like it's like it's it's only it's
only epistemic this talk that we're having this discussion is only epistemic for show it's not really about epistemic
it's about confirming what I believe right and so so telling you who disagree
with me that you have to be wrong ultimately right and yeah it's it's it's
and about showing you know others that you know we're we're also valid epistemic agents you know I guess like
if that makes me think and you have to thank you for a while and you know I'm
just echoing what I've heard a lot of other people say but humility from you
know a scientific standpoint from the standpoint of policy but also in our own interactions with each other is has
never been more important right like that we can learn from the person that we're talking with or arguing with yeah
so that our actions like we actually don't know what may happen in the world we don't know how bad the current of
Irish could be we don't know whether or not our climate change models are actually correct and Ravin that we do
not know we need to be carried to be extra careful because things could go better than we think but things could also go a lot worse yeah
precisely and you know we have to be open to and again I'm not saying that we have to listen to these crazy denialists
who you know cherry-pick their data and who are obviously not like engaging in
the same kind of scientific process that we are but like I especially mean like moral certainties you know I mean it may
be that the way that we see the world even even our our you know most deeply cherished values maybe they're off you
know to a certain extent and and I think that it's the it's the
self-righteousness of everyone involved in these political conversations that
makes it and you know I'm a many minds about this because on the same time you know at the same time if someone's
position is that like we should exterminate whatever you know a group of people because of whatever you know
reason and that also doesn't float you know like I I don't think that
we so it's it's it's all sorts of complicated and I don't have any other dancers I just look at the problem
honestly yeah well that's the first step to solving it right mmm yeah understanding it I mean the one thing we
didn't discuss is is what the approach can't do so yeah there's good reason to
think that nature you know life if life exists right if life is a useful concept
if we don't eliminate it from our ontology there's a good reason to think that life isn't a non-equilibrium steady
state process it isn't it isn't like the so like evolution isn't going anywhere
right if life is this open-ended kind of thing that's like a tree yeah exactly
yeah and and and it works on a process of drift which is not predictable you
know like so I mean natural selection works there is variation selection retention right so
like that process is not so the the
technical term is ergodic so basically everybody mean yeah average yeah yeah
yeah okay so like the so you know like so if you think of the space of all
possible states of the system like an ergodic system means that there's some density towards which the system
eventually converges right such that on average so that the average of your
measures will converge to a measure of your average yeah because there is a
density at the end of the day right okay there's reason to think and in fact like I'm working with people who are showing
this experimental II there's reason to think that at several relevant scales there is a non-equilibrium steady state
density one of the easy demonstrations of this is that you I assume I mean maybe you have a different physiology
for climbing but like you're roughly the same height from day to day right your your your blood pressure is roughly in
the same or in the same neighborhood you know you're all that you have these
these states that you revisit frequently you know the such that you can say that
there's something like ass phenotype all right that you returned to characteristically but evolution itself
is an open-ended process that might not have such a like an endpoint right so so
like right now the the formulation is in terms of non-equilibrium steady state
systems but it doesn't extend to non equilibrium non steady state systems so
so the ways right given the time scale we're not non steady it's really like it
depends on your temporal scale in scale at which this doesn't apply yeah yeah
yeah and in fact like it may be that like the the more socially interesting
stuff that you're interested in can't interests by this framework for precisely that reason what basically if
if the attractor doesn't exist yet there's nothing you can do from
variational e like there's nothing to converge to mmm well sort of right I
agree there's no there's no point of convergence however one tenant that you could say is the need to survive right
and a part of that diversity of approaches so well so you can still get
something out of it so you can say like there are like you can say there are something like different attractors that
are competing right so there's the liberal the progressive and the conservative kind of attractors those
sort of competing for where the overall trajectory but you might say that but look like what I want to say is
something like well you can use the current formulation to model something like feudal friends but not France
during like the Revolution and the terror when they're there just isn't a clear attractor like so the entire
approach rests on being able to write down this non-equilibrium steady-state density like this the phenotype if
you're able to characterize the phenotype then you gave us this effect so that's their problem right like life
is a process it's not discrete it's like so you're constantly becoming I mean and I I didn't the way I think about life
and death more specifically is that we don't really die like we like life is
just about information creation consolidation and propagation and we are just apart we're just passing the baton
right like we live on through our genetic code but also through the culture the ideas possessing I couldn't
agree more yeah yeah all I'm saying is that like you know and and as an advocate of the
approach work I also want to hope that there's a way to extend the the formalism to non steady state systems
but if you're asking me like what can't this do because it does seem like it can do almost everything well so what Kant did do the historical
change mmm can't do it right now like III for principled reasons this isn't
like an accident but like so you know the approach hasn't yet been applied to the
formation of epistemic communities that's not a principled limitation it's just that it hasn't been done yet
yeah so that's what we're doing well if this is hammer and there's so many nails now right exactly but like this may be a
principle limitation it may be that this kind of approach can is only conceivable
for non-equilibrium steady-state system and certainly the current mathematical
formulation even in Carl's like totally integrative 20/20 like monograph that
really contains like the whole approach even there like it's formulated in terms
of non equilibrium steady state so it may be that like and this is what's frustrating for me as a scientist like
maybe the most important questions are not can't be addressed in this kind of framework because at least the most
ethically important questions may be those have to do with when the attractor hasn't consolidated maybe I don't know
or if there even is one right like it like that's I think I've on the promise of like ethics in general it's like well
is there an objective good and like what are we moving towards and like I think in a way it's kind of the wrong question
I don't think there is an objective good like if you take it fueling materials the materialist approach like we have
just like minimizing entropy locally and trying to do the best as possible as we
move up scales and when I say we I mean life in general right and that morality is emergent and like I think like
obviously we'd say that like that which is more complex so that you know like life is good like if you think of the
world with life or no life we'd say that life is good we're obviously biased but I don't think there's anything wrong
with like to say there's this that there's no like if you take this
perspective that we have just kind of emerged from soup and morality has come with it and that there may I believe
that there would be things that are that all forms of life intelligent life would think would deemed to be of moral worth
so you can think of that as objectively moral but like to see there as being objective morality extricated from life
I just I don't think that makes any sense you know I I agree and that's consonant with the framework that we're
too since from from our vantage point morality is just encoded in a specific
kind of shared generative model you know so so my question so let's say there's
two worlds right and I know that I have to choose between one and I've got a
flourishing ecosystem bamas only rainforest or I've got a shitty one like a desert right I just say one of them
has to exist which one would exist everyone would choose the Amazon
rainforest one not everyone if you're a Bedouin you'll prefer the desert yeah but I think like they are I think
on average and I think that is important right because it depends on what you've like you're adapted to like I think that
we are like we have moral intuitions that point us in the direction of that which promotes order and survival and
the increasing and here's the rub like that is defined in terms of the
non-equilibrium steady-state density so you're still not out of the woods it's not objective like the the good is just
defined in terms of like and like our
body's adapted this so I'm a Canadian like you know when it's five degrees Celsius outside I can go outside in a
t-shirt and I'm totally fine like but I don't handle the heat well like when I
went to Australia Jesus Christ like I went in February and Sydney just kicked
my ass like I just can't handle this 40 degree heat so I lived in Malaysia right and I'm like you I can I can handle a cult
but the heat just ruins me so I had a sweating problem and I just realized I was just in their own country well but
your body does adapt I mean like after several months of this you start sweating less and that's what I mean
though is like the third you know it's all about the complete package of priors
that you embody so there really isn't the way to say well this is good and this is bad I mean you know think of
like a preference for spicy foods I mean it's even or sad Oh masochism as a sex
thing I mean it's it's just it's just the case that like you know there's no objective kind of mapping
it's just whatever is you know like whatever is available and whatever can
lead to like a targeted configuration I mean the the bit that I kind of skipped over for the social stuff is that like
what's sharing a generative model allows you to do at the end since you're sharing all your expectations is to
arrive at the same target configuration so all of these multi scale models they
rest on the idea that a bunch of components sharing a generative model if they engage in individual inference they
can still reach this kind of target configuration so that's how all of this morphogenesis cellular differentiation
stuff inactive in family and when I met Carl what made my nose bleed initially
was him telling me you know the exact same mathematics that we use in the morphogenesis stuff you could use in the
social stuff because it's it's it's sharing a generative model it's just that in one case the generative model is
a metaphor for a shared genetic and epigenetic code like when what you're
modeling is like cellular differentiation the genetic code is a shared generative model that tells every
cell well what kind of thing should you expect sentence given the kind of cell
that you are right so the the same the very same mathematical framework applies
to social dynamics it's just that rather than you know what kind of you know
intracellular signalling you're expecting it's what kind of social cues do I expect to see right but it's the
same idea yeah yeah why is it a target configuration by sharing a generative mall and the twist for the whole
multiscale story is that like the this can be reiterated infinitely so your cells share expectations that cell
networks share expectations organ networks you know organisms
yeah mall or social groups like the family unit larger social groups like a like a community like all of these can
be cast as like successive recursively nested
of a system that at each level share the same generative model and they're all
doing the same thing example is a cell that doesn't write it was like a cancer
cell doesn't have the same generative model as your other cells because it's genetic material has been altered you
know so that's really the perspective from which I'm coming to understand like it's also why I'm so pessimistic to be
honest with you I mean the thing that you see is that you need to share a generative model to for there to be a
target configuration right like the the the share generative model is what
induces the non-equilibrium steady state at the superordinate level the fact that
we all share the same generative model means that our our behavior will look as
if it's converging toward some kind of phenotype at the high dose that's how you get cool like self-organization that
scales like that exactly okay that's what dropping me drew me into the free energy principle initially so we
need that I just static global like I had a planetary and I own now yeah but then the question is can we construct
the generative model that's both complex enough to like capture this kind of you
know that the model is complex enough to capture the complexity of the phenomenon but also transmissible you know like one
of the big problems that we're having right now in the approach is that like this all rests on like this high-flying
one of the things that people don't get about this is that I get builds on quantum mechanics it builds on classical
mechanics it builds on thermodynamics so it's much more complicated than quantum
mechanics so like you know there's there's a transmission issue that gets
in the way at some point because like not everyone can be expected to like
assimilate that level look like that's why I wanted to have this conversation because like I'm I can like read stuff
and understand it like generally like looks like I'm the genius but I sometimes I can read stuff and sort of
get picture but this stuff is a bit impenetrable like I don't have a mathematics mathematical background and yeah I mean
unfortunately like the math is required yeah it's not like it's not like a gloss
it's that like it's sort of like look if I ask you you know bees make honey combs
right yeah why are honey combs shaped the way they are as strength and
space-filling yes precisely it's space-filling it's that hexagons are
like one of the one of the geometrically optimal ways to tessellate or to
completely cover a two-dimensional space so in this case it's a bit of math that
explains the behavior is that like you need to appeal to the mathematical fact
that heggs hexagons can completely tessellate a 2d surface and this can be generalized into three dimensions right
like you need that piece of math to explain the behavior of these so what asks where I need to know right here I
mean the only way to do that is to like really slowly go through the literature I mean I've been doing this like I've
just been doing active in different stuff basically since 2014 and I'm still
learning but I mean like you know the
really it's a multidisciplinary approach like there are people from computer science there are people from physics
there are people from philosophy and at from anthropology and like the full picture is bigger than any any one
person with their tools set can address well max well I think I've taken a
decent chunk of your time today sir they carry in your f oh yeah yeah
it's been lots of fun um if people want to find out about your work keep up to date with it where should they go online
how can they find you online well I mean I'm on research gay and
academia.edu but all of my research basically yeah essentially everything
I've ever written is available either as a preprint or open access actually the
vast majority my publications are available up in access so I like to say that my hockey card is my Google Scholar account yeah
yeah really I like that I like a Twitter account if you want i i'm also on
twitter i Twitter's my public kind of academic thing so like I keep I keep
everyone up to date like when this is released all OH I'll advertise it on my Twitter so yeah Twitter is the best way
to keep like in the loop but like all of my work is accessible on my Google
Scholar account like you'll find links to all of the manuscripts for free so
has been wonderful okay that's been good cuz I mean is research for this right
it's nice actually yes I mean you know we we we we are definitely not in favor
of paywalls and stuff so yeah all of my stuff is accessible so yeah yeah thank
you for thank you for the invitation honestly Sam this has been very very enjoyable yeah that's a good fun it's
been good fun thanks for taking the time and uh yeah I'm sure we'll do it again sometime soon yeah I'd love to and
whenever you want me back it was really a pleasure so oh so uh yeah let's do it
