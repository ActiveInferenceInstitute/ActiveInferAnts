Chris Fields: Non-Reductive Explanation
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weyzSDmoobI

so next we've got Chris Fields um Chris is a faculty member at our Allen Discovery Center he's going to tell us
about non-reductive explanation okay uh thank you Mike and and thanks
Thomas for uh letting me make some brief remarks about this kind of ad hoc
um I wanted to give this presentation
um after hearing Richard's presentation yesterday and then engaging in some some
discussion of that presentation from from Richard uh last night over dinner
and uh just briefly I want to talk about the structures the structure of
non-reductive explanation and use the free energy Principle as a particular
example of a kind of non-reductive approach to science
and to to start I'll just say that I think as scientists and as the broader
Community we've been exposed to a persistent mythology
that originates really in the 1930s with people like Carl Hempel
that science has to be reductive
and therefore science is reductive it is because it has to be not the other way
around and the we therefore in a in a way give lip
service to science being reductive uh even though we don't think it is and
and even though it isn't in fact and and I actually think that most science isn't reductive
but even though it isn't reductive uh people talk about it as if it is
reductive even the people who are doing it because they think that's what they're supposed to do
and so when we think about uh Richard's a slide which I didn't have time to
actually replicate uh and I'm not sure that I could replicate in quite as Artful a way that he does where he shows
science leading us into this kind of abyss of reductive meaninglessness or whatever
I think this is a construct that in a sense has been
projected onto science by philosophers and scientists had bought into it even
against their best instincts so I I'm using slides that are put together for
um a talk that I'm giving in a few weeks for a Quantum information Theory class
that I'm doing online so there's a little bit of background that I'll include here that it's just
background to bring you up to speed on some of the vocabulary so I'm I'm doing everything in the context of
a very simple setting in which we use quantum information Theory
and the the extremely simple setting is one in which there are two systems you
can call them agents if you want to I I always think of them that way that are exchanging information across some
mutual boundaries and these two agents make up the entire
universe of Interest so we can treat them as an isolated system we can treat the joint to agent system as an isolated
system so each of the agents is obviously an open system it's interacting with the other agent and the
interactions defined at this particular boundary and the agents are always called Alice and Bob in quantum theory
and we were able to formulate a couple of years ago uh working with Mike and
and Carl and some other people um the free energy principle in this
super simple Quantum information Theory theoretic setting
and the the way that we ended up being able to formulate it is that
two interacting systems will tend to behave in a way that
familiarly allows them to maximize their predictive power
what are they trying to predict they're trying to predict the information that they'll receive across this boundary
uh how do they do that they do that by mutually evolving toward a shared set of
observation and action capabilities which amounts to sharing a language in
some informal sense that could be made more formal but we won't worry about how to do that
now to the extent that agents perfectly share
their observation and action capabilities so that they in fact perfectly reproduce
each other's inputs uh it turns out that they they they are
then by definition no longer uh conditionally independent so they're
entangled oh now what that means is that the free
energy principle is actually a classical um approximation of the principle of
unitarity which is just the principle of information and conservation which is the core principle of quantum theory so
the free energy principle when it's expressed in quantum theory becomes a
classical limit if you will of this very general principle that in fact defines
as quantum theory so that's kind of nice and that it it tells us how the free energy principle
which was originally formulated in neuroscience and then classical physics fits into
uh this deeper if you will theoretical framework
and a nice outcome of this is that um
constraints on observation and in particular the constraint that one can't
deploy all of one's operate one's observational or action capabilities
simultaneously that constraint uh
gives you effective non-commutability between your
observations and actions so you can observe and act this way or
you can observe an act this way but you can't do both as soon as you're in that situation it
induces compartmentalization because if I can't do both at the same time I can't regard them as as the same
operation which is what they would be if they commuted uh and so I have to draw a boundary
between them and that enforces internal classical communication it enforces time
delays such as Adam was showing us are very critical and so it effectively
creates a multi-component agent and induces these new internal
communication pathways and one outcome of that is you automatically get some sort of control
system which allocates free energy resources to the different components so
you get something that looks a bit like attention so this is all just background
for the theoretical setting what I really want to talk about is explanation
strategies and ask the question what's the
difference between reductionist theories and scale-free theories and the the fep
is a I think canonical example now of a scale free Theory so reductive theories
are all based on this idea that what little things are doing
explains what big things are doing and
that uh because the behavior of the little things
explains the behavior of the big things the behavior of the big things is in
some sense emergent or epiphenomenal or not very interesting or or whatever or
it doesn't matter or what have you so this is the reasoning that gives rise to
uh Richard's descent into the abyss right that what we actually see at our
scale doesn't really make any difference because what's really going on is Adam's
the boy or something like that or Quantum fields or who knows what and so the core assumption that any
reductionist approach is making is that there is some fundamental scale
and at that fundamental scale what's happening is interesting
and that there are a bunch of fundamental laws or Dynamics or mechanisms or something that are defined
down at that fundamental scale and that once you're given that you've got everything else
so that's how reductive theories work and the philosophically precise
formulation of reductionism is that there are actually laws of nature
that uh allow you to infer from this microscale behavior of to
macroscope behavior and by saying laws of nature I mean not just an inferential
procedure that we came up with but rather an actual law that's been
there since the the Big Bang so nature itself does this inference to the
macro scale and there's nothing we can do about it so let me contrast that
with a scale free Theory so in a skill free Theory
um what that what it means to say that the theory is scale free is that exactly the
same Theory applies at multiple scales so uh for example
taking the free energy Principle as an example little things behave according to the free energy principle and big
things behave according to the free energy principle and I can write down the free energy principle and that's it
all I have to do now is change what the variables refer to and I can have a
micro scale description of mesoscale description a macro scale description they're all exactly the same Dynamics
applying at different scales so what does that tell us about
systems as opposed to Dynamics well we've got these macro scale entities
we've got a bunch of micro scale entities there's got to be some sort of
relationship between them and the only plausible relationship is
is some kind of relationship that we can bundle under
the term implementation fairly broadly conceived so we know for example that our body is
are full of cells and those cells are executing some sorts
of behaviors and we know that somehow what the cells are doing is is implementing something
about how we're behaving of course I'm stealing this term from computer science and we'll come back to computer science
to Define it that I'm relying right now on a kind of intuitive notion of what
implementation means that that oh
these parts are behaving in ways that um
in some sense manifest in the behavior that we see at the macroscale but their
behavior is not our Behavior their environment is not our environment
uh so on their experience and experiencing and thinking about a
completely different environment than the environment we're experiencing and thinking about in free energy terms so
the motto for scale free theories is As Above So Below
whatever theory that you come up with to describe the macro scale is going to be the theory the micro
scale and vice versa so what matters then if we go back to
this picture I showed you at first of Agents interacting across a boundary
what distinguishes the scale is just how densely information is encoded on this
boundary if you want to think of the boundary as a as a spatial structure it's not
necessary to do that the theory is in fact very compatible
with the idea that space is something that emerges on the boundary
and doesn't exist any place else so it's it's very consistent with a
picture in which there's no such thing as Observer independent classical information
and and no such thing as Observer independent space-time that if you think about the boundary as having a scale
then we can treat it as an energy scale a length scale a time scale
or any combination of those so if you think just in terms of physics you get a picture like this where you
have the Planck energy which is very large much much higher than we can achieve with say the LHC and it
corresponds to the Planck length which is very small and if you have that kind of encoding at
that density then the interacting objects or black holes by definition
uh and you can decrease the energy scale which corresponds to increasing the
length scale and um so our our natural scale is about a
meter in size and so our our Natural Energy scale is
this very small energy 10 to the minus 5 electron volts which
is tiny tiny tiny and if you compare that to say the
energy scale of visual photons um visual photons are 10 to the fifth times
that they're about an electron volt so so it's no surprise that that light seems very energetic to us because it's
it's much much larger than the energy associated with the scale of beings that
are our size so so scale is this thing that we can
manipulate and if we think about a scale free Theory it's just a theory that applies anywhere in this picture
so you know we're all very familiar with the picture like this this is a classic
reductionist Theory it says look all the action here is
on the the left hand extreme the very initial instant of the Big Bang
that's occurring within roughly the plank time and everything happens then
and then we have this inflationary period that just makes things bigger and then
um Things become a little bit bigger and more diffuse and there's not even light
at that point and then we start to get the formation of atoms and and
Elementary particles and then atoms and then conglomerations of atoms on and on and on and on and all of that physics
has to be encoded in this initial instant of of creation of whatever you want and
so people construct bouncing cosmologies and things like that where these sorts
of instances are repeated over and over again and you get different physical constants in each one and on and on but
all of this is a reductive picture right all of this is saying the action in the universe is at this
tiny scale and that's all that really matters everything else is emergence where emergence just says some process
happened but how that process unfolds is actually embedded in these initial
conditions so let's contrast that with a kind of
explanation that's truly scale free it doesn't look anything like this
and to to do that contrast I have to draw a picture um
so let's think of this physical system that the Observer Alice
is observing she's observing the state of something that we've called Bob and that state
evolves by some physical process but Alice hasn't seen that evolving
state Alice sees what Bob writes on her
boundary which is this script B so Bob might write on the boundary using
some procedure that I've labeled procedure one in which case Alice sees some encoding
uh that Bob is ridden and it evolves Through Time and uh the the blue upper Arrow here is
just the process by which Bob writes on the boundary that's his action process
which Alice can't see she just sees the battery and Alice can come up with a theory of
how the boundary evolves and that's going to be some sort of Markov process for example because we're
talking about mapping some bit array into some other bit array some data into some other data so she can develop a
theory that's at the scale of this encoding so that can happen but it also can be
the case that Bob uses some other process to write on the boundary at a
different scale with a different scale of encoding which produces a different
bid array that has a different dimension and that bid array can also evolve
Through Time and Alice can construct a theory of how
that bit array evolves and now the question becomes how does
Alice relate these two theories say a very high density theory that
would correspond to micro scale events at a very low density theory that would
correspond to macroscale events well Alice has to come up with a map
that says objects at this micro scale have some sort of relationship
to objects that this macro scale because I'm observing the same boundary
these data are being produced by the same process but their data at different scales
and that map that map between scales
um we would like to remain constant otherwise otherwise the world really
doesn't make sense at all and that map is essentially a semantic
map because it relates what looked like objects and processes at one scale to
what look like objects and processes in another scale so I will claim that this process of
looking at multiple distinct scale
representations of the behavior of one system and developing semantic Maps between
them is extremely familiar to us and in fact we we deal with that mapping
all the time because this is exactly
what we do in computer science it's exactly the process of observing a
device you know something like that and observing it at multiple scales
and looking at different mappings from some underlying physics that we don't
observe right we're not constantly looking at our laptops with
electron microscopes or the LHC uh we're not examining the microscale
behavior we're only comparing different kinds of macroscale behavior even if
we're looking at the relationship between what's happening in the transistors and what's happening on the
screen those are both macro scale descriptions and when we think about programming
languages when we think about compilers for example we're building exactly these
kinds of semantic Maps between these representations of some underlying
dynamics that are defined at different scales so computer science itself gives us a
model of non-reductive explanation um
you know what this allows me to do is very different from what uh
understanding the circuitry allows me to do for example Mike was telling a story
that I've heard him tell before about an applicant for a software engineering
position who only talks about electrons uh this is not the person who's going to
be a very good programmer unless of course they're a god of some kind but
we're not interested in the behaviors or theories generated by college we're only interested in behaviors interiors that
are generated by observers like cuffs so this is this is how multi multi-scale
interpretive theory always works it's always a
process of constructing semantic Maps so we can ask now about
what's the relationship between some Tower of semantic maps that
we build to understand how things relate across scales and
here's a the kind of tower that you might get in biology if you're applying the free energy
principle at multiple scales from the scale of interacting
molecular Pathways within a cell up to the scale of ecosystems kind of
colliding in some biosphere and I would Advance the hypothesis at least
that for biological systems the relationship between these scales in
a sense is trivial that not only are we executing the free
energy principle at each scale but the relationships between scales are
are even formal equivalence so that we would expect to see
uh things like cooperation competition coercion
deception Etc at any scale from the scale of of pathways
uh certainly at the scale of cells organisms social groups
and even perhaps ecosystems so it would make sense in a picture like
this to to do kind of what Adam Illustrated in the previous talk which is to apply
these sociological concepts to for example cell biology
you know why not take this cell biology in terms of communities of Agents who
want to communicate with each other but who may not quite want to reveal everything you may have different levels of trust
or who may actually want to take control and tell other cells what to do
and and Mike and I've explored these sorts of ideas in various papers
um but I think it's at least worth entertaining the hypothesis that
um in biology we have this sort of not just scale free Behavior but in a
sense metascale free Behavior that even the semantic maps are scale
free so I'll just close with this comment
that if physics and computer science are are actually the same thing
then our job as physicists
is to um build a physics that describes the
behavior of physics physicists and in particular build of physics that
explicitly describes the processes of observation and action
and this is why I think Quantum information theory is such a huge advance and why I think it will actually
change the way quantum theory is is viewed and used and
maybe finally break the hold of shut up and calculate on physics
um because it it forces us to come to terms with interaction
and observation being the same thing and having the same discussion
and of course it exposes us immediately to the gentleman depicted at the bottom
uh who reminds us that consistency and completeness are in interesting theories
not actually compatible uh and I I think an open area of
exploration and one thing that a colleague and I'm working on is to what extent are interesting theories are not
soluble in in girdle's sense so thank you I just wanted to make those
remarks kind of in response to what we've heard so far in this meeting [Applause]
thanks a lot Chris I really enjoyed that really important points I think um
I'll start with a comment which follows from the the comment I had also about Adam's um Talk which is on the use of of
terms from sociology or psychology and so on which tend to be quite loaded and
which uh you know you might intend a particular way but listeners or readers
might take uh another way that isn't licensed by the actual things you're looking at and I think there's
a tendency when we see the same type of behavior at different skills to say that
the thing at the either the high scale the psychology and sociology that we see is just this mechanistic uh thing
happening right it's sort of reduction or deflation of the the concepts like belief or song or we ascribe beliefs and
Desires in a kind of anthropomorphic way to simple systems and I think an alternative to that rather than saying a
is a type of b or B is a type of a is to just say A and B are both instantiations of C in a different way
so it gets Beyond I think that concerns uh that misunderstandings that
can arise from either the deflation or the inflation of um things that at either end
um so that's the comment the question is whether um to get past the idea of of causal
comprehensiveness or completeness at the at the lowest levels of supposedly the fundamental levels of uh forces and
particles of fields or whatever you need to have indeterminacy at that level and that so that's the I I
think that's true I don't think you can get away from reductionism if determinism at that level is is true but
I know not everybody thinks that's true uh okay uh I'll let I'll actually
comment on both of your comments uh one is uh natural languages are obviously
necessary uh but they're also a terrible uh hindrance to communication
and mathematics is nicer from a from an ambiguity standpoint
but it it also raises similar semantic problems
um which for example is evidenced by the measurement problem in quantum theory which is a semantic problem
so I think I think we're just stuck with this and yes we can we can wriggle around and try to get around it and try
to say things in ways that are very clear but uh language is
um deeply insufficient for communication
so that said um to your question in indeterminacy
I am among the camp that views all uncertainty as Observer
relative um and I you know I actually go farther
than that and claim that all classical information is observed a relative
so in that sense I see
uncertainty is being fundamental
in a certain precise sense which is that and let me go back to this
first picture actually if you have a system
its Dynamics can be perfectly deterministic
uh its Dynamics can be perfectly information conservant
so if you if you think of a universe which is closed so it's not interacting
with anything so there's no information flowing into it and there's no information flowing out of it
then that's heaven right that's a place where nothing ever happens
um so there's no uncertainty but there's no observers either
as soon as you slice it and you say okay I have I've defined a
boundary and there's there's one system on one side of the boundary and one system on the other side of the boundary
then those two observers have deep uncertainty
and not only do they have deep uncertainty about the future they're extremely powerful no-go
theorems that immediately apply so if if you have this situation with
Allison Bob then it's easy to show that Alice can't
determine Bob's Dimension she can't even tell how many degrees of freedom are out there
she can't determine the dimension of her boundary she can't determine whether she has a
conditionally independent state so Alice doesn't even know that she's not
entangled with Bob so it's it's not just a matter of
statistical uncertainty now there's there's deep deep epistemic uncertainty
so uh the answer about uncertainty is is yes and no it's it's it's fundamental
and and completely observe a relative at least in my view
I'm great so so let me add one thing to that lots and lots of theories especially in
the popular press appeal to Randomness as some sort of
explanation Randomness is never an explanation of anything in in this View
there's no such thing as objective randomness thanks Chris saying I'm gonna over here
um first of all I disagree with that and I'm looking forward to talking about that last statement because I think there is ontological uncertainty and I
think it's prevalent um but that's a conversation for another day uh I you know I've thought about the
renormalization group I've thought about that theory a little bit and I I admit to fundamental ignorance it's very hard
stuff uh so I'm gonna maybe misrepresent it a little bit it seems to me that if I understand it
correctly when you apply renormalization Theory what you're saying is they're a class of
um if you want systems that can all be understood according to the same kind of
general rule framework um but there are many many such classes
and uh certainly not all systems can be renormalized to all other systems
so while I appreciate the um
the goal of trying to find classes of systems that across scales of time and
space are fundamentally similar according to whatever you know
block diagonalization you're going to apply um that set those those sets of sets are
very specific so I guess my question is what's the you know the sort of what what explanatory
power do we get out of first of all making the statement that there is scale and variance
as a general statement and secondly where how do you do the work to figure
out which systems are Con well conduced to scale
invariant explanations without doing something like the hard work of
mathematicalizing them all and testing against like arenormalization groups so
just and I'll end there but also to recommend a philosopher called Robert batterman who's done a lot of work on
this and and um his interest his interesting sort of most introductory stuff is to say that
there are certain things where the mesoscale is what matters so for example steel beams what you
really need to look at is the um is the domains of atoms and anything smaller
than that doesn't matter so there are sort of when you do multi-scale modeling you often find that there are scales
that matter and that they're different from other scales and I think some of your work actually Mike on information
Theory also indicates that in time length scales there are some places where you really get more bang for your
buck by looking at a particular scale than trying to make a kind of a scale
independent argument oh yo I'll I'll be like Mark here I'll I'll
also say they're they're two responses here um response one is I completely agree with
you there's no substitute for actually doing the work
uh so I'm I'm trying to to describe here what it would be like to have a scale
Independence a scale free approach to explanation as opposed to a reductive
approach sort of what would that what would we expect that to look like in principle
um but yes applying things like the freehand we we can argue that the free energy principle is completely Universal
but what does that mean it doesn't mean much of anything until you actually apply it in some system and and say how
do things really work right which is for example what Adam's trying to do to get to your other point about
um say causal efficacy being at a particular scale or being primarily at a particular scale or or the information
that's useful being at a particular scale foreign I think this is always relative to
um the same at the I'm an observer I have
particular dolls they may be explanatory goals they may be instrumental goals I'm looking at this system
and I'm evaluating models that I can construct of that
system at different scales so this is
taking this very simple picture and extending it very far in the
direction of of describing real science but very far in the direction that's
actually very difficult if you want to carry through with it
because it requires saying how do I make measurements of this
physical system at all these different scales and what do how do I make measurements
of what I see as the surrounding of that system at these different scales what do
I Define as noise uh so I'm I'm trying to make Observer
relative here all of the things that we typically for very good reasons treated treat as
objective and that's extremely difficult and I don't know whether it will
ever be able to actually pull much of that off from the theory point of view it may
just turn out to be hopelessly attractable um so we may always be forced back into
this very convenient instrumental way of
thinking of things as objective and even representing them as objective and are theorizing
even if we know that that is not really right or not really Justified
by um consistency within some deep framework I
mean this may just be girdle's Revenge or heraclitus is Revenge
good question great uh Richard please
uh thank you thank you so much Chris uh I really wish I was there for evening
conversations and lunchtime conversations I'm really miss being there with you guys uh so like I'm totally on board
um my inclination is towards a scale-free cognitive model of everything
uh you know cognition all the way down sort of thing so I'm totally on board with a scale free
framing of things um I wonder uh so a couple of points on
like you can just pick up on whatever uh you feel like so of course we could
have a multi-scale theory that wasn't uh invariant over scales and actually the
programming one um illustrates that point too so Pro
high level programming language way of describing what's going on inside my computer is a legitimate way of one
particular scale of describing what's going on and the level of electronic Gates is another way but they're not the
same Theory I don't think anyway of course it's neater if it is
the same at all scales uh I think it's fair that the to say
that the majority of signs that cosmology biology and Neuroscience is not scale free though it does suppose a
lowest causal scale that's um privileged in how things work
um but uh more importantly I mean obviously I'm
open to desperate to do science in a different way and I don't want science to be tied to being done in a
reductionist way uh so I have questions about no more specifically about free energy principle
and uh scale free application thereof um and this is just sort of uh it's
almost a stream of Consciousness thing so questions like is a scale free free
energy principles still ultimately tied to an idea of what persists exists is it
still ultimately tied to a fear of me not existing and a contraction of care
is it still based on natural selection principles I think not because you talk
about social groups and ecosystems doing the same kind of scale-free stuff which natural selection doesn't apply so it's
not driven by that does it avoid an eliminativism of the
real phenomena of questions we have um does we're all just trying to
minimize free energy at all scales does that statement help us find reason or affect or purpose or love or meaning
or avoid a crisis of meaning or expand a scope of care so I'm I'm totally fine with its uh
science doesn't have to be reductionist um I wonder whether the real offering
that the free energy principle or your way of thinking about things has to offer might be more to do with not just
that it's scale free but more to do with things like The Observer dependence and observer relative rather than being not
reductionist yeah yeah I I think a great benefit of
of the free energy principle way of thinking and this is a benefit that I
think wasn't recognized for a long time is that it's
intrinsically a theory of multi-agent communication and it may be very asymmetrical
uh it may be computationally very asymmetrical multi-aging communication
maybe semantically very asymmetrical multi-agent communication
uh it is at the quantitative level informationally symmetric multi-agent
communication um but it does
cast questions in science into this communicative framework
and that's that's what in fact most closely relates
it to Quantum information Theory which does the same thing so I I think that is a big change in the
way we think about things and you know I as some of us were saying
last night owl there's a big distinction between doing science as a meaningful
activity and and reading about it in the newspaper and I think a lot of the meaningfulness of science is lost
uh on people who read about it in the newspaper and that's
a question that we can think about trying to um improve the situation on
and I'm not sure that science itself can certainly help in that process
but um a theoretical formalism is not the
answer to that particular problem just briefly if I could I think there is
a way in which Richard's use of reductionism actually still applies I think in this context
and this is a different use of that term that comes it's very widespread in religious studies
but you'll also find it across other disciplines and cultural history and so on and so one way just a very quick
example for this is let's say I'm trying to account for what we mean by religion like what's the essential feature of
religion and a typical modernist account whatever that would be that it is about an individual a particular kind of
experience that individuals have that involves in some fashion knowing or
experiencing or embodying the Divine the sacred god what have you
so that scale of analysis is actually at the individual but then one can come along with a durkheimian account of
religion as a social phenomenon and the scale of analysis is not the individual it's actually it's actually a social
group and that would be called reductionists which is like admittedly kind of odd
because the scale is actually larger but that's called a reductionist explanation because what it's done is it's taken a
phenomenon like or an entity it's kind of ontologically deflationary
second entity like the sacred or God or the Divine and said actually we don't
need that so it's a limited to this we don't need God or that or the spirit or whatever this thing that we thought gave
us meaning for example we don't need that we can we have a better explanation which is the durkheimian social
explanation of religion so that's called reductionist because it is doing making this a limit to this move move and the
point the kind of General point then becomes science is reductionists in the sense that it's eliminating the
existence of these entities that we've been using to produce meaning for ourselves
and so it's not about necessarily the a scale here it's actually this kind of ontological move in the sense is that
our traditional means the entities that we've used to produce meaning in our lives have all been eliminated
so it's a peculiar use of reductionism but I think it's important for us to know that in this sense but Richard is
saying from the standpoint of religious studies still very much holds which is that in that limited to this
sense uh the reductionism of science has led to a crisis of meaning
okay that's that's really cool uh because I I
um yeah I I I I always use the term reductionism in this sort of philosophy
of science since and I've always wondered what people were talking about when they
talked about reductionism um in a way that obviously had no overlap
with the the old You Know Carl Hempel at all
uh sense of reductionism because they defined it very precisely right in terms of bridge laws and all that stuff
none of which I think makes any sense but that's how they defined it so okay so
I can understand that that the word reductionism could be used to mean what
illuminativism means and yes this doesn't talk about that at
all right and
and I would think of the case that you described as
um sort of a case of theory replacement
right all all Theory Replacements maybe that's too strong at least many Theory
or placements are in some sense eliminative so there's a deep sense in which quantum
theory for example uh gets rid of the idea of particles
so they're gone right it eliminates that idea it's still very useful idea we still use it all the time but we only
use it with a certain amount of trepidation because we know that it doesn't really apply
so it seems to me that what you're describing is a case of a theory replacement and
that has kind of the generic features of theory replacement in terms of being illuminative
and their are always people who are deeply
attached to to Concepts from some Theory or other and if they're replaced yeah that could
be difficult but um
I guess I would see that as what's happening in this case
thanks again for the opportunity to do this I appreciate it foreign
