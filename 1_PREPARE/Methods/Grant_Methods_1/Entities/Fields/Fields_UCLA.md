Chris Fields: Pushing the boundaries by dissolving them: Toward a scale-free
formalization of physical systems as observers


what I want to talk about today is how much can we learn in a very generic
sense about biology from looking at very simple physical systems
and let's see if I can figure out how to use the equipment here yeah so
okay so I want to start with the free energy principle that Carl friston introduced in the very first talk and I
formulated it here in a way that looks as much like a tautology is possible
so that you can see just how simple this principle is it basically says anything
that persists has got to behave in a way that contributes to persistence and if it
doesn't it stops persisting and that's that so I want to study the effects of this
in the simplest possible physical model and whereas Carl presented the fep in
terms of classical dynamical systems theory I'm going to use the language of
quantum information Theory because it's much much simpler and I'm going to think about the
simplest possible situation which is some system which I'll call S that interacts with some environment
which I'll call E um through a boundary which I'll call B
and this boundary is a boundary in the total joint State space so in quantum
theory that will be a kilbert space but you can think of it as just the collection of all of the degrees of
freedom that are of Interest and I'm going to make two simple simplifying assumptions
assumption number one is that e is everything that's not s
so if I think about my interaction with my environment my environment is just
not me so that includes everything that isn't me
and this simplifying assumption buys us something important it means that the
joint system is isolated because I built anything that we could consider to be an
extra component into e so we just have a bipartite decomposition
the other simplifying assumption I'm going to make is that everything inside is finite
uh what does that mean it means that the energy flows across this boundary has to
be finite so no infinite energy flows so no singularities and stuff like that
so in our last two questions what does this tell us about the structure of s and what does it tell us about the
structure of the interaction and I'm going to ask these questions just by looking at symbol simple
symmetries and then how they're broken so here's symmetry number one
the fep is a universal statement as as friston children as 2019 paper and since
we've shown using the in the quantum theoretic formulation
um and what that means what universality means here is just that I can exchange
these labels and I can label the left side system e
in the right side system s all that means is that because this is a an
isolated system oh the thing I previously called s is the
environment of E and so that means the free energy principle applies to both of
them both of these systems are acting to maintain the Integrity of this boundary
that separates them because it's maintaining the Integrity of the boundary that makes them
persistent systems if I take the boundary away both systems disappear all
I have is the joint system left so persistence requires the Integrity of this boundary and that's what the
systems act to assure so symmetry number two
is conservation of information and I can appeal from a Quantum theoretic point of
view to unitarity since this is an isolated system unitarity is just the principle that
information is conserved but we can also think of this in terms of Newton's third law right anything
that s does to e it can expect an equal and opposite response I.E for E to do
something to s and since these are energetically
balanced their informationally balanced the other perspective on this which is
very useful is because I've required that everything inside is finite I can
use the holographic principle which was originally developed for talking about black holes but what it says is that the
information coding capacity of any boundary is finite and quantitatively it puts a number to
the minimum size for encoding one bit but we don't need to worry about that
here in the case of a black hole it's it's uh
four plank areas which are very small and that defines a black hole actually
anything that has that encoding capacity is a black hole and anything that has a
smaller encoding density is not but what this does by requiring a finite
information capacity is it induces a pixelation on this boundary so that creates a discrete
topology mathematically and it gives it a finite dimension
and we know exactly what that Dimension is it's the dimension of the interaction operator which I've called HSE that's
just a hamiltonian operator and it also tells us exactly what information the boundary encodes
the eigenvalues of HSE are in dimensional numbers
or have an in-dimensional binary representation and so we can think of the boundary as
encoding the eigenvalues of the operator that crosses it and eigenvalues of the
hamiltonian or energy values so any of these interaction boundaries actually
encode a representation of the energy that's being exchanged across the boundary
now this tells us something very important which that is that s
can obtain exactly in bits about e and vice versa
so the amount of information that the system can get about its environment is
exactly in bits and vice versa so the environment can learn exactly in bits
about the system so that's a very powerful symmetry
symmetry number three is a little bit more subtle but not a whole lot
and it depends on this fact that if S and E are separable
which in quantum theory means if they're not entangled but classically the analog is if their states are conditionally
independent which if you recall from Carl's talk is a requirement of the fep
then the dimensions which you can read just as the number of degrees of freedom
but formally is the hilber space dimension of the system and the
dimension of its environment must be a lot bigger than the dimension of the boundary
otherwise they'll cease to be conditionally independent now if that's true
we can write this operator this hamiltonian operator that represents the
interaction and a particular really simple form which is a bunch of thermodynamic stuff
KT and a constant of times a sum of simple operators Each of which you can
think of as acting on one bit and I can
is there a back button on this I hope so there's a picture of what these M
operators look like each one acts on one Quantum bit that's in the boundary and
it reads one classical bit off of that and It prepares that some classical bit
that the system wants to prepare so it's a very simple representation of
the operator and since this is a sum it means that I can rearrange these M
operators any way I want to I can I can effectively relabel the the indices any
way I want to and what that does is just swap what ones and zeros are written in what
positions on the boundary and since I've since the boundary
encodes an eigenvalue of energy when I when I move ones and zeros around I change the eigenvalue so I change the
value of the energy that's coming across the boundary from the perspective of the system
all that means is that I'm moving the zero point of energy up and down and I can move that point up and down
arbitrarily without changing anything about the physics so
this exchange symmetry doesn't do anything to the interaction it just
changes the numerical value that's associated with it on one side of the boundary
and this this is actually required for separability now if I lose this ability
to freely choose what basis I'm operating in so how I've how I've
labeled the boundary with bits then it turns out that induces
entanglement or that's just a way of defining entanglement so I have to have this free choice of of
moving things around okay so those are three simple symmetries of any generic
physical interaction between finite systems given this condition of
separability in other words conditional independence of their states so now we can start talking about
biology and what we can learn from this and
the bottom line is that any system that's actually interesting breaks this
third symmetry and what I'll spend the rest of the talk doing is looking at ways this third
symmetry is broken and how they give us
bits of information that's interesting from a biological point of view so if you don't break this third
symmetry you just have a Quantum noise interaction right there's there's nothing there's nothing outside the
system to contribute any classical perturbation so there's no classical noise at all in this picture
so this thermodynamic interaction is just Quantum noise
um but any system that acts irreversibly on its environment so it does something
to its environment that affects what its environment is going to do to it that is what I mean by irreversible here
um has to burn some free energy to do so and the reason is just Land hours
principle that if I write a bit irreversibly that costs energy I can
read bits all I want as as a previous talk pointed out actually but writing
bets costs energy and that energy can only come from one place it can only come from the environment
because I'm working in a closed joint system so
s if s is going to get extra free energy it has to get it for me so this breaks the symmetry of the
interaction if I'm doing anything irreversible because I have to say Okay
I'm going to dedicate that bit of the boundary uh to a free energy Supply
and we've all got perfect examples of that the power cord in your computer is a thermodynamic sector of its boundary
and you don't do any information processing with that free energy that
comes in it Powers the information processing that you do by typing on the keyboard and playing with the mouse and
all of that of your food supply is an example of a thermodynamic sector of your boundary
so this is the first symmetry breaking that that actually characterizes life it's got to get free energy from some
place so that it can act on its environment in a way that actually influences its environment and if you
recall from from Carl's presentation that action on the environment is half of the active inference equation
learning is the other half so now let's think about memory
if I want to act on my environment and I want to store some observed
consequence of my action and I've got to write a bit someplace
and since I'm working a Quantum theoretic setting the only place I can put classical information is on the
boundary now maybe I'm taking that boundary of pulling some of it inside me
uh and I'll show you a picture of that a little bit later on but wherever that
bit of boundary is I've got to write this classical information on the boundary so I have to break the Symmetry
Again by allocating some sector of the boundary to the memory that I write
and that does an interesting thing to the inside of the system that says that the inside of the system
has got to implement a clock that a simple clock that counts bits because it has to be able to distinguish
uh information from then from information from now
and that requires a Time variable so it has to implement this little internal
clock and this clock turns out to be what in the theory is called a Quantum reference
frame it's a physical object that encodes some standard which is internal to the system and specific to
this system for time so what uh
what happens as soon as we have a sector like this for memory
well it means that we now have a metabolic trade-off
we've gotten free energy from the environment and now we have to decide how to use it we can allocate it to
perceptions of getting information and then acting on the on the environment on
the basis of that information or we can allocate it to memory and if I have a fixed amount of free
energy I can sort of turn a knob between perception and memory and try to find a
place that's good that if I want to keep getting information from the environment and
processing it I better not spend too much money on memory
so what do systems do the solution we see over and over again is they coarse grain their memory
by course creating the memory I write fewer bits to represent a past event so
I represent it lower resolution and you see examples of this trade-off
everywhere in your computer you don't course grain your memory you want to keep an exact
record but up here you do coarse grain your memory
and in fact all organisms that I know of course green their memories
so they they bias their their free energy budget toward getting information
okay so now let's think about A system that doesn't just look at its
environment and remember things it looks at him it's at its environment and it
sees particular objects that are distinct so I look out at you and I see a bunch of people I see some tables and
chairs I see lights doors walls all this stuff so I'm identifying a lot of
objects right now and if I want to identify an object
then I have to do two things I have to have a
some kind of detector that says this is an object
and this is the same object next time I look and it's the same object next time
I look but I have to have another detector that says okay there's some states that have
changed and you can see this really clearly with the scientific instrument where if I
tell you to go in the lab and read the voltmeter the first thing you got to do is find the volt meter before you can
read it and then reading it is a different process that assumes that you've found it
so every time I see an object I have to allocate two sectors of my boundary one
for what I keep constant to identify the object and the other one to look at its
variable the variable that's of Interest or the variable that I can measure without seeing it as a different object
and in physics the the variable is always called a pointer State because of old meters that had pointers
so I call these the reference sector in the pointer sector so if I see an object I've automatically
made two more sector divisions in both my information space and my memory space
because in my memory space I've got to write down that I saw this state of that
object so I have to write two distinct records and I don't want them to get Mis messed
up mixed up so okay and all of this requires
free energy because I've got to keep these sector boundaries fixed
so now I can think about identifying more
than one object and um any time I deploy operators that can't
be deployed at exactly the same time I've got to break this symmetry again
and write a different set of sectors in my memory and I use the word non-codeployable here
because I may not be able to to deploy these operators because they really
don't commute and some fundamental physics way up Spin and sideways spin
but I may not be able to deploy them simultaneously just because I don't have the free energy to do it
and that's just as bad right if I don't have the free energy I can deploy this
one and then I have to wait a little bit and deploy that one I can't do them at the same time
and it turns out that if you can deploy two operators simultaneously you can just do that and or the or and have one
operator but if they're not co-deployable then you have to represent them separately
and Define their own sectors so there are many many many examples in in human perception and
other perception and physical measurement and on and on and on of operators that you can't deploy
simultaneously so what does this do it makes this trade-off much much more
complicated uh because it it's cut the boundary up into many sectors
and given a free energy constraint it means that you have to make decisions
about what sector you're looking at and you typically don't want to completely ignore sectors of your
boundary so you just don't Focus attention on them so what this tells us is that any system
essentially that can look at its environment in more than a couple of ways
and has memory has to have an attention system even if even if it's a very
simple attention system and attention here just means control control of what I'm deploying to look at the environment
and control of how I move free energy resources around between my
computational resources okay so what does this tell us about s's
internal structure and I'll spend the rest of the talk on
this question of what can we learn about any system any generic physical system
that has these symmetry breaking capabilities and in particular what can
we learn about any organism since organisms break all of these symmetries
well uh what we can first rely on is a
theorem this is a Quantum theoretic theorem
and I should back up and say that oh a feature of of this whole discussion is
that when we look at the state space there's no requirement that it has any geometric degrees of freedom
so I'm doing this in a in a representation that doesn't assume anything about
space-time so in the classical fep you typically assume that the parts of a system are
located in different space compartments and that's part of what
keeps them conditionally independently independent but in quantum theory you don't need to do that you don't have to
assume anything about space-time at all and as we'll see we're going to get space time out of this instead of having
to put it in from the beginning so we have this theorem that says if I
have two computational resources I'll call them q1 and Q2 and they can't be deployed simultaneously
then we have to keep them separate inside the system and by separate I mean
not entangled because if they're entangled I won't be able to distinguish them
but I made the assumption that I can deploy them individually so you've got to be separate they can't be entangled
and that means that they're they're compartmentalized in a way that forces
them to only communicate classically uh so they can only communicate by
exchanging bit strings if they're not entangled well what does that mean it means I have
to have boundaries inside my system that divide these compartments that can only
communicate classically so physics alone with nothing else
if you assume you have the cognitive or the computational capability to break
the symmetry of your boundary the physics gives you compartmentalization with boundaries that can only be crossed
with classical information and here's a very simple stripped down
system that has a memory compartment and uh
two compartments that let us let it look at it at its environment and think of these as both being split into a
reference detector and a pointer detector so this is a little thing that can identify two
different objects and remember something and even at this level of Simplicity uh
because of this theorem about classical information and compartmentalization you
have to have a control compartment which is separate from these perception and memory compartments and that manages
this attention system which is allocating free energy and saying don't do this do that now
and um some colleagues and I have
done a general theory of how to represent these control structures and it turns out you can do it with tensor
Networks and you can describe control with tensor
networks only if you have this kind of compartmentalization that keeps
things that can't be co-deployed in unentangled compartments that can
only communicate classically so the theory holds together quite nicely and you get this compartmentalization for
free so let's look at a single compartment and what its relation with its
environment is and I've picked one of the compartments that looks at the external environment e
but since it has this internal boundary that enforces classical communication it
also sees other internal compartments that are like it I.E other compartments
that do perception and action and then it also sees this this compartment behind it that does control
and so if you think of this in a free energy principle way uh where you're
interested in how is the free the variational free energy so how is as
surprise or unpredictability or risk or however you want to describe
the vfp how is that distributed across the boundary
and in the case of this little compartment the bit that faces the exterior
environment is going to encode the highest vfe because it's the least predictable system
the compartments on both sides are compartments that are a whole lot like me right they do the same thing I
do so it's easier for me to predict what they're going to do and how they're
going to behave and what kind of information they're going to send across the boundary because they're a lot like
me they're and I don't need to know they're a lot like me I just need to recognize that I'm not getting a lot of
surprise all from from those compartments on the side now the control system behind me may
work in a completely different way than I do although from a very generic point
of view you can represent using the same kind of mathematics so it's probably got
a little bit higher vfe than than the ones on the side but a lot less than the
one in front I.E the environment so if these sectors behave differently
and I have a way of detecting what vfe is on what part of the boundary
then from my point of view as a little compartment I can distinguish between the parts of
my environment that I'm not too worried about my cousins if you will and the the part behind me that
occasionally tells me what to do and the part in front of me that's very uncertain that my job is to measure and
act on so here's a more familiar view of of what one of these systems looks like
there's an outside environment there's an outer ring of things that face that outside environment and there's an
inside that does all the control functions and allocates free energy and
one of these outside compartments of course is the free energy Supply the power supply that doesn't have a measurement function
it's it's just a source and this picture applies at whatever scale
you like I haven't made any scale assumptions so these compartments can represent Pathways inside a cell they
can represent cells inside an organism they can represent tissues they can represent organisms in a community
whatever you want the the fep is a scale-free model of any
physical system that's interacting with with any environment
so to get to this sort of of structure uh I would claim that all you really
need is an operation that does copy and diversify
so if you if you have a little system that's in an environment
and it can make a copy of itself that's a little bit different
then it can change its environment by adding this copy to it and what does
that do it gives it a piece of its environment that suddenly has a lot more
predictability than the rest of the environment so I know as a piece of the environment that's kind of friendly
so if it makes a bunch of these copies and kind of surrounds itself with copies
then its environment suddenly looks really nice right it's it's environments
now highly predictable the hard problem of predicting what the external
environment is going to do has been shoved out in one layer to these copies
now let's look at exactly this same thing but look at it from the point of view of a boundary that would be outside
of the copies now initially that boundary doesn't do anything right because there are no
copies but the the free energy at that boundary which now surrounds mostly the
environment is the the free energy that is created
by part of the environment writing on another part of the environment now some of the copies get into it
the outer part of the environment still sees mostly stuff that's like it
but now there are these these odd things in it that are doing something interesting and as I fill that annulus up with the
odd things that are interesting then the environment environment on the outside sees a very different system it
suddenly sees the system that looks multicellular and that has some kind of collective
Behavior but no part of the system inside that boundary
can detect the collective Behavior or represent the collective Behavior
uh beyond the function of saying I need to give more free energy over here
I'm going to give more free energy over here so other than this Control Function so the Control Function is the the very
basic representation of the self but it's it's not a representation of the whole self it's just a representation of
the part itself that provides free energy and needs free energy
Okay so let's take this a little bit further we've broken our exchange symmetry on
the boundary we've made distinctions between data sectors something that allows us to do is put
some information in one sector and put the same information in another sector so we can create an error correcting
code and error correcting codes are the basis for languages
and I'll give you an example of an error correcting code if I just write 10 at
different positions in space then I can obscure a bunch of it and still make out but it's 10. and I can do the same thing
in time so a resource for error correcting codes is spacetime
but if I have an error correcting code if I can write some data here and write
some data here and tell them apart then I've got the beginnings of a
representation of a spatial difference between part of my boundary and some other part of my boundary
so if I have an error correcting code I can start to build space time
from my own perspective so I can start to build what's important about space-time which
is an ability to measure space and time and this is a very popular idea in
quantum gravity there are dozens of papers per month talking about building space time from error correcting codes
so it's a place where biology and physics really come together in that a thing we don't really investigate
outside of mammals in the hippocampus and all that is how systems organize
space what their detector for space is and how much space they can see so they
can see can they see a radial coordinate on on a
two-dimensional or on an angular coordinate a two-dimensional boundary can they see a radial coordinate going
away from them uh we should be asking those questions about E coli or Yeast or paramecium
which I expect can represent space pretty well okay so to sum up
distinguishable boundary sectors allow redundant encoding and has error correction
uh if I have that plus some internal logic I can have a representation of space
and if I have morphological complexity so if I can put detectors on lots of
little parts of my boundary and tell them apart from the inside which my
control system has to do to allocate free energy uh
then I can have a very complicated representation of space so if you think about a neuron that has a branching tree
it's sampling lots of parts of space so as it brings those signals together
it loses that spatial information but it keeps part of it implicitly in things
like time differences between signals and phase differences between phase differences between signals
okay so what does this tell us about living systems it tells us that all living systems at
all scales co-evolve with their environments which are in fact agents that's the symmetry of the fep
it tells us that even minimal cognition seeing more than one object that's distinguishable requires internal
compartmentalization it tells us that we'll expect metabolic trade-offs at every scale
uh which are going to drive systems to different degrees of coarse graining at
different scales it tells us that competing resources
always require an attention system and it tells us I think most importantly the detecting objects
and memory and a spatial representation are essentially three three sides of the
same coin and you can make it four sides by adding error correcting codes
so those are all in some sense the same concept if you think about them from a
physical point of view instead of a psychological point of view
um now this will be the only bit of data that I show you but a consequence is that you just
expect this massively increasing control system complexity as a number of different
things you can measure go up and this is a plot we published a couple of years ago
between the log of the area of a cell and uh
the number of bits that that sells energy budget allows it to process at
one kilohertz um cells have incredibly small energy
budgets for the massive amount of information processing they do which leads us to suggest that they're using
coherence for a lot of their information processing not classical manipulation
and the slope of this line is is above two so it's way bigger than Elementary and that suggests that
they're putting a lot of information on internal boundaries not their external boundary
and up here the eukaryotes have very very large Pathways is you're all
familiar with the interconnect and the prokaryotes have pretty simple Pathways and not
nearly as many of them so they're not burning nearly as much energy so thanks to my collaborators Carl
who spoke yesterday Mike will speak later today and Jim glasberg and
Antonino Marciano thank you [Applause]
thank you very much we have a couple of minutes before the break uh one or two questions
okay I'll give it a go thank you so you mentioned at the beginning the Symmetry between the system and the environment
that if assets the system then on the other side of the boundary that's equally a system for the environment that was the other way around
does the the compartmental compartmentalization of the boundary into thermal informational and memory
is that symmetric too is the is one systems boundary have the same
compartments when you flip it around and or and is the free energy source for one
presumably not the free energy source for the other it's a compact component would be the info part of that to that
side do you understand what I'm asking yes and it's a beautiful question
and it all gets back to that remark about free choice and basis being
required to avoid entanglement so each side gets to sector their
boundary any way they want to they're completely free to sector their boundary in any way
so I may have lots of informative sectors my environment may just have a thermodynamic sector
so everything I do to my environment may look like noise to the environment even
though it looks like signal to me uh the the system in the environment
can have equally complex sets of
sensors and actors and all of that but they may be completely misaligned
so they don't communicate in the same language at all but the interesting case
is what happens as the
the perception action loops on the two sides of the boundary start to become aligned
well the free energy principle is driving all systems to minimize their free energy on both sides
so they can minimize their free energy by aligning all of their detectors
so that what I write is what the environment expects and what the
environment writes is what I expect and of course we do that we call a language
uh now think of the limit think of a system interacting with an
environment and it approaches this synchrony in
reading and writing and so perfect predictability over its entire boundary
well as it starts to get perfect predictability in its boundary it has to
do less and less work because what the environment tells it is
always what it would have told the environment anyway so it needs less and less free energy to
process information because it's never surprised so it can shrink its its fuel sector if
you will in the limp down toward the limit of zero and so you can in the limit approach a
situation where both system and environment are writing on their Mutual
boundary and exactly the same way so each one is exactly satisfying the
other's expectations now that's of course the limit that the fep says we're all aiming for
right the fep says we're all trying to minimize our vfa right minimize the
difference between our predictions and what we actually see but what is that limit
right in quantum theory where we don't make this assumption about space talk
The Limited exact synchrony is entanglement so we cease to be separate systems
that's so the fep is basically a classical limit of the principle of unitarity
which just says that that all systems will approach entitlement we have a very good question
uh yeah there's a question in the chat um
it is does this mean the environment has
some quote interest in maintaining the boundary and if so why yes if the
environment doesn't maintain the boundary it ceases to exist as a system
the the environment in the system are co-defined in other words thank you very much okay thank you to
