Automated and Autonomous Legal Entities

I think some of that will flow on into the next discussion but I'm really really happy courtesy of the MIT
computational door report and a lot of the work that they've been doing the friends been a part of and the desert
has been one of the chief masterminds and co-conspirators of that we're all
very happy to have has it here right now so does it so the band's mostly all here
so let's start playing so this session is about basically creating so we know
legal entities and we just had a nice discussion about the Dow like as in the Dow hack but that's really about just
decentralized autonomous organizations
so there's some overlap between what people want to do with these organizations on the blockchain and what
we would consider a legal entity you know something in this legal container that is that can sue and be sued that
can form and enforce an enforceable contract for example that has legal
personality you know corporations LLC's are great traditional examples of these
are not the only type and there's been a real desire to start to align for at
least some subset of these Dow sand and other software based entities a legal
entity status and so this this panel is to start to first will frame some of
what we think the issues are from the MIT computational law report perspective
based on a very comprehensive literature review and some prototyping that we've been doing and monitoring all of these
projects and drew them zosky we'll do that first he's our research editor at
the report and then we're going to go down the line to basically hear what
people are working on and what we think are some of the more some of the most exciting projects that are actually
deploying this code and then we want to have some time to to allow it the
panelists to speak with each other and to feel your questions and comments as well with a with a good discussion period toward
the end so with that um let's see if we can figure out how Andrew dumb zovsky
can screen share the first Andrew please of them introduce yourself for a moment
and then let's get right into the overview that we put together sure no problem thank you hello everyone
for those of you who don't know me my name is as I said I am the research editor of the MIT computational law
report if I can get my screen to properly share I will begin my presentation
is that working it works looks great
okay excellent so I'm happy to begin our discussion on AAL es with an overview of
an automated legal entity law this presentation will be primarily concerned
with the following questions how would an automated legal entity be regarded by
the law what rights would the automated legal entity have would have have
personhood specifically legal personhood how would the law apportion the
liability of an automated legal entity especially with regard to its damages
the cost resulting from damages and what does the legal literature say about
automated legal entity law as Dazza said previously this presentation is sort of
the product of a fairly extensive review of the current legal literature and hopefully we can get a couple of answers
from a number of questions so because an
algorithmic legal entity contains at its core and algorithm and intelligent
algorithm we must first ask how the law would treat the automated legal entities underlying numerous legal scholars have
discussed this largely to say that the a I wouldn't necessarily fit into various
legal frameworks whether the tort law or criminal law or corporate law Victor
genre and the conclusion is fairly similar AI is you and so this leaves two
fundamental questions the question of artificial intelligence liability and
the question of artificial intelligence legal status
so let's proceed to the first fundamental question the question of getting a liability we have the classic
example of a I tort liability a fully autonomous car injures of pedestrian
what entity is responsible is it the manufacturer is it the driver isn't the
artificial intelligence itself or something else is it some other entity
some consortium of entities we can also insider' criminal liability many
criminal statutes are premises upon a criminal act that was conducted with
requisite criminal intent over criminal mindset can an artificial intelligence
act with the requisite intent for the purposes of those criminal statutes and
even if you could assign criminal liability to an artificial intelligence how couldn't hey I even be punished
would punishment deter future AI crimes how do you incentivize the behavior of
an artificial intelligence and there are procedural issues as well artificial
intelligence is especially autonomous legal entities are likely to be able to proliferate rapidly across various
jurisdictions how could the court compel the attendance of an artificial
intelligence at trial how could a court assert process on an AI where has it
just - just to take an example from Civil Procedure where has an AI made a minimum contacts or personal
jurisdiction so what frameworks does the existing law
provide to help answer some of these questions to regulate artificial intelligences in my review of the
literature I'd say that the most popular single solution was strict liability essentially we can design a scheme that
will some grouping of manufacturers users designers programmers strictly
liable there's some apportionment mechanism and various insurance schemes can be used to support this
from a financial perspective there's also agency law which may afford some
benefits to utilizing it simply you know we can establish an agency relationship
between the artificial intelligence and a principle of some kind and acute liability onto the principle there's
also the framework of products liability especially with regard to complex products liability and I would be quite
the complex product as a liability would be based upon the foreseeability of harm
probably from the perspective of the manufacturer and then I just thought this was kind of interesting as a means
of addressing the procedural issues establish a new type of civil
jurisdiction in Robottom which is sort of play on the in rem proceeding so to
move on to the second fundamental question we have additional sort of
genres of law that AI autonomous legal entity law implicates intellectual
property will come up you know whether it be the framework of copyrights or
patents Canon AIB awarded those protections for its own works to take the example of patent law inventions
would be awarded patent protection if they are new useful and non-obvious if
in artificial intelligence meets these criteria clear should it be awarded the
requisite protection directly employing this corporate law Canon artificial
intelligence sir as a member of an LLC corporate director or general partner a partnership and what would be the
consequences of doing so what would be the consequences of granting AI the
personhood that in a request at some point in the future there will be
obviously legal consequences but also ethical economic and social consequences
so as with the first fundamental question we can take some examples from
the current legal statuses in Prior examples we can fit artificial
intelligence onto or into an existing legal status there's obviously a wide
body of law as it relates to the legal status of animals wild animals are slightly different children contractors
even ships rivers temples and churches have been afforded some extent the legal
protection in the past obviously corporate legal entities the entire body of corporate law can can serve as some
amount of instruction for this we could potentially put AI into a corporate
legal anitya corporation LLC partnership one one particular legal status that I
thought might be interesting for this discussion it's a Canadian line back from Roman times the status of helium
which was a wheeled device in which a slave had very limited legal rights to
engage in contracts and owned property so you might imagine an analog where an
artificial intelligence would have a bank account and would have a certain right to conduct business on behalf of
someone else perhaps other options obviously are to grant artificial
intelligence personally or perhaps in the in reviving analog of Vettes we
could fashion a new legal status specifically tailored for it and also a
number of legal scholars recommended that we refuse so at the MIT com
or we have tried to advance the discussion of some of these questions by
devising a working proposal I work on proposal to address hopefully some of
the questions as it relates to artificial intelligence of regulation we
would the working proposal basically functions as follows first treat the
algorithmic entities under agency law initially the initiator which might be
the manufacturer if you'd like would be the principal in this agency
relationship and the principal would be responsible for the actions of the
artificial intelligence that are within its granted authority so as with common
agency relationships the principal provides a agency grant to the agent and
the agent is permitted to act within that scope the scope of authority can be defined in a registry system that we
thought was kind of similar to the way robots.txt files were used for search engines so it could be accessible in a
way that other third parties could acknowledge what the scope of authority was the AI as it pertains to his graham
thority would have certain limited rights to conduct business within its scope now failing or failing the agency
scope if the AI agent did in fact act outside of this register scope of agency
then a strict liability scheme would be intuitive this would satisfy what will
likely be a social demand for responsibility and avoiding the potential for an accountability gap as a
release artificial intelligence liability while limiting the application of strict line and we think this might
be important because as was acknowledged in a couple of instances in the legal literature
strict liability can at times be an impediment to technological innovation so if there is a mechanism where we can
take at least the agency scope and that from the strict liability scheme that might be helpful to enable further
technological innovation the group of entities who would be held strictly liable should have some chip at some
extent of meaningful human control over the development of the AI that would
just makes sense for the grouping of the strict liability scheme so we've thought
of a couple of scenarios that we thought might be interesting to attempt to apply either the working proposal or maybe
another proposal that you might want to discuss as a relates to artificial intelligence liability how about the
working proposal adjudicate the classic example the tort liability of an autonomous vehicle what would happen a
second example what would happen if an algorithmic trading but did not deliver his end of the bargain but paid anyway
obviously these are highly fact-specific scenarios and every time you pose a question twenty more come up but we
thought we would just get the ball rolling by coming up with some of the most relevant effect factual questions
that might help us address these particular scenarios I mean obviously dealing with Porter law the first
question may jury will be what's the proximate cause getting into a little
bit of a products liability flavor was there a manufacturing defect that led to the car crash or led to needed training
about not conducting a trade properly was there a contractual mistake could we
focus on contractual law as a way of you know framing the issue with regard to
the agency question has the artificial intelligence exceeded it's a party and
you know has the robot.txt file been violated as it relates to the work what
would a reasonable person have believed to be even agency scope or the authority
of the artificial intelligence in general or were there any third party interviewing causes that might have
impacted the liability so we thought those would be some doing factual
scenarios and good consideration is that my aid in the discussion or was very likely a
complicated question outstanding thank you very much Andrew
and that was the result of wanna know like 30 or 40 like obscenely huge Law
Review articles that we are kind of strip-mined to get the best of what we thought was the existing thinking and so just to
highlight a couple points before we launch into everyone's perspectives yeah do you have this robot.txt file or just
looking at you know when people are dealing with automated lis an autonomous
legal entity is there something like a registry or or some type of service
that's almost like a license plate where they could know who is standing behind it and what what is what how do we
expect it to behave that they can interact with it appropriately and then the idea of meaningful human control
came mostly from autonomous weapon systems and looking at closing the accountability gap from that I'll be say
it's very different set of facts but it it aspects of it made sense so the big
some of the big questions we hope to hear from everybody from your different from your perspectives is what's the role of the human in your concept of
open of an autonomous legal entity are they driving the thing basically is it
is it operating on their behalf are they like the agents like of a corporation something are there no humans involved
whatsoever as we know that that is the concept for some of these things so alright let's let's launch I'm just
going to go straight down the list as it appears in the in the program and first up we have our beloved Noah Thor Noah
hey alright this is gonna be a fire hose [Laughter]
we're ready now okay okay you see my
screen yes okay oops I'm not sure the document I'm just gonna
go into presentation mode so okay great so I'm going to give a little
bit of a personal background about or sort of experience from the field from a
lot of ideas that that have been sort of floating around space mostly on supporting distributed collaboration
through dows and decentralized organizations where there are humans in the loop so my introduction to this was
back in 2014 with the Telex post about taoist ax2 da's and more and he sort of
breaks it up between humans at the edges or in the center and where the automation is and current organizations
are these sort of boring old organizations and we've mostly been experimenting with two centralized organizations and dowse and his sort of
categorization system so here's what led up to the initial versions that we were
that we were doing I call this that was less than or equal to one dot oh so it
goes back to Ronald Coase about how firms are actually going to form them and under what conditions there's a
number of costs that are part of forming firms which is about finding collaborators making sense of current
state of things making decisions bargaining and force rules and values if those costs are lower in a decentralized
fashion than in a centralized fashion then people will favor decentralized organizations over centralized ones
right now the cost is actually fairly high and we haven't moved into those orgs so I think the future in a lot of
cases about dropping these expenses so I would experiment with these in a venture
studio called citizen code or running as a holic recei we were exploring all the pioneers of self-organization from like
cybernetics accuracy visas chaotic organizations through sort of modern and spiral pirate party political swarm
organization stuff and we were exploring those firms principles little asterisks
no one really pays attention to clearly defined boundaries or the nesting of multiple layers of oceans principles but
we should pay more attention to those and I was asking myself what is the right game to play and we were sort of
choosing between prisoner's dilemma which is they came to competition versus how do you shift these games into more
mutual payoffs for how I'm creating hunting's for a big game we're solving
big challenges so our first word was this thing called swarm bought this came out in 2015 it was proposals and
there were tokens and those tokens represented crypto equity what we're calling this time instead of security
tokens and so we built this thing it was it was pretty interesting to explore ran
inside of slack and it was it was kind of successful and then this like the
Dowa thing happened we'll come back to that but a high-level thing that we learned about this at this time was
we're sort of obsessed with this idea of merchant properties of things and one of
the big lessons that I've learned is that merchant properties can lead to the thing on the left emergent collaboration like you see was
forms of fishes and the thing of the rate which is these like emergent disasters though it's all about trying
to figure out like what are these underlying rules that we want to have in play that our systems are enforcing those protocols can lead to both of
those things so we learned a bunch of other things people like flexibility and autonomy everybody hates governance meetings and
velocity of decision-making is really critical we'll come back to that later so in relation to what I've been working
on now is comb a curry and there is actually a comb a curry mission that is
set up for this project I hope it will circle back to that later in the day but basically there are missions and under
missions there are there are projects and people can work on we can track contributions in some cases and and
there are there's a task system as well so this sort of a way of managing swarms around common missions and sort of would
have outside of that so the other thing that we couldn't help bumping into and
this actually took up the bulk of the time that I spent over the last few years is the security token problem
which is if you just create this swarm of people that get crypto equity or sweat equity and the project is we
thought of it you're you know likely forming an unincorporated association you don't have any limited liability and
you're probably you know we're gonna get to do all these regulatory issues so this actually forced me into this
security token cycle right after we launched that the dau happened it got
hacked but you know this we have this this big crash and II that that time and
then the SE see reported investigation of the Dow came out in 2017 and it really
highlighted all the issues around spinning up these these what
cryptographers thought were and computer programmers thought was a great way of organizing people around common missions
ended up you know violating a lot of regulations so the modern version of that working with a company called
Republic and they are launching a regulatory compliant security token that
is using reg CF for unaccredited investors kamay trees involved with that I can talk to anybody who wants to learn
more about that later also ended up building this shares post class network which was routing orders orders to each
different jurisdiction to settle these transactions wherever they needed to get settled and we built this and then it
was delayed due to crypto winter and regulatory risk fortunately after a year of me bleeding over it and ended up
building an open-source framework around security token transfer restrictions a very lightweight one I'll give some
links of this later so where are we kind of now at was three ATO I think there
are a bunch of challenges that we have for decentralized autonomous organizations specifically around these
proposal based days which is the the common way that people are organizing or thinking about the house in many cases I
say the problem with them is that you end up with low voter participation you can end up with you know the usual
problems in some democratic situations where the majority overtakes individual
choice and you can end up with in coherence across sequences of decision such as budgeting you end up with a lot
of slow low-quality decisions the wreckage ility which is kind of ironic because a lot of the software engineers building these things came from an agile
engineering background and we're just building these giant waterfall processes and then you also end up this problem
where overpowered geeks are the only ones going to retain the technical complexity and so you end up with this
like weird dawn geek voter suppression issue I've been experimenting with some other models one is this virtru Dao idea
which is a kind of new type of decentralized autonomous organization wheres worms are motivated to to move
towards a common mission people individually a word virtually to each other and you you get a portion of
funds to continue working towards the mission based on your virtue and your virtue decays over time and I'll say
that out of all of my predictions for 2030 what's oh yes I want to see if
there is a proposal proposal diyos do you went out I want to see proposal making Dallas they could make over a
thousand high quality decisions per day as opposed to a few per month and I also
want to see Dow is offering continuous value aligned employment human autonomy I think we should watch out for what's
going to happen with zero knowledge Dallas because it'll happen eventually and I expect that there'll be a rise of AI central planning that's my
presentation oh wow okay tour-de-force
yet might take away the virus your virtue decays over time that's so
poignant alright so next up we have you to do let me see if I can I hear Erin
there we go right professor right hey
thanks that was a great presentation no great to see so many familiar faces on
this call you know many ways this panel I think is really a testament to John is also a
panelist who put together a series of events at MIT I guess back in 2015-2016
yeah and now I almost said hair back then but now it's gone but you know a
lot of these issues that I think we're still grappling with the kind of rough architecture and framework for some of
these questions were really formed during these really insightful and important events that John and others
put together so you know I think it's wonderful that you're here John I also think it's wonderful that both MIT and
Stanford have continued to take the lead here really exploring this I would just
say you know thinking about Gav's at a high level in my mind and and Primavera
and I wrote a bit about this in in our book you know every big technological era has
really brought with it a change in organizational structures so we saw kind of the rise of industrialization lead to
the birth of joint-stock companies in Europe which were state granted monopolies and we saw how the railroad
boom in the 1800's led to the birth of preferred stock or two classes of stock which is really powering and continues
to power venture capital financing we saw have a kind of growth of global finance and oil shocks led to the birth
of LLC's taking first route Wyoming and obviously expanding across the u.s. and increasingly across the globe and I do
think that blockchain technology just because of its core substrates its ability to store in a tamper-resistant
way records its ability to transfer value and it's a ability to serve as a
central point of reference will mark another shift in just the way that we create organizations I think vitalik has
Noah mentioned before was prescient in recognizing this and understanding it
and in many ways building off of dam Larimer who was working with the OS his
work with with Dax and kind of decentralized autonomous corporations and I also agree with what Noah said in
the sense that we have yet to see arguably fully autonomous organizations
at best we have organizations where humans are at the edges and I think you
can including that and your broadest definition of dowse both the Bitcoin and Athena networks which have Dow or Dow
like characteristics so for me a lot of the legal questions and other issues
that folks grapple with are much less about artificial intelligence and and much much more about a understanding
what these organizations are useful for and be also understanding how we can
begin to deploy them in a reasonable and thoughtful way that's why I've been
excited to help try to put together at least an approach to doing that with an
initiative called the Lao I'm very excited about initiatives like D org you know we have several folks that are affiliated with and and and thinking
about and you know I also went through just some of my oh the nice thing about having a persistent record maintained by
Google as I went through and checked when folks started really talking about LLC's and aus and it really was
Josh Fairfield who's a professor at Washington and Lee University while
professor who said it one of these MIT meetings that we should really think
about how to set up a dau inside of a limited liability company and it's great for my vantage point to just see a
couple years later a number of substantive projects in that space I think where we are now particularly
legal wrapped dows is really an intermediate step and I think that we
need a place in order to understand what these organizations are useful for what
they may evolve into before we can kind of either evolve the law or relax the
law in order to enable broader larger organizations organizations that are
permissionless in nature organ organizations that are easier to set up set up and deploy and also organizations
that can scale not across just a single state or similar jurisdiction but across
the globe so I think I think we're getting there sorry one thing that you
know we I put together just as a way to kind of think about it and which may be
useful I'll share this general but I think you know kind of we saw a lot of kind of pure code base styles emerge
over the past couple years and you know it's arguable and debatable whether or not Bitcoin and aetherium are dows let's
just put that argument aside and just assume that they are but we've also seen other projects that that feel more Dow
like you know including maker as being probably the largest example and then we've seen a kind of a whole host of
grant-giving dows that were not really fully formed entities but we're trying to kind of navigate around some of the
legal issues by by just providing grants so Moloch Dow no medic or tell along
with marketing daily anger etc we're good examples I think that in many ways because of those legal concerns and this
is the big shame here because we the law is not really accommodating some experiments there's been a limit limited
and limited opportunities to begin to experiment with the growth of house I think by wrapping I was in some sort of legal structure
you at least begin to have an opportunity to explore this in different ways both to set up tax or you know
decentralized autonomous corporations fund structures obviously lots of media and fashion related organizations and
insurance pools which I think are critically important for the help of the the blockchain and the freedom
ecosystems so if you can't hedge risk you can't take risk so so I think that's
really exciting and I think over the next 10 years we're gonna see a growth and evolution in in the development of
these organizations my sense is is that they'll start small because that's what the law provides where you'll have groups of people probably accredited
because it's the easiest way to begin to experiment you know working through these organizations in order to
hopefully generate the profit which I think is important in order to scale this I think you'll also see related
experiments where people are expanding upon what the folks are doing in the more grant-giving way both for social
good or some other social purpose which i think is equally important maybe oregon exploring how to how to
deal with coops or other forms of organizations that may be more naturally suited to the technology and then I
think over time and hopefully by 2030 we'll have the ability to loosen some of these rules so that the number of
members that can be involved without running afoul of laws in the u.s. at least are not limited to 100 or 250
people or even 2,000 people which are really the thresholds that kind of block the way organizations run and and I
think we're gonna get there I think from a u.s. vantage point just at least according to my analysis and well that's
far from perfect at least I feel comfortable not relying on that that it seems like the u.s. is in a good shape
or is in good shape the limited liability company and the case law that's developed around it is incredibly
flexible and it's completely feasible that you can have organizations that have no members and there's a great
article where shown by um but together and made that argument I
find that very persuasive and I think you can also experiment more broadly in
the US with actually having interests and ads that are not securities I think that we haven't yet had an entrepreneur
willing to take to take that risk and to make that argument but I think that there's good arguments to be made there
and I think uniquely the US doesn't require organizations that have a manager of some sort or some sort of
hierarchical structure I don't know if that's a testament to just our our
democratic republic or the fact that we didn't kind of develop society from a
more feudal base old monarchical base but we at least seem to be one of the
few jurisdictions that promote that and seem to be one of the few jurisdictions
of the size of the United States I like a major economy that promotes that so that all these points to some
encouragement on my part that the US will continue to lead here both of the
regulatory side and going forward and I think that's critically important I think that's important because putting
aside many of our problems I do think the u.s. still has a strong sense of the rule of law although that may be
arguably evaporating over the past couple years but again that's debatable but I do
think that there's a great opportunity for us to begin to experiment here with
that I think the longest the longest term or longer term vision of what that dows may be kind of going forward it's
really just making capital liquid I think Noah did a superior job exploring some of the limitations with with GAO's
which really in my mind were to this idea that information has cost and we can't we can make information move
faster but we can't lessen the cost of information for humans processing it at least at this point I do think it's
going to enable a large pools of capital to form if we thought that the Dow was a
large pool of capital back in the day 150 million dollars I think we can grow by 2030 that pool to be much much larger
than that I think we'll see because the transaction costs have gone down just smaller pools of capital kind of forming
and reforming in different ways we've already seen kind of the core based mechanisms in place so one of the
amazing things about the Moloch Dale project was that they implemented a tool which Vitalik also talked about called
ragequitting which is in a more legal sense just the ability to pull capital
in any point in time so the ability to deploy capital and poet automatically points to this feature where you're
seeing pools of money form pools and money dissipate large pools of money forming maybe they dissipate quickly
more quickly and I think that that just will change the way that we fund things things for organized people earn returns
a whole host of other things and I think we'll probably other real thing that I'm
hope we see by 2030 it's just an opening up of capital markets that risk the globe I think we're we're lucky in the
in the u.s. that we have Silicon Valley and other major capital centers and the rest of the globe doesn't and while that
benefits us I think that hurts a lot of people and I think that dows really represent the future of breaking that
apart I'll leave with one analogy then I'll turn over to the next speaker which is I just think fundamentally one
of the theorems core use cases is capital formation and just like one of the core use cases of a theory of the
internet with e-commerce so I think we've seen various different experiments with capital formation when I could when
it comes to blockchain technology we've had a couple setbacks but I can't imagine given the efficiencies that I
see playing around the technology and using the technology that that's not going to be kind of the feature of one
of the futures of aetherium and I think a great first experiment is delao which
is a lot and purposely named like the dow so it's a venture capital fund we're
doing everything above board when compliance with US law and it will be
launching in about two weeks so we were supposed to launch by this point but given the global pandemic we thought
that that would be a little bit tone-deaf so we decided to take a couple weeks to just let people see what they
stand but I think that's exciting and then we can hopefully continue to grow with the work that you're doing Noah
could it work that John and and others are or you're doing with T org we can
continue to tow this ecosystem so I'm excited be part of it you're here much thank you
Thank You Aaron and just to double check can you stick with us through the end of the session to engage in discussion or
do you know I'm here I know PIM there it's 1:00 in the morning for Primavera but even if it was
1:00 in the morning I'd still be like we're good to go today Isaac okay thanks Aaron so next up um you have
been your name has been invoked a few times Ori Simoni can you introduce
yourself and and tell us about the dorg and so the org is like Labor managed
firm that's run on the gossip framework on ethereum and we incorporated in
Vermont last May as a blockchain based LLC so we remember managed LLC that's
governed by a cow and not the other way around and I can go into that and so Aaron had brought up that dows are
really killer for capital formation and I want to and makes it more liquid so I want to add to that that I think it also
makes labor coordination a lot more liquid and so we're we're more focused on sort of the coordination of labor
some of the stuff that no what was talking about like I'm having goals that different like cells are pursuing and
money money's coming in and it's getting allocated to different people working on different projects and then also voting
power and ownership of the entity is in a liquid way constantly getting distributed to different people working
so I wanted to share something that I
think it was Andrew and Gaza brought up try to screen share here are you getting my screen not yet but I think it's gonna
come okay
sure excellent okay so yeah we you mentioned the robot.txt which I found
interesting because it's kind of we've been working on a similar metadata standard for on chain organizations in a
way that kind of there could be clients front ends that can read this and kind of give you all the proper information
that you need to know what's behind the address so kind of like corporate law gives us registries the different states
for example in the u.s. maintained and in that way you kind of know what you're dealing with and so we were thinking we
could push forward like a metadata standard that doubt across the spectrum
from the ones that are total anarchic or kind of not in the legal world to
projects like allow something that's kind of agnostic the could even even
work on different block chains and so just this is like I don't know a third version or something like that but you
can see basic stuff like name description address maybe like a contact
email the different like web 2.0 platforms that they're on and then you
could have like a legal like field for the yeah the the registration
information if you know optionally if they have that you can have some like parameters that the doubt runs on that
that would be defined by particular protocol that it's using so for example if you're using my lock this would look different than if you're using Dow stack
and then you can have like the dependencies like the code that it's actually running from so this is just an
example kind of like what it could look like and then you could easily kind of like query this kind of and if there's
ever disputes you could easily like look to this to see a reference point that's pointing to let with all the legal
agreements that the enemies entered into for example and so I can jump into like
a quick presentation just to run through some updates from D org I don't want to spend too much time on the Vermont stuff
like our BB LLC because I've talked about that in the past so I kind of get more some like updates on how it's
looked from the operational side running like an autonomous legal entity so Megan
from barely just put some of the data together from our on train data use very ledger accounting software so yeah
kind of like run through this quickly we know cows have certain advantages over normal companies that are interesting
like meritocracy and democracy and transparency there's been a lot of
product innovation and web 3 and ethereum but not so much on actual operation operations so we see a lot of
you know traditional Silicon Valley looking startups pushing all this interesting web 3 stuff software so at
this point we think that we're kind of at the point where why not use it like all the way through not just you know
until operational layer and then fall back to like legacy so that's kind of
what we tried to do starting last year and we found this this statute in
Vermont that was pretty new for running like the material portions of your operations and your governance and
anything you want your ownership shares on chain and like like Aaron was saying you can probably do this with any LLC
structure in the US because it's incredibly flexible in places like Wyoming Nevada Delaware but we went with
Vermont because it gives you that extra assurance that the legislature explicitly says that if you used smart
contracts to define your governance your cap table your operations then then it's
legitimate and so we we launched at Dow on on the SEC framework and incorporated
it with the BB LLC and yeah we can can get more into that later if people are
interested the Dow stock frame work loves you do like reputation weighted voting so you can constantly make proposals to give
someone more reputation or more of the funds that the Dow has and so we use
that for for kind of both both financial decisions like paying people day-to-day
and also for legal decisions like entering into a legal agreement with a new member or with a new client and so
yeah we're just a watchin engineer agency we just work on various projects and aetherium with different like crypto
startups and so yeah this is like a year in kind of what it looks like we're
working with different clients we have like sort of diversified set of clients that
are paying to dab all the time and they were constantly making these proposals to pay out the people delivering on the
client work and so this is what it looks like on the other side on the allocation side so it's pretty distributed like we
started as a group of three and today we're at about twenty reputation holders and more like ten very very active
contributors freelancers at the moment so you'll see this is both our payment
allocation over the last year to different people but it's also our voting power distribution so we for
every like dollar you earn you also earn one share and in the way that we had set it up so the at first you know I had
like thirty three percent voting power because I was one of three initial members but today I have something like
eighteen percent because more and more people have come in and that's diluted me and this is like kind of interesting
because it's also a path to decentralization for projects that start centralized which everyone does and yeah
it's like hyper efficient we're basically just paying you know like a
couple SAS services for like our email client and stuff like that but the
overhead is near zero or remote only we kind of are picking up work coming in all the time from different clients
that's pretty pretty interesting and yeah gas costs are like tiny so yeah
every week we're doing rig dozens of proposals and and at the end of the day it's like a year of that and you've
spent like thirty four bucks and yeah another kind of critique that we get is
oh my god you're dealing in crypto that's so scary so volatile but most of our clients facing us DC or Die and even
we get paid and neath you know comes in fluctuates it goes out we're constantly churning or constantly like
clients are paying in and workers are getting paid so yeah we've basically really haven't lost on the FX this year
at least so yeah the the response has been good clients are happy members are happy too
people kind of like working with us contributors are excited about it
because it kind of gives you the freedoms of independent contracting freelancing with four structures of having like a group
around you and yeah we like I said we use it for contract approvals financial
management and like the reputation distribution and yeah that's my presentation I was gonna show one more
like kind of demo just to give you a feel for like the real like automated
part of things yeah yeah please do boy so you can see my screen still right
you can see all these tabs yeah yes so so yeah I set up this URL
ahead of time that embedded some like information about what you would need is
a new member to kind of sign on both legally and and in terms of ownership shares and and financially so if I click
this it'll take a bit to load but what I'm doing is is auto generating a membership proposal and see so if a
member if someone finds finds out about us online and finds this URL and they're
interested in joining they can click it and what's happening is it's Auto generating this membership proposal of all the fields filled out that's saying
things like by submitting this proposal to joined or I affirm the following I've read the handbook I filled out the join
form I understand my roles and responsibilities operating agreement I agreed the contractor agreement I've
emailed my tax forms to this email yada yada and the ID and it's already asking
for a pre preset amount of reputation maybe some like funds that have to be given in or requested and then you just
you just pop your Etha address into here and then you hit submit proposal and then in that way we have like offer and
consideration of the legal agreements so if this is the offer the person is offering to enter into the contractor
agreement with the org and then once once I hit submit here I'm not gonna do
it but the the proposal would pop up here and then the DAO would would vote
on it and then if that proposal passes you have the acceptance so in that way
we have a legally binding agreement that was just entered into with this with this agency with this legal agreement so
yeah that's that's all I have for now outstanding thanks so there so here we
have with the D Oregon example of kind of a collaborative developer collective with Aron's Wow we had an example of
something more like an investment collective so let's keep moving forward so Primavera
are are you witnessed I think probably not but let's move on to Gaia and
Primavera pops in we'll get it right back in rotation gaia hi it's nice to
finally sort of meet you um you know with images and look for look forward to
hearing your presentation thank you I just want to say I'm fascinated by the
presentations that have been given so far and I'm really looking forward to
digging in further can ever can can you hear me okay my Wi-Fi has been a little
wonky so I just want to make sure okay it's a little bit crackly at times but
you are definitely audible well I'm gonna make my presentation
short and sweet so um this is really going to be a high-level summary of a
recent birth that I co-author on some of you may know one of the co-authors Harry
certain let me just
should work
okay um this is a basically a proposal a nude
Imogen to be considered in in developing a on systems which could include
autonomous entities and you know we respond to this concept you know that we
already talked a lot about privacy but we don't talk so much about mobility so this is kind of a proposal from from
this group about what that what that might mean and what that might look like and we see this as a paradigm for
aligning over interests as we build systems so I just want to kind of
introduce you know why should we be talking to a AI building AI systems
right now in the midst of a pandemic and the something that you know we're we've
been kind of asking ourselves well is this a good time to kind of even try to get attention on a paper like this or on
any like this and just to kind of frame the broader context we some of the
proposals in paper we we were debating
you know these a little bit idealistic I actually am encouraged by some of the
signals of change that we've been seeing around but the response live in 19 and
in nature we see in control set the storms are recovering as that
consumption is reduced and else reduced we see massive grassroots efforts that are being mobilized glue and we see big
changes in even mainstream ideas the Financial Times editorial board just
promoted a basic income I think yesterday or the day before
I guess the underlying question we're thinking a lot about is will this crisis
help to facilitate fundamental changes in the system and therefore could there be more of an opportunity for new ideas
to kind of move into the mainstream so the way I think these conversations matter how is that
automated empties will become more valuable as our daily life is changing and we need them to become more
trustworthy need to have more analysis of sensitive medical data right now
that's becoming increasingly critical so have AI systems that we can really trust
and then looking for ahead Travis where the AI systems have an important a as we
design sort of more resilient infrastructure for our society on all levels so crimps of the paper is that AI
agents do not currently have a fiduciary duty their users so in in the case of
financial advisor a lawyer doctor you have a fiduciary duty to act in the
users best interests if you hear up for an AI system that is intended to serve
your entry or is marketed as serving your interests there's no legal framework that requires that so we are
addressing this with a new concept of AI loyalty our definition is that EDI
systems are loyal to the degree that they are designed to minimize or make transcend or may translate conflicts of
interest sort of the concept here like conflict of interest you know hygiene
um we believe that these systems could
have a significant competitive image and of course an underlying ethical
advantage compared to sims that do not embody this this principle and we think
that this is sort of a potential mechanism for a like long term interest from AI develop and customers and so in
our paper we specifically hone on AI assistance as an area of application
thing that the concept of the Isle oil tea could be a plot in a much broader context and the implications would be
basically in a significant increase in thrust meaning that users would share a
lot of information with their systems I think that another implication is that
interaction between automated systems impact and this would in turn label
appropriate autumn eyes the sharing and coordination I think I'm preaching to the choir here
I'm just gonna I'm into our proposal for criteria for happy would assess whether
an AI system is it could be could be considered royal so one is Val alignment
so it liberally mind to eliminate clear phonics of interests but you course can't eliminate conflicts of interest
completely when do exist the system should transparently indicate the
presence of of the conflict the system goal should be transferred the goal
should be adjustable by the user and then optimally the should be draw from
revealed preferences this is the core concept and on human compatible AI the
major theory of is decision transparency so to the extent that decisions are made
in Italy of the user the decision processes should be understandable to user this is really in part designed to
reduce human cool movement so that it so that users are hated on the relevant
fact bringing the basis for decisions so that they can interpret it data
integrity this is more familiar I think just the provenance of data attribution
and repeating appropriate legal and rights to the originator of course
encrypting another privacy technologies where appropriate with sensitive data and then per an extreme regard for
personal privacy and I think goal so here is just making exploited privacy
risks of any particular option at the moment when that action is taken so
these are kind of our proposals or what we think make sense in terms of criteria to eval the stone could be considered
loyal and we have a versions in the paper for this group in particular legal
framework may be of interest we have a section around sort of what we think potential business models would be that
could be viable we talked about the relationship to the issue of AI alignment and then we have specific kind
of recommendations so we love your feedback on these proposals and if there
are opportunities support efforts to move develop toward this direction we'd
love to hear about those thank you so much outstanding and we just added a
link to to your paper and the shared notes in the wiki so encourage everyone to to read that quickly before the
discussion and so the next the next speaker is John clip injure and John
it's already been your name has already been revoked a couple of times and someone that's been a pioneer in this
space generally but for those of the four people who are familiar with you could say a few words
about yourself and and then dive right in it does it how much time do we have
I just tried trying to get us a sense of um I'm at the time I had to speak
because we're you see are we running it what is what's our closure time you know
with the listed closure time is um 1715 Pacific which I believe is 815 so we
have about a half an hour or something like that okay let's put a little in
context and it's great to be here and with old friends and and and part of my
interest in this is goes back to I'm currently at the Media Lab working in a city science group and came into that
ten years ago through Sandy working with Sandy in human dynamics before that was
that Berkman and we set up with Oliver good enough we set up as I call the law
lab and as interesting computational law did a book called but but so from
Bitcoin to Burning Man and beyond and that was like 2014 and organized a number events around this what I'm
focusing on now is in the city science group and what's really motivated me and
take up Aaron's point is that when you think of your cranium entity what's the
purpose of the entity why are you designing it the way you're designing it the motivation for this and what I call
a reflective mutual series LLC and as the paper I did for the general
computational law and it's it's a fairly long paper and it's a fairly complex concept so I just really touch on some
of the key points because what motivated was our concern about climate change and
feeling among us who involved in this that you really don't have a ten year period it's five years you're going to
have to make massive changes in how capitals allocation allocated and make a
transition from a fossil based economy to a sustainable economy and you're
going to have to create the appropriate set of incentive you're gonna have to create your proba set of ownership it's a huge task it's
gonna have to be done in a relatively short period of time I mean that's our perspective and yes we have the pandemic
and I think that's lit like a warning shot but series of very massive changes we're
seeing systemic changes challenges to every every fabric of our organization
or our economy and institutions so we're taking a pretty radical view and rethinking things in a certain
fundamental so and that thinking his been in conjunction with the work that's
been done with the DCI dmit DCI principally through the work of Martin
Weinstein who I think may be on this call on this conference and he and a
group did something called open solar that's been generalized to open finance and the issue that was presenting itself
was not only how do you attract capital out of a fossil economy but how do you
also deal with the issue of equity of ownership and not generating externalities how do you how do you
create a capitalism is it's very extractive it generates externalities basically those negative externalities
have to be cleaned up by the public sector and that could be the government or the private sector or a nonprofit and
that doesn't work terribly well and so how can you design something that from
it's very beginning does not generate the externalities and captures value and
Riaan and reinvest it in itself and this reflects itself in some of the really
concrete issues around cooperatives and the mutual fund you chew organizations
to the extent to which someone can pay they say they can pay the rent or they
can pay their utility bill but over a period of time they the coop or the
entity an entity could be formed that takes ownership of that and that entity could build up enough equity collateral
they can issue its own set of securities and so the concept of reflexivity here
is based on the premise that you can take outside value reflex we put it back into it and the model for
this is it's a biological model it's they work at my background and my
interest for weilong for 30 40 years has been in complex adaptive systems it's a
lot of work in the in Santa Fe Institute and other areas and books on this is how do you create self-organizing systems
that are scalable or resilient and actually have sort of their own
catalytic process there are metabolism and part of the thinking for this is in smart by Stewart Kaufman who is a
complexity scientist a biologist and looks at what he called catalytic sets
that are not just biological but actually WHMIS of metabolizing energy in
this case it would be capital in such a way that you were able to differentiate that into complex forms that address
substantial issues in societal issues from the point of view of what we're
doing at a city scope or city science the idea is we're interested in sort of creating what we call Civic homeostasis
how do you create robust resilient communities they're not generating
carbon they're not generating negative externalities around the climate but also social externalities and how do you
create incentive mechanisms to keep that inside the entity itself so what become
the thing about a biological organism is that it has a membrane it has a cell it has a boundary condition and how do you
build on that so the concept of reflexive mutual organization is based upon those sets of principles and it's
almost based upon the arbitrage between external forces account Fiat versus
building up any internal value compound value that you can do it's a biological
process I won't go into that either so it is a very different kind of entity we
are working with different parties to implement in the concept of nodes that we called Genesis nodes that's why it's
a series organization not clear that Delaware series Mutual LLC is the right
entity we may not need to do it with a series designation and we be able to do it for the terms of
service agreement is a legal questions around that we have a different kind of governance mechanism more like a mutual
organization such as Vanguard which is a six point five trillion dollar fund
that's owned by its members as funds that has a very lean management
governance mechanism the idea is that you're focusing on what we call positive
rights outcomes and and so your your rights are not so much expressed there
your participation is so much and voting though there is that your rights are a positive rights in the sense that you're
entitled to certain kind of outcomes measurable outcomes and those would be seen in terms of carbon reduction
pollution reduction equity housing things like that we've developed various metrics of that bed that the city
science group and those metrics actually correspond to what are called ESG
metrics that people are familiar with them yes she is a college environment
society and governance metrics are that revaz represent positive outcomes that
major institutions institutional investors are willing to put money on there's literally about 21 trillion
dollars trying to find ways into having these kind of impact investments that
are measurable that they can legitimately do it and meet certain requirements they call sadly requirements so it's it's a new kind of
entity and its really the it's not in your classic capitalism all you what
we've done is taken the concept of the equity social equity idea the capital
equity structure of a start-up and sort of inverted and turn it on its head in a sense so we have whole bunch of
liquidation preferences that accrue to the the organization itself the mutual organization rather to the external
investors the whole objective here is to take external capital pull it in bill
that equity within the collateral with it and be able to issue in your own tokens your own
uh as kinds of asset categories to incentivize different kind of behaviors
and so there's like a micro monetary policy behind this we develop a simulation model and I might use a group
to model those token flows in order to maintain the stability the the outcome
the homeostasis so rather than sort of having profits through shareholders it's
really a concept of homeostasis around certain outcomes they're difficult
design in terms of ESG metrics and this
is very compatible of work that's being done through a group called versus that has but what they call spatial contracts
creating digital twins so the implementation of it is not it's not
quite the stretch as one might think and actually talking to working with no
and discussing with him about what the work that he's done with Republic and how they've been able to do deal with
the compliance issues around securities law is also applicable to this so I'll
leave it with that but that is a a new
kind of entity that I would say that is rethinking the nature of capital
principally to deal not to create the externalities but generate value
internally that can be captured by the organization the coop the mutual group
itself beautiful thank you so much Sean um okay
so let's okay so first let me just double check um creepeth as Primavera joined us for
chance okay sorry
so let's get into the discussion um and John I think your your conversation
which is a good segue into how I'd like to bridge so starting so the the context
of this event is to look into the future about 10 years to 2030 and talk about a
vision for 2030 and how we get from here to there one of
the relevant kind of context of the moment is that almost all business has
suddenly been more or less forced to in a sense go virtual right work from home
and that's that is the catalyst for so many business processes and procedures
and relationships among people how we work and how we how we do what we do how
what our activities are now people are having to find a way to at least make that occur through networks and online
what are the opportunities to do people think from taking this characteristic of
the of the current crisis and and having
that be one of the stepping stones toward adoption of these truly automated
legal entities and can you extrapolate just about that number one and then for
extra credit is there a path like a road map to 2030 where we realize the visions
that you're putting forward yeah I think the answer that I think this is happening much faster than we think and
I think it is accentuated by what obviously that the crisis were in right now but I have a friend who is a company
that he he's doing virtual events and being able to stage and he was he was
really into the 3d modeling the virtualization and he wasn't getting much traction say three months a couple
of months ago now he is inundated by companies that wanted to do virtual
augmented reality events is suddenly this is you know this is top and center he's got 70 different companies that are
coming in major companies that feel they have to make this transition that compounded with this whole work in
digital twins the ability to do with machine learning and imagery a satellite
image you can actually create very high-resolution digital twins of the buildings environments
and people of things and you can actually describe their behavior you can
write contracts around their behavior this business this is accelerating much faster than I would have thought of in that part of
the whole IOT the metrics of being able to five you roll out so there there are a lot of environmental situations and
economic and technological that I think it's accelerating this effort then if you take what's happened to gaming
platforms and you think it's something like unity that is now you can do real
model real-time simulations of physics
and you have over a billion million developers I think that's a way of which
people are going to start to engage the between the physical and the virtual world and if you have a way in which you
can have a representation of yourself that is valid and certified they can
participate in the physical and the virtual identity get the benefits of both of those I think that will
accelerate things so yes I think the circumstances now are laying the
foundation for this I think there's a lot of stuff out there already we see lots of big players who have an
incentive to do this this financial and Senate is in the climate change and
really is when you have someone like Goldman Sachs I need to go to spend some with five at 750 billion dollars in five
years you have Blackrock making their claims there you have P and B Paribas
you have the big institutional investors recognized and they're gonna happen to finance a transition then there's no
better way to do things on and then your innovation through digital innovation through and this is generative designs
things that come out of people just seeing what Autodesk is been able to do and degenerative design so I think and
and the Fablab just kind of stuff that Neil Gershenfeld was doing it's all part
of a common trend yeah Fablab so you could have you could drop
you could have a corporation in a box almost yes
someone saw this wants to speak go for it yes John I think that's absolutely right
sorry I just saw a message I think the other big thing that current climate is doing outside of just forcing people to
go more digital is that we're I think starting to see the glimmers of a digital dollar and and one of the major
limitations I think for what what Ori you're doing what no what you're doing
what other folks in the crypto space are doing is that the assets are not digital well there may not be it may not be that
bad getting paid in u.s. DC or dye or or ether and there's very few digital
assets that have the distribution of traditional fiat currency and I do think we're quite some time away from that and
and to the extent that we can get more assets that are able to be managed via
organizations like like Taos or other computable forms of organizations just
the more experiments can occur you know just if you you know I know lots of
folks are not developers but when you begin to really play around with the technology you really do get that
glimmer but what I think a lot of folks saw with the early internet you see the Capitol moving so fast it's like seeing
bit bits moves so fast across the internet and these dreams of streaming video and streaming you know streaming
commerce just really come into focus so I'm sure Ori you could I feel that a certain degree when you're you know
paying $30 to imagine organization and I think that's only going to accelerate in
the next 10 years as we have more digital you know traditional digital assets kind of move online what that
looks like I think is a multitrillion-dollar question but maybe maybe that takes at least one step
forward over the next couple years yeah
I definitely agree the people working remotely and kind of governments moving
to digitize currencies kind of creates a pull towards towards these things and
then I think another big aspect of the crisis is it's creating a push sort of
away from the system that people are used to this so people are left behind like their corporations that
they work for the government's they're supposed to serve them are just you know just cronies bailing each other out so
people are looking for alternatives people are getting pissed off and frankly they you know any channels for
that rage right now and so you see people on venting on social media
advocating for strikes for rent strikes and other kind of social civic action
and but at the end of the day people feel really powerless so the the the
civic action of the twentieth century isn't gonna work in the 21st century holding up signs and protesting doesn't
actually compel people in power to change what's going on and so I think what's interesting about this moment is
that we are rapidly improving the tools to the point where they're usable by non
technical long developers and so if you if you have this tool set and you're like look you're pissed off and here's
some tools for you to organize and start a start a company that's owned and run by you and thats collecting capital from
all over the world and you don't need you know this major like Walmart to to
manage the like like small businesses can can kind of like Feder eight or
something like that and and have incentives for people to shop there and yeah it's it's like someone you took
opium but if we're talking about a ten year path yeah I think there's kind of tectonic shifts that are pushing people to look for those alternatives we have a
well there's a hand raise from someone named all I could see is all over gee oh oh oh it must be good enough all over
good enough if you're yeah yes whoever
you are okay touchy I recognize your voice great you have the floor hi thank you
a great great to hear all this this terrific work going forward to follow up
on the what what this crisis opens up as an opportunity in addition to private
sector of the public sector is is changing how it operates I apologize for pulling in Vermont
examples that's where I'm sitting the the Vermont has just changed all of
its meeting laws forever for all of the state and the towns the little
Commission's of the the Forestry Commission you know all of these small entities within the state government
they have now authorized remote meeting which has never been done before now obviously that's because of the crisis
but two or three things grow out of that one is that that that folks who would
before have insisted they had to see each other face to face or now understanding that a lot of governance a
lot of governance can migrate into into the web other other kinds of interactive tool and as you see that going forward I
don't think that geni goes back in the bottle I think that you're going to find that the public sector is is eager to
figure out the kinds of dowel like participation so so in addition to the
great work that's going on in the private sector and finance and all that I would urge us also to think about how
we might help the public sector enable this because of those to this kind of question of who's do you know how do you
influence how do you protest all of that kind of thing what we need to do is to figure out how to how to reconstruct those mechanisms of participatory
democracy whether it's you know some kind of town meeting equivalent or whatever it ends up looking like I don't
know what it ends up looking like but I do know that the the system is open and the window is open and will stay open
for a while and some very clever things might come forward anyway thanks again indeed thanks thanks so much Oliver you
know in the late 90s we did a research project between MIT and the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts to see all the just in our state the mass general laws and regulations all the requirements for
in-person presence that that applied to us of marriage was one notarization
certain public meetings we came up with a list of some hundreds that was either explicitly or the wording was such that
it was it seemed to be a requirement such that the activity or the action would be invalid if it if not done like
physically in person you know it might be time to dust that off update it further all the states and
federal government and take a look at you know what are the what are the safeguards and protections needed for to make this a valid and appropriate online
and as you say this crisis is forcing it but maybe in a bit of a haphazard way that's it's time for you know something
more like the uniform law Commission or someone to look at you know how do we update that part of the economy and
illegal obliterate the legal obstacles to the transition well again if I may
the your you say it's haphazard but it's driving it's driving straight forward
the Vermont legislature for instance is in the process of enacting the rules
that will permit it to meet virtually and there's nothing extraordinary in that that's happening all over the place
the feds are talking about it I don't know whether it won't quite penetrate there but yes the we just the Secretary
of State just in the course of two weeks of force through digital notarization remote motorisation that's great yeah I
mean it just and it was interesting because it happened in part because of
older people updating their wills should not get it could not get it notarized unless they
were in some way and and the pressure on that you know turned the Secretary of State has been dragging his feet on that
for a couple years boom you know two weeks rules in place all happening so yeah you know that
accelerated piece of it I'd love to see your your your your inventory because my
guess is that that that in the course of the next six months you know 50% of those will disappear okay you know the
big one we found with some induction into the military so maybe some of them will continue I said I said 50 percent
what more point in view it may be a different military but it has a in the future
Cyber Command yeah exactly yeah I get I think that's a great point about the public sector I do think that
there's a lot also in the funding of public goods that we can learn from what's emerging with Tau's and and other
block chain based ecosystems like the CLR grant-giving model that's working
for good coin where it's kind of a exponential way to fund things that
folks are interested in so yeah I don't know if you've taken a look at that but that could be particularly interesting
especially if there's some damage that needs to be rectified it seems like a pretty efficient way to pinpoint areas
where people actually need new things and then provide you know sufficient funding based on that that demand that's
super interesting just to look at what's been done in dystonia now they're
providing a service now does it help other kind of country they'd go more digital they've done a lot of very good
things the digital state yeah I mean I
think you know the public sector does lead right but to the extent that we
have digital mediums like Oliver is mentioning digital motorisation and
digital voting whether or not that's public voting or not but I do think those are kind of the core core aspects
of governance particularly when you add to it the flow of capital some sort it's
kind of those key substrates that brings it all together and I think the headline
because of the work bed or you know others have been doing and fix some of
the teams that I'm working with and I just think that the code is pretty much there you know like I look at them more
like be to smart contracts and I think about the design space and there's not that much more that's needed for us to
to kind of build some real stuff so you know I wasn't around for kind of the first computing revolution there simple
right they're not powerful technology but you know as we heard the governor of New Jersey calling after COBOL
developers some of those simple systems they they they work really well and work for a
really long time so maybe that's what kind of still in that era okay indeed so
let me throw another prompt out so we're about to experience a almost like a
tsunami of resources through the stimulus act in the United States and
similar measures around the world all focused on getting the economy restarted
so part of that is going to be looking at the you know it'll be almost as
though a fire went through the forests of our economy a lot of companies are going to be bankrupt you know and have
to close and other companies are gonna have to significantly restructure and be reborn where are the opportunities for
the as you say Aaron there's a lot of their tools that are ready or near ready
for prime time for production at scale where the opportunities to inject some
of these tools as enablers for the new wave of companies that are that are
about to need some help for a quick start yes so I think that's a great
question I think one thing is we're seeing struggles already with just a
venture capital markets right and private equity funds you know just the way that they're structured they don't
have capital on hand and instead of capital on hand a lot of their LPS or not providing them capital so folks are
predicting you know at least 80% drops in funding this quarter you know 60%
next quarter and then they're hoping for rebound after that who knows and I think
we also know from history that some of the best companies tend to start when things are at their worst right there's
lots of examples of that and so I do think you know for strong communities like the etherium community which has
hundreds of thousands of developers this could be a great way to actually begin to fund that next generation and I also
think that there's just some really interesting crypto economic innovations from bonding curves to see
our stuff and and other examples where we get better pricing and know better discovery things that that I think could
be immediately deployable and so but I imagine that hopefully MIT
and Stanford could get some grants so that they can continue to explore this type of work to the extent that there's
opportunities there fantastic and I
think it's a lot harder for existing companies to benefit from kind of the
wave of development and the etherion community for example but it's a huge advantage for liking new ventures that
are starting up to be native this new ecosystem I've worked with a lot of companies where we tried to find a way
to like embed blockchain somewhere into their systems and there was just too many bottlenecks you know too much red
tape or much like oh no no no that's that's crossing a line and I really don't see them in my good turn yeah I
think it's the wallets right you need the wallets and until you know putting aside how you feel about Libra or some
of the order you know like Bank coin projects you know distributing wallets into the hands of more folks around the
globe whether that's through browsers whether that's mobile phones whether that's through other means yeah I think
I think that's needed but at the same time and I think you know Chris Dixon and so I was a partner at a 16z so he's
biased in certain ways he's made analogy that resonates in my mind which is the
internet was kind of self-referential like Internet companies are in web-one built and supported other Internet
companies and then absolutely kind of snowballed and grew and grew and grew I think that a similar dynamic is probably
going to take hold and the crypto ecosystem where you know crypto companies are servicing other crypto companies and and then the kind of swarm
continues to grow until it's so large that it begins to disrupt other folks so
that that's that's kind of my working hypothesis whether that's true or not I'm not quite so sure yeah just just
that the the consideration about wallets I think we're actually at this sort of
sea change moment for getting on to get their private keys and such
for instance there's you know a big step forward has been the etherium caste
network where you know before people would need to like set up their Menem a squad and get some ether from an
exchange so they can pay for the gas fees in the blockchain and it's that that ends up being kind of difficult but
now there's kind of a whole new wave of you know wave of companies that are coming out where the smart contracts
we've written in such a way that you have you know a company or another
entity that's paying the gas fees and then people just need their private keys and there's a special way of doing that
where they're their self custody but some are all of the keys is stored
somewhere else in an encrypted way that may or may not be recoverable but it's super easy it's basically just like
setting up a website address but the ownership structure has shifted and
people are you know they have their private keys so that's becoming so much easier now and that technology hasn't
quite bubbled into the applications yet but when it does you basically can like set up what feels like a web address but
it has a full bank account with it so you wanted to build a some kind of basic income system or you want people to have
equity in a company or you want to distribute you know non fungible tokens
or whatever it happens to be that that can be so much easier now because you
don't have to you know the wallet issue so I think that's it that's about to shift like in the next you know three months I think three months I think yeah
I mean I think I think that's a great gas station network is great you know we built on the open both sides like a relay er so more broadly the relay
technology I think is there I think the business model around the relay is tricky that's why it's been a little
under invested in yeah I mean there's like there's enough companies in that space I think one of them's gonna do well there's like a con off you're yeah
yeah so but then the margins are all gonna get squeezed out right so what happens you know I actually think a good
concept would be like a gas station down you know and you know people pulling
capital getting a small fee by paying for other people's gas because yeah so I
think that's interesting I know lots of folks have been thinking about that yeah yeah and then in addition to the company
is sort of figuring it out the the tech is getting easier and easier to do like
I'm basically building that right now like I'm a project and it's like it's
it's hard it's like cutting a path through the jungle but uh but soon there'll be a road you know I mean it's
that's gonna happen real soon yeah they delegated voting standards that if you haven't checked them out that you poor
put together and let a mask it really solves upon that so you can pretty much authorize another person to to take a
smart contract call on your behalf so you sign a transaction and then that binds it to another transaction that
that's going to occur so it works pretty well you get like a handoff them over what
more points of view from anybody so okay
here's a maybe a anchoring question
let's let's jump forward now to 2030 I'd love to hear each of you sound off on
should your what you're working on right now reach fruition and really be in a at
least a first good steady state that's driving it's you know well deployed its
stable its sustainable and its successful sketch out what does that look like and we could just so everybody
gets some talk time we could go right down the list I think and uh know if you
don't mind you're working on this stuff actively right now what is a successful um you know kind of plateau look like in
2030 well I think we're kind of in this interesting phase right now which is
that I think initially in like 20 2014
2015 or a lot of people were like hey all this automated legal and anything is gonna be amazing and like a
whole bunch of people tried to tackle all of it all at once right and so that was sort of the the characteristic
feeling at that moment it's like everybody just dope into it and then we realized there were all these subproblems that were really hard like
oh no now we have these security tokens or we've got you know our voting
protocol doesn't work the way that we hoped it would or you know etc so so I
think we have these other coordination problems so I think what's happening now is that the these have now broken out
into separate projects they're all evolving and I think they're gonna be able to be reassembled again fairly soon
so I'm a bet that I suspect that others
in this call would agree that that there is this sense that like cows are actually now possible like they're
almost becoming like obvious whereas a while ago they really weren't and so I
think I think that's that's really positive development what I'm really interested in seeing you know in the ten
year time frame is these order of magnitude two orders of magnitude
improvements on the human systems you know it's like synthesizers came out and
everybody wanted to like simulate violins you know and at some point people realize that you can make really
different sounds with a synthesizer and those those can be really you know so I'm waiting for for that for for kind of
new ways of approaching problems that we have now to emerge more where we get these kinds of order magnitude
improvement and the one that I'm sort of like hammering on right now is I mentioned earlier is these like
thousands of high-quality decisions within a day or even within a second
that are occurring so that we have a different kind of organization that's
formed and to me that's it's slightly unimaginable but that's kind of the I can't imagine the solution yet but I
know that there can be a solution of that type so that's one the other really
important one I think is rapid high scale sense making for four individuals I feel like we live
in this extremely fragmented the informational landscape that nobody is really able to parse in order for us to
participate in systems that we feel represent our values we have to be able to make sense of things as individuals
because you know in a democratic process is not just that the the collective intelligence makes sense of things is
that you have a point of view about what it was that you what it is that you that would benefit you in that system and so
you as an individual have to be able to make sense of whether your interests are being served so that's that's what I I
think those things will be solved Thank You Noah um Aaron yes Laos or Laos
or a way of life 2030 hit it they say my
screen share yeah okay you know so you know I hope my dream is to watch large
private equity funds and banks pretty much get destroyed by emojis and kind of
this war on the internet so you know this this is you know this is releasing
in the next couple weeks it's fully operational let me just move some things around that you can join as a member you
can contribute either it's completely native the data is getting pulled in by a chain link Oracle so we have Oracle's
involved basically contributing is as simple as I purchased too much but going
through a series of modal's where everything clicks through it's completely anonymous the entire voting
process is completely transparent and both for in terms of previous
investments in terms of failed votes in terms of things that are voting in progress
sorry natural end on this one but look this is I think where things
are going the UX is easy enough now to manipulate it's great to have meta masks involved but this is one of many
projects I think one under explored area kind of Nova's point is that people assume that in order to to start a
project you need to raise capital into a company we actually think and we're
working with other folks including the folks at tornado cash which is that we
really should set up downs to fund open source projects so instead of raising
capital for your company you raise capital for your network you set up a fund for your network off of that and I
think that that's a healthier way to do things so I think you're gonna start to see a whole ecosystem you know this is
all undeveloped or locally as I think it can say you can tell I can put out this
is all coming you're not just gonna see one day you're gonna see hundreds of DAV's for projects that want token-based
ecosystems they're not going to be all maintained by the several company that
are developing the core underlying protocols and I think you're gonna start to see you know hundreds if not
multiples of hundreds of millions of dollars flow into the space just like we saw in multiples of hundreds of millions
of dollars flow into the token sale space and the nice thing about it is there's not really any regulatory
blockers at least in the US and it largely aligns with what yes and see how
the SEC views things right which is I get accredited investors to pull their
capital and then and then you can release a token I also think that there's a lot of opportunities and I
know know if I spent a lot of time with reg CF but the recent proposals related to rigsy off I think a huge benefit for
dows and being able to kind of supplement what I just showed with an accredited unaccredited ester sitting
together I think it's gonna blow things open even larger so I'm pretty bullish
about that and bullish about this this idea that memes can take down banks like
winking emoji should take down the banks okay thanks Aaron or II D orgs are the
way of business 2030 and sketch it out yeah I would describe it in simplest
terms as proliferation of sovereign collectives so organizations that are
serving different purposes like political parties labor unions company's investment funds and there's
just hundreds of thousands if not millions these organizations and you can join different ones if you meet the
eligibility or you can start your own and you're a member of many different ones and that they kind of take care of
all your needs you contribute capital labor to them and yeah that kind of is
this the social safety net or the the economic structure that's keeping things
running rather than one where people feel kind of disenfranchised and just kind of choosing between lesser evils
and having very very limited options in terms of how to spend their their life and their their efforts so I think the
pluralities is the the core of it where no one was getting to the point that about synthesizers being used for
nonviolent sounds so yeah if people are rapidly iterating experimenting with
just their creativity is the bound for how their group how their organization
is gonna run then you should see kind of like this evolutionary process of a
couple models being really popular and and ultimately what I think this would
lead to is a society that's more resilient so right now we're seeing the
lack of resilience in our in our world and I think that's because we get we get with like mono cropped our
organizational structures we have like one or two or three like a very like variations and sub variations of those
that are dominating the like politics and economics so if you have like permissionless innovation you would have
plural ism and I'm hopefully resilience from that and higher quality of life
very here what may it be so um Gaia um I
understand your you know what your framing here with AI and kind of almost
a fiduciary is I'm still somewhat early but could can you sketch out a vision
for what what would what would the world be like if that were the norm and just one little thing that we've been
thinking about at the MIT computational law report where if you could address it
I would be great and what pressure is let's say we had AI or or even an automated entity that
based in was performing the functions of a law firm okay what does it look like
to have the fight the the duty of loyalty and care and the other fiduciary duties to the client and how do you
address things like the biases that come in to AI and and identify when they may be suddenly different from what's in the
interests of the client but that's just a bit of a thought that we're starting to have now but if you could just sketch
out how would the world be different and what would it be like if we we could have really adopt your point of view and
that's how a eyes worked okay so I think
we can stipulate that the world would be way better your house a curry maple and
point Aaron yeah I think I think that point is important especially as we see like maker which is pretty autonomous it
may not be advanced AI but it could be an increasingly important part of a crypto ecosystem right those smart
contracts operate in a fairly autonomous and increasingly automated way with very little human input but if it's
effectively like a decentralized central bank sitting on top of ethereum maintaining a stable currency what what
duty do the developers in the event the other organizations that are affiliated with it what duty so they had to the
public right we saw like a little glimpse of a crypto financial crisis
when it when it had a five plus million dollar shortfall despite over collaboration you know indeed and and
just since your since you're taking the role I'm gonna use you as the foil if I may so then should some extent you've
got you know people who are we're powering these things in your in your system they're making just you know
voting decisions and collectively making decisions but there's also assumptions bias as if you will order more neutrally
priorities and it's just other assumptions that are baked into the code um what
how does one evaluate those and then you know and basically it matched them to see how many of them correctly support
and reflect the interests of the client that that is being served as though you were applied you sherry kind of trying
to neutralize your opinions and assumptions and really understand the points of view and the priorities and
the and the you know the interests of that client and serve them is there is there a way to disentangle these things
I think yeah that's a really great question I would say the only advantage to developing smart contracts is that
they're a little bit simpler in terms of the code base so there's probably there are obviously biases whenever you
translate you know from natural language or from human to machine and I think
lots of academics have documented that well but at the same time there's what's
happening at the core function is a little bit more like a developing hardware or some sort of circuit it's
doing a pretty simple task you know like pool money you know if more than X number of token holders say
during this period yes then you know output token you know took collected
tokens to party a received back you know other token from party P so while there
may be some by season that it's a little bit narrower narrower then I think types
of biases that may manifest with more advanced artificial intelligence systems so I think that's fortunate but that
being said you know when we were working with a mean Suwannee and the medic cartel folks putting together Maliki to we made decisions about how much we
should bake into the smart contract yeah you know we collectively decided that it was best to kind of push some of those
those more nitty-gritty questions to their application layer to push it to
the edges where we thought it would make more sense to deal with some of the advanced logic that folks may want to
the tech near depending on their particular perspective or the use case through the community that may be
deploying the underlying code so we tried to really look at it like like a circuit board right that we're kind of
implanting on top of aetherium as opposed to you know some complex machine learning
highly autonomous AI related system and not just cuz that's infeasible but also
because we thought that was the right decision great so it's a design pattern but a
push things to application layer and closer to the people in the context that that you want doesn't work and reflect I
think that's right yeah I don't know whether one of their folks think about that but that felt right we have another
folk well I think we're getting near the end so I want to make sure that John has his moment in the Sun to extrapolate on
on your vision of 2030 well I mean I I think a little different perspective I
mean I I'm I'm I see the technology more as the means here I think I I I'm I'm
concerned about certain financial environmental shocks like I think it has
shaped the environment and the acceleration of what's important and what I'm particularly in so I do like
this idea of a network of nodes or semi-autonomous nodes that are gonna
replace a more centralized infrastructure I think we have a new kind of infrastructure I think you begin
the ideal is not only AB decentralized identity and data but also have
verification techniques that therefore your store trust and their networking I think they're ways of doing that but I
think the biggest challenge is recalibrating the economy from a fossil to a sustainable and have an asset have
a currencies that are backed by provable sustainable assets rather than fossil
rather than oil be they petroleum-based and so I'd like to see the transition of
capital go into a whole new kind of currency system that is based upon
sustainability and I think that's the challenge we have I think there's a way
of doing it's just but I I think that is going to be the the big challenge that I
will drive a lot of the technology adoption so that that's true north and
at least now we know what to navigate toward so if if Tony and the other organizers will permit are there any
someone trying to speak earlier were there any other final thoughts or questions or ideas on that was the time the the point
I was trying to Erin's great points worth was that the the best thing about these circuit boards that we're building
is they're totally exposed it's open source and that kind of spells a lot of the problems that you were bringing out
Dazza about making sure like that the biases are not you know hidden so you
have this like open communities that are vetting these things and if there's something wrong or something
misinterpreted or something that someone disagrees with they can just post online about it and say hey I don't like the
way they did Moloch would be too I'm gonna make Molly could be 2.8 and I'm gonna change this and this and that and
that's that's what we've already seen happen and I think that gives you a pretty good guarantee of like the direction where it'll go
beautiful um Joe help I just add on to
both their pointin that in terms of the
system engineering approach and John mentioned it in the work that I've been doing with this formulation our modeling
and simulation work which is bringing you know it gives you the opportunity to bring in some of the other theories say
from game theory and mechanism design and as a related thing put establish
those requirements test them out and evolve the design before you necessarily go out and actually implement it but by
doing that you've got a baseline which can then feedback from empirical data of
the actual actions of the smart contracts and interactions that are occurring which come in subsequently
improve the design and so you can always step back to that to make a decision
about whether or not the appropriate design choices have been made from this
review I agree that totally general Zhai those genetic algorithms you could
iterate through generations and test them that that's to me inevitable right
now test no sir adapt overcome so and so
there you have it some some great view on the concept of automated and
autonomous legal entities are some of the issues and options and examples of I think some of the leading projects in
the area they're making it happen and a view into the future of how these new
capabilities could play out to become the way of life in 2030 so thank you to
all the panel and thanks to everybody who spoke up and we hereby officially hand a baton back to Tony and the
organizers thank you so much everybody to all of you some incredible discussion
and again to Aaron's point really great to be doing it with a community of
friends we who've been as we've been hearing meeting for for several years
now and some of the some of the pieces I just wanted to pick up on John John you
you said it at the end in particular this notion of a currency system based on sustainability I mean it's nice that
we sort of ended back up on there because that was very much you know part of where we started off with some of the
discussion of the California level and then looking into the potential for the
regulation driving some of the buy-side activity that might then lead to some of
these capital ships happening and then if the tools are in place and we can sort of align some of these these sort
of grand and narratives that are possible right now then yeah it's it's it's really
interesting now this next step we have where we're taking part in this collective process together in the open
I think to what already was saying you know there are certain things that are potentially slower but the the the the
shift is changing and they're us and fundamental benefits to having the view of many people upon the things that have
been built in the open and and that was the point I just wanted to make in terms of the the algorithms and yet to what
extent that they can be considered loyal this was an idea that deser you and I were talking about in terms of having a
repository of algorithms as part of the MIT comms although report that then also potentially looking into some of the
mechanisms we currently use to see whether fidelity has been maintained we
have the adversarial system in the courts and people can back and forth over whether someone actually did
fulfill their duty of interest and again to the extent that we can have algorithms subjected to that same sort
of adversarial system to determine whether you know they were programmed with the kind of loyalty and interest in
mind I think there are a lot of these hybrid systems where we're looking at
the the context and the framing of human value systems and to what Randall was
talking about going to the local communities the vulnerable communities the ones that are seeking we're seeking
to serve and then asking them what is considered value helping them to be the
governor and his voice as part of these systems that we're creating and I think that's part of this broader issue around
data governance is whose data are we actually measuring is it just the kind of data that we're getting from these
these traditional sources or are we opening that up in the case of what Roberts been working on with the data
Commons project - data coming from citizens data coming from indigenous communities data coming from the people
who are out there measuring the actual health of the Ecology's and ecosystems were part of so there's a whole bunch of
stuff that we talked about
