Well, thank you for having me. I'm very interested in the work you've been doing lately. There are so many papers you've been writing. To get into that, though, I want to think about your personal trajectory because the papers that I want to talk to you about are a lot about cognitive computing, active inference, modeling, technology, and AI. However, I seem to have discovered or heard that you started in more humanities and sociology and even something called sexology, which I'm not sure how to define exactly. Could you help me?

I'll start by defining what sexology is because it is a concern that sexologists themselves coming out of university are trained to answer. Oh wow, okay, I'll start with that and then I'll tell you about my path. Thank you. Sexology is basically an amalgamation of a lot of fields. You can go biology, psychology, anthropology. We do a lot of sociology as well, sometimes linguistics, sometimes media studies, and effectively it's about the topic itself. Anything that touches on anything related even tangentially to sexuality, like pregnancy or diseases, it can be couples therapy, it can be well-being. These are all the topics that are touched on, and so we dissect these topics from multiple aspects and try to find the connection points between the fields that find areas of, I want to say synergy, but mostly impact. What we are more and more going towards in the social sciences field is a psycho-ecological-biological approach where you can't just see one in isolation. You have to take it all into account, and that creates a problem because it's a great desire, but you don't have the right bridges, the right paths between the different fields of study. Sometimes the languages don't match, sometimes we think the languages match but really we're talking about different things, and sometimes the methodologies themselves aren't even aligned, so we couldn't even try to measure the same thing if we wanted. That goes beyond the problem of scale. Oftentimes when you talk about a field, we're talking about related things but they're acting in a different scale. For instance, we're talking about psychology and then sociology. In general, we think we're talking about phenomena that act on, say, the individual scale, and then we're talking about topics that span multiple people, multiple individuals, and then even institutions and countries that become their own groups. We are lacking the tools to understand the ways in which these things interact. So that's, I think, how I started my path and where I am today.

Yeah, I can see that. I started in sexology because I was interested in psychology, but I didn't want to do just what my understanding of psychology was at the time, more than 10 years ago. I really thought that I wanted to get into something practical and useful that would get to the root of what is being a human being. To me, sexuality was something fundamental that spoke to the deep connections that we can make with other people and therefore something transcendental about the way that we relate to one another. Unfortunately, I was a bit led down. The field is not what I thought it was. It mostly talks about communicable diseases and the kinds of things you do when you're pregnant and what happens to your body. All of this is massively important but not exactly what I went into it for. So then I did my masters thinking let's push this a little bit further, let's go into culture, let's try to understand how culture is this sort of framework that shapes our perception of reality and therefore our perception of each other and how we might exchange through these cultural artifacts. I got a little closer to where I wanted to go, but then again I was limited by the fact that the fields are hazy and a little bit blurry. They mean to be blurry on purpose because they mean to be inclusive and try to not apply a frame of reference that is not appropriate to phenomena that is poorly understood and that may not be where the researcher is coming from. They acknowledge that there is a bias from being human and existing in the world that you can't really get away from, and so we try to acknowledge and pull the bias away a little bit by keeping things a bit blurry, not defining too much, letting the definition stem from the people, the cultures you're studying. But that doesn't give us a lot of explanatory power, it doesn't give us a lot of predictive power, and so it stays a bit there. It's like, okay, let's make a description, it's beautiful, it's poetic, it's abstract, we can't do anything with it. I find that that also leads to a perception from the, let's say, hard sciences, the life sciences, that it's useless, that it's not even science. Oftentimes we separate these sciences because they don't even consider social sciences to be a science. I'm saying that it's a broad "they," not everybody thinks that way, but I've really encountered people who wouldn't even qualify the humanities as a science. So I was a bit flustered by that. I wanted to go further, I wanted to define what constituted building blocks, and anytime I mentioned the word ontology I was met with heavy criticism because they were like, no, no, no, ontology is an essentialist concept, we are not essentialists here, we are constructivists. I believe that, I believe that things are constructed, I believe that culture shapes the way we engage with reality and that culture itself is a construct of interactions and phenomena, which is why I'm very interested in neomaterialism. But I don't believe that this means you can't come up with essential processes, essential building blocks that lead people to potentially predictively make certain assumptions or predictively think in a way that will lead them to act in a certain way. So that's how I got into trying to think further and find paradigms that were heading in that direction. I found predictive processing. I was engaged a lot with a community at that time that was really involved with AI. Even though I was part of that community, at the same time I was learning how to program. I built a company, a sex tech company. We were doing, at that point in time, web development, but therefore I was getting more interested in it. We were linking patients with sexologists who wanted to give them care across the country because one of the main issues is access. In rural areas, you don't have access. But because I was learning how to program, because I was learning about this community and AI and their concerns, I started reading about cognitive theories that had these building blocks even though they weren't specifically interested in social sciences for now. That's how I fell into the work of Maxwell Ramstead and Karl Friston, who were starting to discuss niche construction, which was very reminiscent of ecological theory, which I was very familiar with having studied in my masters. I was seeing that they were making these connections, and I brought into the field the notion of social scripts. We formalized this, and now we have some degree of the building blocks. The missing piece still to some extent is how you map across scales to get an emerging feature because active inference is scale-free, but it does give you emergence per se. You still need to understand the historicity of a system in order to understand how certain things emerge at a given scale through some attractor dynamics.

Okay, wow, there's so much in there, and now I can sort of understand how you got into this because it is, there's a kind of strange set of constraints in both these areas that you're in. I mean, I've kind of been in both too, and more philosophy, but I think it's similar in a way. We were trying to take account of multiple perspectives, like something like constructivism that you said, where we kind of understand, having read so deeply and tried to see from so many perspectives, that everyone's got a little bit of a different trajectory. Even when we're in a shared space and looking at the same object or in the same encounter, we're perceiving it differently. So you kind of start with that, and then you feel as if you can't really put anything seemingly objective or ontological onto that. Then on the opposite side, in science, it seems almost, this is all, I'm generalizing in a big way, but it seems like we take away all of that stuff and try to get to something that's very distilled that will kind of work no matter what. That also ends up in a strange constraining place, which I think something like active inference is starting to explode a bit. It kind of, for me, has to do with the possibility of modeling. To get into this a bit, I wonder, are you the one who brought in the idea of phenomenology into all of this? Because I've started seeing that word coming a lot, and I wondered, did you study some of that early on, or was that someone else?

So I'm not the one who brought it. That was definitely Anil Seth, Maxwell Ramstead, and a group of other researchers who really started getting familiar with this. They wrote a paper, I think, on the computational accounts of generative passages. This is not the right title, I'll send you the paper later. But they started it, they were very interested in a computational phenomenology. I am also interested in it, and I've done some work in that field. My main interest was how phenomenology becomes shared. So intersubjectivity and how it can become shared is through the common constructs that we have that allow us to parse reality at all. Those can be very basic, like time and space. You start with that. From those basic constructs, then you extend on qualitative expectations, and those qualitative expectations then become sort of constrained and patterned. That's how you get to potentially scripts and culture and language and anything like that, that has something that can be hooked onto, that allows us to compute further than just the momentary thing that's happening.

I don't know, I just want to say something and see what you think. I feel like in a way we're kind of stuck in a flat world understanding where, let's talk about something like sentient behavior, which is sort of what we're trying to understand in a way, right? Or what you guys are trying to understand with active inference modeling and so on. This goes into cognition, maybe you can correct me on that. But in a big kind of way, we're trying to understand sentient behavior and cognition and all these bigger issues come out of that, of how communities form and different sort of protention and so on. But it still seems like to me when we talk about it, maybe just in everyday life, when we think about behavior or cognition, we still have a linear sort of model of, you know, we start with a cell and we end up with AI and it should all fit together on a kind of line somehow. I feel like what you were kind of expressing with the humanities and this constructivist multi-dimensional view is very hard to kind of fit into that way of thinking or modeling in science. But I feel like your papers, especially the ones on scripts, the polimous idea, and the, I mean, there's many, many things where I'm starting to feel like it's opening up and becoming multi-dimensional. I don't know, just saying that, does that, what does that, correct me or how does that strike you?

No, no, I think it resonates a lot. I mean, the problem that we face with science is that you're trying to establish causality. That's the thing, right? It's easy to establish correlation, but causality is tough. So what you're trying to do is move away all the possible noise to find one strand of possible causal relation. So obviously you want to try to make it as linear as possible, and ideally you want to make it reductionist because then it's simple, right? If you can start with a thing, you can just kind of start it and it'll become what you need with this one principle you have. So that would be ideal. But again, this is what I was saying about the emergence structures that only occur at a given scale because we can't yet predict this very well. We are unable to fully grasp how different factors come in, but we are indeed interested in it. I think that's what Varela was trying to get to with the ecological sciences. We are trying to do the same right now. Active inference is basically also heading towards having a proper understanding of how different kinds of observations lead to some types of beliefs. Those can be obviously as varied as you'd like. They can take in different kinds of factors, different kinds of scales, and they feel like because it's being applied in different fields at the same time, we are getting some way to sort of hook all these things together. But we haven't quite yet found the proper way to hook them. We have a language, we have a common language, active inference, we have a common set of processes which eventually all lead back to cognition and fundamental principles of how information is encoded on boundaries, which itself is pretty fundamental. So in a sense, it's reductionist in that sense, but it doesn't necessarily entail that there are no emerging features. The key, I think, what someone will have to come in and do is find properly how these things can be connected. What my work is trying to do is show that the scales are an illusion. That's the work that Max Ramstead started. I'm trying to show that even the internal-external boundary idea is just a function of measurement. It's also just an illusion. So if we start to understand this and we can cast away these artificial boundaries, then maybe we can find the true way in which things interact and therefore the ways in which different modeling ideas that are in active inference can connect to one another. But we're very far from finding the answer. A lot of work still has to be done.

I do feel like what's happening is that there's a scaffolding of something like mathematics, but also just language and description that's come towards understanding some very basic things like how a body encounters the world. With active inference now, through mathematics but also through English or whatever language we speak, we can start to talk about it. It might not be exactly the right way, but we can think of it as minimizing surprise or basically a body moving through its encounter, aligning to those regularities, and then when something is against those regularities, having a kind of a different response. You could probably explain it better. Once we can start to understand this a little bit, is it more possible then to begin to understand that multi-perspectival or constructivist idea that every agent would be a different spatiotemporal position, of course, and thus would have a different encounter even as many of these regularities are shared?

Precisely, that's exactly the point. I think this is why this notion of objectivity is flawed by nature. Objectivity shouldn't mean what we generally think it means. Obviously, like you said, any body in the world will necessitate a different perspective if only because I'm looking at this rock from here and you're looking at it from here. So our experience of the rock, our regularities related to the rock, will be ever so slightly different. The reason we have a language is because we're constantly trying to collapse these differences by hooking up to common experiences and trying to peel away what constitutes an error of the difference between our perception. That's what communication is. We're confronted with this never-ending paradox that what do we hook onto? At one point, there's going to be an irreducible difference in our experiences. I think that's what Slavoj Žižek is trying to get to. Whatever you think of him as a scholar, he does sort of point at this idea that at the core there is nothing because we can never, it's a never-ending, I think Derrida is kind of going in the same direction, it's a never-ending swapping of different things which there's nothing behind it. I think the answer lies in phenomenology and the fact that we're not individuals that have seen only one thing and that we are capable of sort of placing ourselves temporally within the perspective of another agent. Because we're capable of doing this temporal swapping, we're also capable of abstracting away what might constitute some degree of difference and only focusing on this statistical regularity that we both experienced. It's because we are temporal agents and not simply agents that only focus on one point in time. That being said, math isn't sufficient. That's why phenomenology here is critical. Qualia in itself and understanding the relationship between matter and information and how matter translates to a representation is not yet a fully solved question. I think it's going to be the, I mean, it's always been the critical question, right? It's always been the question, but we're so close.

I think there's two things that come to mind there, and it's back to that in one way that flat land thing I was trying to say where I think we're smooshed into this binary way of thinking. This is a lot about beyond dichotomies, and you've already sort of pushed us past them quite a few times in the way that you're trying to talk. But I do think like the two things are, one is this self-other thing, right? I can see what you're saying about and all this, there's nothing there, we could see it that way, but we could also see it that we have a kind of a strange idea of what we are, that we've taken the Markov blanket a bit too seriously for good reason to survive. I mean, we couldn't have even gotten here if we hadn't. So it's not to say that we did something wrong, but we're in a different place now, right? That maybe we can reimagine what is the self actually and what is the body actually, and we can start to understand that there's a power in that community. You write a lot about community intelligence as almost the only kind of intelligence. In a way, if we could have a different realization as the spatiotemporal agent that we are, it might shift a bit what's possible in those realms. I think that's also connected to that flat world sort of understanding that we have in the modeling too. If we could understand that everyone has this unique spatiotemporal trajectory from birth to death, and if we could model it somehow really, like literally, we would see that there's so much overlap and that there isn't a gap actually between all of this stuff. It's just how in the world do we visualize that and model that and put language on that?

Yeah, I mean, I think we're getting to the point of like, do we need to recreate the universe to understand the universe, right?

well thank you for having me so I'm very interested in the work you've been doing lately there's so many
papers you've been writing and to get into that though I want to think about your personal trajectory because the
papers that I want to talk to you about are a lot about cognitive Computing and active inference and modeling and
technology and Ai and all these sort of subjects however I seem to have

because what we are more and more going towards in the social sciences field is
psycho eological biological approach where you can't just see one in isolation you have to take it
all into account and that creates a problem because it's a great it's a great desire but you don't have the
right Bridges the right paths between the different fields of study such that
sometimes the languages don't match sometimes we think the languages match but really we're talking about different things and sometimes the methodologies

they mean to be inclusive and try to not apply a frame of reference that is not

appropriate to phenomena that is poorly understood and that may not be where the researcher is coming from so they

flawed by Nature objectivity shouldn't mean what we generally think it means
obviously any like you said any body in the world will necessitate a different
perspective if only because I'm looking at this rock from here and you're looking at it from here so our
experience of the rock our regularities really Rel ated to the rug will be ever so slightly different the reason we have
The Complexity of Modeling Cognition
a language is because we're constantly trying to collapse these differences by hooking up to Common experiences and
trying to peel away what constitutes an error of the the difference between our perception that's what communication is
we're confronted with this NeverEnding Paradox that what do we hook
on to at at one point there's going to be an irreducible difference in our experiences I think
that's what slavo xek is trying to get to whatever you think of him as a scholar he does sort of pointed this
idea that at the core there is nothing because we can't we can never it's it's
an a NeverEnding I think Dorito is kind of going in the same direction it's a
NeverEnding swapping of different things which there's nothing behind
it I think the answer lies in in phenomenology and the the fact that
we're not individuals that have seen only one thing and that we are capable
of sort of placing ourselves temporally within the perspective of another agent
and because we're capable of doing this temporal swapping we're also capable of
abstracting away what might constitute some degree of difference and only
focusing on this statistical regularity that we both experienced and it's
because we are temporal agents and not simply you know agents that only focus
on one point in time that being said math isn't sufficient that's why phenomenology here
is critical qualia in itself and understanding the relationship between matter and information and how matter
translates to a representation is not yet a fully solved question and I think
it's going to be the I mean it's it's always been the critical question right it's always question but we so
close I think there's two things that come come to mind there and it's back to that in one way that flat land thing I
was trying to say where I think we're smooshed into this binary way of thinking this is a lot about Beyond
dichotomies and you've already sort of pushed us past them quite a few times in the way that you're trying to talk but I
do think like the two things are one is this self other thing right I can see what you're saying about and all this
there's nothing there we could see it that way but we could also it that we have a kind of a strange idea of what we
are that we've we've taken the marov blanket a bit too seriously for good
reason to survive I mean we couldn't have even gotten here if we hadn't so it's not to say that we did something wrong but we're in a different place now
right that maybe we can reimagine what what's what is the self actually and what is the body actually and we can
start to understand that there's a power in that Community you know you you write a lot about Community intelligence is
almost the only kind of intelligence and in a way if we could kind of have a different realization as the spot
temporal agent that we are it might shift a bit what's possible in in those Realms uh and I think that's also
connected to that flat world sort of understanding that we have in the modeling too that because you you could
if we could understand that everyone has this unique spao temporal trajectory
from birth to death and if we could model it somehow really like literally
we would see that there's so much overlap and that there isn't a gap actually between all of this stuff it's
just how in the world do we visualize that and model that and put language on
that yeah I mean I think we're getting to the point of like it do we need to recreate the
universe to understand the universe right well we're sort of doing it right with digital twins of
everything there like it's a lot of people are like well you need to make a map not a territory and it's like well
maybe what con constitutes the map that allows you to understand what is
fundamentally just a map right like literally everything you perceive is just a map so what we're trying to get
to is as close to a map as a map is it's It's So eventually exactly that's what I mean by if we can understand it's both
that's the dichotomy it's either a map or it's a territory that's the way we think right now it's either I or other I
mean but it's so hard for us to open like that's the cognitive shift where's the third space or or even the multiple
space where both of those are okay you know map and territory are not a choice they're different ways of understanding
a process that's kind of inseparable no absolutely and I mean again it's like
this map territory idea gets back to again information and and matter and
effectively there may not even be a real difference between information or matter it now we're getting into like like
physics and I'm not going to go there too much I will refer people to Chris Fields if they're interested and he will
have much better things to say than me but effectively I think what we can what we
consider to be a territory at a given scale is just a map at another or and and and so that distinction is really
just a function of your perspective and the way that you measure reality at this
at this point in space and time but it's still important that doesn't mean it's not like it suddenly becomes meaningless
right you know that's that's kind of what I mean as well like I feel like people put veillance upon certain terms
like you you had to sort of Shield yourself from criticism by saying it's okay that we've made this blanket
important it was yeah of course it is every every process is effectively natural just by virtue of existing so
shouldn't put a label on it what we should every time we qualify something as bad or good it's relative to an
objective that we had and that is being hindered by this thing and so you could
say that relative to this thing this is not helpful in this local scale but if
you blew it up to maybe 10,000 years maybe it would be because maybe this is a calling mechanism or something of some
kind so like we don't we can never say something as blanket as that we can identify tractors relative to a state we
have identified as preferable right now from our perspective but obviously these
Beyond Dichotomies: Self, Other, and Community
things change so if you're talking about the distinction between like or or the ways in which we are focusing focusing
on what constitutes our Mark of blanket I agree and I don't think this is a new idea or that that we need to focus on
the community I think religions at least a lot of them have been saying this for a long time I'm not going to talk about
judeo christianism although you know there's interpretations of it in that sense I'm really talking about about
more about Hinduism and Buddhism uh and the religions that preceded them it was
very much about this idea that this this Mark of blanket is an illusion you are
hyperfocusing on what constitutes the ego and you're you're kind of missing the the force for the tree and if you
understood that this boundary can be relaxed that you can sort of shed that even in your own mind which is uh
something that I know Lara sened writes a lot about about meditative practices yeah yonas magu as well um you
can relax these and effectively your your feeling of boundary goes
away maybe effectively your boundary does go away because boundary is a function of measurement to some extent
so yeah I I think this isn't really a new idea I think a lot of our scientific
Concepts have been like largely influenced by these ideas I think it
would be I think a little lot of hubis of us to say that we've come up with this in in effect like fuku kind of
nailed it alther as well we never really get away from prior philosophies or ideologies kind of like build on top of
them even if to push them down so it's the same thing here I think the one is all or all is one is definitely Central
to this idea it's just that now we have very formal math to put on top of it sure I mean even kind of what something
like what slav is saying and and the Buddhism could be understood as different ways to a similar place in a
sense I mean all of us are in a way trying to grasp it and also at the same time changing it but as you were saying
that it it does make me think that there is a importance to and understanding that the representation which I think is
what is usually meant by map isn't the process I don't know I think you might push back on that or maybe maybe you
agree but I do think sometimes we confuse the representation of all of this like the actual maths or the
language or the image or the marker itself with the action that that marker
is creating in the world do you see any distinction there or do you still just kind of say it would all be you know the
same I'm not sure I understand the question I I I feel like I might have a ningling
but I can answer one part and then you'll have to maybe clarify I can explain if you so to me a
representation can be a process the Press is the process of representing and
representation is simply a momentary byproduct of this this time of
representing and you could qualify a representation as let's say a manif F or
a path but it's still a function of this action of representing and therefore I
don't think they're differentiable like for instance the self I know that there's been a lot of theory that that
push in that direction suggesting that the self is selfing it's it's it's it's
not a thing which exists it's a it's a process of engaging with reality and
through the boundary therefore having a sense of what constitutes what you need
and how you can act relative to what you need and what are the constant elements
or or more consistent elements of what you need over time and that's why we have a sense that something core to us
remains but over time we change we can see that nonetheless you are not the person you were 10 years ago hopefully
so can you maybe clarify your question like the ship of thesis a bit you know all the parts can change but there's a pattern that remains I think I really
mean it in a literal sense I mean of course this word representation in Neuroscience we use it one way in philosophy we fight about it in another
way it's like but I really mean it as representing so let's try to go back into the personal a bit like something
you know about with with social media or something where there's an image that that is itself not ever static but that
we might confuse that image with the actual trajectory to which that image is
connected I guess you know yeah okay so that's okay so there's multiple ways to
tackle this question in neom materialism the idea would be that everything is
about how things interact so effectively you should always separate
the interacting elements but at the same time there is nothing that exists prior to that interaction so in that
sense the image is its trajectory there is nothing that precedes its trajectory
because that it's not it's not a thing in itself it's a thing which has effects
in the world there is another way that you can consider it which is there are multiple paths that can be
taken and will sort of find a connection Point even if they are not aiming from
the same direction and they're not going in the same direction in that case you could say well yes okay so that point
here is essentially meaningless because you could have taken it from that vector or that vector and therefore the image
itself doesn't necessarily contain anything which dictates the vector you're going to take so I'm gonna I'm sort of G
to um caveat that in two ways the first way is that yes you could have taken
multiple vectors but there is a finite number of vectors that go one it's not exactly true but let's assume that given
some regularities there's a finite number of vectors relative to all the other vectors that go through that point
so it it is constraining in any case it is constraining for instance an image
will be perceived and I know this sounds silly by people who can perceive it which means anybody else who who can't
probably will not be affected by the image in the same way so there is a regularity here there is a constant sure I there's affordance as a insect's not
gonna you know that's right encounter that the same way but the second thing is there's other regularities like for
instance you could say that this is a pink shirt this is just a pink shirt
there's nothing in the shirt that says anything more than it's a pink shirt it's not even really a shirt actually
it's just cloth but I know that it's pink you know that it's pink and most men in North
America know that it's pink they therefore most likely will not wear this sort of cut with the shoulders and the
Exploring the Concept of Representation
pink some might but in regularity they will associate this very traditionally with femininity and you could say well
it's not contained in the shirt it's like well it's true but the historicity can't really be abstracted from
everyone's cognition because they exist in a world where that historicity shaped their cognition so it's it's not quite
true that the images should be separate from their trajectory because part of their trajectory was already defined by
the by the by the patterns that we gave them so I I don't know I hope that answered the question to some extent I
The Self as a Process
mean it's it's more just a topic I try to explore but yes I mean I love what you're saying it's just I guess my I
think there's something different about something like a language or image because of the intersection of all the
different trajectories in this kind of way that isn't connected to a body one
body it's so like as you described your shirt that's that's a very interesting and of course it depends on all of our
as humans all of our trajectories of what how we've been taught what pink is as kids and like you can't separate it
from every moment of our life exactly where we live and so on and of course in
different geographical or emotional or conceptual spaces we'll have different
Clarifying the Question
understandings or experiences of of that shirt or a doll or whatever we want to talk about but I think we something happens in
society all the time I don't know if you agree that we assume that we're all experiencing that shirt your shirt is
now the object of of this conversation but we all experience that shirt and we think everyone's experiencing the same
way we are and so what I'm trying to do is like I don't feel like we pull it apart enough to understand that yes it's
connected to trajectories but not one trajectory and that all all the time
everything that we're encountering is being processed differently according to each space teral point so there's a sort
Neomaterialism and Interaction
of system three I like to think of it you know instead of fast and slow within the body it's more of a community you
know Daniel Conan kind of processing that's going on and I just I feel like we could put some focus on it like that
it could be helpful absolutely and and I think okay so let's talk about maybe a topic that's a little bit it shouldn't
be but it is controversial and explain how that factors into the question what
has the queer Community tried to do by calling themselves queer they've tried
to take a a a statistical pattern and sort of nudge it away from where people
want it so this isn't saying that there are statistical
patterns doesn't mean they're set in stone it just means when you take a population they're likely to be on some
distribution to think in a certain way but you can push the distribution somewhere else and that's why I like
this statistical manifold because it doesn't really first of all it doesn't
say that you and I will be on the same spot it says we are likely to be within a range most likely but we might be in
different points on the range and then it says well okay if this constitutes an attractor and I
know how much What factors contribute to it being an attractor here I can use
these same factors and push them over here and I think that's that's kind of brilliant and beautiful and empowering
Perception and Regularities
because now we know well we can just reappropriate a bunch of things I can decide that pink is not a feminine thing
in fact it's not it doesn't represent that at all now the problem is I don't control every Factor like I'm still
going to get perceived as a woman and so well by virtue of association with a woman okay but I can make or ask people
who engage with me if they are not in considering themselves women to wear pink and I enjoy that and it makes me
happy and if they want to contribute to that they can and lo and behold most of my boyfriends have worn pink like it's
it's no longer associated with femininity to them it's just associated with happy and joy and cool I was about
to say usually pretty cool guys wear pink these days but right exactly but it's that actually speaks to something
really fascinating too is that how these prior these um statistical regularities
can shift according to something like awareness it's another topic I wanted to ask you about a little bit is like do
you see a difference between this cognitive and the kind of conscious or
being or awareness or attention because you we you were talking about Buddhism and all of this and I think in some way
if you start in that tradition you're aware of everything as one and the whole and so on and there's some kind of way
in which the dichotomy side of things the the reductionist side of things is kind
of I don't know not as familiar and then you know vice versa if we want to give
these big kind of awful generalizations of different religions or parts of the country where you start with a more
reductionist and the idea of thinking of everything as whole is different because you're it's about the individual and and
all of this and it seems like the thing that changes that is what you're just describing with in terms
of the shift like we want to shift pink is going to be cool and you know who knows in 200 years maybe only guys wear
pink because it's shifted all the way to there but what does that is it something like awareness and I want to try to link
this you know to the active inference work but I wonder how you see that like Consciousness cognition intelligence are
those different where's the attention in that for you o
no I mean I in general Consciousness is broken down awareness is just one part
of it and I think that's probably correct in the sense that
sentence doesn't necessitate awareness per se I don't think I think you could
have well I mean awareness in the sense of an integrated perception a an
integrated qualitative perception is is more what I'm going to say yeah and I should have sorry I don't mean Consciousness the way it's always talked
about where it's like you're aware of yourself I really just mean the feeling of being alive or being alive being
itself and that can of course you know become being aware of your own self as a
self and all that yeah I mean so see this is interesting question because it gets to the core of what constitutes
Social Constructs and Identity
qualia right like is is qualia only this
right now what we think we're experiencing together or does it go much deep deeper in our your C to some
extent conscious and have some degree of qualia by virtue of being able to react
to to information in a way that like pushes entropy away because you know
lots of things react like potentially if you kick a rock it moves like it has you
it has had a reaction to what you did it's just not a reaction that effectively felt like an action it
didn't feel like it had control over where it intended to go next relative to
where it wants to go and there's a lot of words in there right like want to go like the the notion of wanting seems to
be Central to what we consider to be life or Consciousness so if if these are
more what we consider to be Consciousness along Mark somms maybe a lot of things might be more conscious
than we think and they may not require what we understand to be awareness but if we break down awareness to its more
most Central component I.E there is some information that is encoded and acted
upon or at least gained more Precision I feel
like that's that's closer to a pan psychist even conception of what
constitutes Consciousness it feels like something's missing though like if if
awareness is all that's required then what happens when you meditate and you become sort
of like flatly aware are you not conscious anymore is is there no
Precision here what what constitutes like the the very nature
of a color or something is it is it that you break reality apart somehow and you
encode it such that it has differentiability is does it is it is that required I don't really have the
answers to this question of course aiming in a Direction but obviously this isn't solved well so yeah I guess like
you said something earlier about it not being set in stone and I kind of think sometimes we do think of representations
Consciousness and Awareness
as set in stone like the color you know is is what it is or the math even when
we when we represent something we just assume it's static and in a way it is
static in this weird universe that we've built of language right it does move of
course language changes words change but it in that kind of if you just take a a very tiny slice of it it it seems static
relative to every everything else and I guess you know when you talk about qualia or something that's digging into
that a bit of I don't know that I really think there is qualia actually like I think what if we just go back down to
the very Basics and think of something we're always um measuring or assessing so this is a measurement or assess an
assessment already but we do that the body does that with itself right and that could be something like qualia or
that could even be something like thinking and that's kind of different than me verbalizing that in language but
the action itself feels to me the same kind of action of an agent moving
through its environment in in an active INF sort of way adjusting the
regularities you know all the stuff that active INF describes I don't see how that doesn't also apply to something
like me as an agent who now as language considering myself as an agent and
thinking of my own thoughts to me it seems like the same process I mean I agree effectively everything is recursive right like I know that Maxwell
really likes this idea of oh crap you know when you have these figures that are recursive I forget fractals or
fractals thank you I love fractals yeah so he's passionate about them and to him that's how you can perceive time and
reality and and space and I think I agree with this it's all quite recursive so the notion of saying words and
hearing them back if only for yourself but also from others and getting pinked back this is very fractal pattern where
we're going to get more more more precise so I think there's something to that nature and if we go back to your initial question which was how is
awareness and Consciousness factor in being able to shift societal patterns um
I think it gets to an interesting question of whether a group can be conscious as opposed to just individual
units within the group are conscious and then they produce patterns emerging patterns I think Mike Levan also gets to
these questions as to whether intelligence and therefore to some extent potentially sentence can happen
in the relationship between nodes and I agree with that that's what you said earlier right the commun intelligence have happens within communities even if
it's communities of cell that exchange information here I think that there's a possibility that what we're experiencing
is just not fully being at the level of the sentient layer that is above us
potentially but we are getting some messages from it some signals from it which constitutes culture and so what
we're doing at this level is telling it whoa this doesn't work for me oh my God
move move move and and when this pattern agglomerates enough when there's enough
of a signal it gets passed upward and potentially that's when it starts shifting like a nising model type thing
so I could totally see how by being the
only way for you to move things somewhere else is by being able to
measure what the thing is now right so yeah I do believe that in this sense there's a degree to which awareness
factors in our capacity to move things because I think awareness or Focus gives
you the the capacity to to add precision and determine how far away from your desired or preferred State you might
be Yeah you mentioned Michael lean and we could think of it as kind of as as
ways we're we're navigating like intelligence we could think of it
as the way that life or being or whatever we want to call it is making its way or navigating whatever the
encounter is that and it could be at different Landscapes it could be in the geographical world you know as an insect
doing whatever or a human it could be in conceptual space it could be in linguistic space morphogenic all these
spaces right that that we are setting as we're measuring and I guess something like that what you just described which
is a very important issue it's kind of in the human social space and that space
perhaps changes through communication or you know you talk about potentiations
and it's a change in potentiations I yes or potions am I saying it wrong the H the hsal idea of like potions
opportunity yeah right thanks so in a way when something changes in society
that's changed in the laws or something such as the way women are treated or what our rights are it what has changed
there is it that in this navigating space certain
spao temporal agents have expressed through these system three languages or
whatever what's happening and that it's wrong and somehow spread that through
through the groups that the group itself understands that it's wrong or I mean this is all very hard and awkward but I
just like you know how do we get an idea of what's what's happening there in terms of something like changing
minimizing surprise or changing the priors or so to me it's akin to
structure learning where you're essentially carving different ways that
you can have observations mapped to States or different ways that just States in
general are carved and then you do ban model selection where you determine that a model actually works better for you to
minimize free energy so I think that's that's what it is when you add a new state for instance like when you're when
you're saying there's a New Concept here you go um you're now proposing that there may be a better way to measure
reality and there com out of right like it's a script to you're changing the script so it's not that you just
proposed A New Concept it's that you've together shifted the scripts
regularities right it's embodied exactly it's embodied none of this is fully one or the other it's it's completely
connected and this gets back to the historicity right like I there has been historically groups that feel a lot of
error and eventually it gets to the point where they they have to act on it they have to do something about it and
because some slight subtle shifts happen in other places they get more and more
and more of an opportunity to have a policy that is going to actually phas shift them away from the the prior
situation they were in unfortunately those pH shifts are never as clear-cut as we would like them to be it seems
like anytime you really integrate A New Concept a new a new script let's say it does constitute a phase shift but there
are still things left over from the past so we can see it in the historicity of the US for instance right now now a lot
of people saying oh no no this thing is over it has been over for 200 years and the rest of the people are
like maybe some concept seems to have changed but there's still a lot of artifacts from the past that have
followed us regardless of this ability to break the representation in different ways so it's not I I don't think it's as
simple as we change the representation in the embodiment will change it's more like there's errors you change your
model of the world and thus will now have also probably to change your actions because with a new model it it
may be possible that the the the prior policies you were on no longer fit and so now you you have an uphill battle to
get the rest of the system to follow you to actually changing this policy so I
think I think this is what we can observe and it I think it gives a lot of credence to this idea that social groups
in general act like their own Mark of blanket like their own agents to some extent yeah sure it's again where you're
setting the scale of the mark of blanket but that's very fascinating to think about in terms of the role that
technology plays in that change so something like one of these movements
where people are treated wrong and and clearly you know seen in a way that's not accurate
and they have to change that by coming together and you know Shifting the regularities more or less often with
something like you know Force whether through language or image or whatever often technology plays a really big role
in that I mean because as you were talking we have to remember all that's Developmental and there's no Gap it's all coming from many trajectories
joining together and technology has been a way that people like the first images
of you know when people saw it then they knew it was real or something or radio TV now you know we can go all the way
through the internet into something like AI so two things as we kind of wind down is
I wonder how you see the role of of technology in this and you know it does relate back to your own work and where you started and where you are now you're
Now using technology in a way to maybe help open up some of this community
change space or I don't know maybe that's too idealistic but I would just wonder what you think about that and
yeah I'll just leave it there for now but so this is a sort of grandio idea
but if we understand Consciousness as the capacity to integrate information
such that it is encoded on a form of boundary and that boundary is sort of aimed at potentially maintaining the
agent that has the boundary and you consider AI to be anchored
within a system I think what it says is that
there's a possibility to make more Manifest this integration of information
through what AI can do which is basically integrate information and synthesizes to do
something useful which is what cognition does right that's what we do we're trying to get to that unfortunately
currently we're getting to a point where we can only integrate certain kinds of information and when we do integrate it
it can only do a certain kind of thing like it doesn't do everything it does one thing very well or it does another
thing very well but not both at once and it can't generalize from one to the other we're trying to get towards that
that was what people thought they saw in Chad gbt they thought they saw generalist turns out it's not exactly a generalist it's more like a really
really really really good language machine that because language is structured and generally what you feed
into it is structured patterns of language you don't just feed garbage it tends to have encapsulated some of these
regularities but it hasn't encapsulated the the understanding the causal re the
causal um layer that allows you to understand that because thing is this way another thing is this way that's not
quite what Chad has or G in general none of the others do either llms in general
we are getting toward a point where we might but the point is it may become this sort of you could say conscious you may not
want to say conscious you could say overarching layer that integrates information and it that's kind of
beautiful but at the same time a little scary because I think I
know who I am I think I know what groups generally think I belong to them I don't
know what boundaries are encapsulated within the system system that is bounded
by a given AI system so when you when you when you're sick when something goes
wrong with your body your body fights it it tries to get rid of it because obviously right you want to maintain
your regularities I think everybody is sort of seeing AI in this way and see and
that's why you saw the emergence of grock which was a non-woke AI because
people were like well I want to be the thing which is represented in that boundary I don't want something else to
be represented people are very afraid of biases in AI because they're like well if AI is going to be this integration
layer and it thinks something is good and I don't constitute what is good it's going to discriminate against me and
we've seen that we've seen AI discriminating against subcommunities because the historical data chosen had
Technology and Social Change
this pattern of discrimination that identified these groups as groups that were not part of what is represented in
the AI so that's I think that's clear sometimes that the llms at least are trained on data and it's just like we
were talking about with a life you know as as we develop we're sort of everyone says stuff to us and they tell us pink
is for girls so that's what we spit out unless we see another option or someone
you know breaks that open and but with the llm it can't learn anymore so it's just whatever you've put into it it's
just going to stick on that so well I mean there are our lhf patterns so you
know we could the problem is we haven't figured out how to do it well so the continual learning is not exactly
continual and even that's kind of what active inference AI is sort of trying to do right right so that's the thing so a
active inference is supposed to be non-static by by very nature and so you
you would constantly have a system that adapts to its surroundings but I think this notion of a biased AI needs to be a
little bit flipped on its head maybe what we don't need is an unbiased AI maybe what we need is a lot of very
locally biased AI that just focus on this perspective that understands it has
a perspective and is crouched in that such that we would know what to use at a
given time that's a wonderful idea and so dangerous and so wonderful because it really matters then that everyone
understands that they're biased that the AI is biased so that's again that awareness thing of how do we because
that that's actually really smart what you said I mean that that could work if
everyone understood that it's biased it's kind of like with the social media where we people don't understand that they're in a feed that's giving them an
orientation of the world but if we understood that we could even play with it and look at all the orientation so there's always a scaling too of
awareness I guess to go back to that no absolutely I think it is I think the key
question is who gets to define the bias that we're going to adopt for a given situation and that's not a solved
question that that's where we get into ethics and again I think technology is starting to wake up to the fact that
they need ethics in order to do anything because their power can no longer go
unchecked like lots of companies have ethics boards now so these tools are coming I hope they come fast enough yeah
and there's a transparency in active inference AI at least that's try they're trying to build that in you're you know so it's people are aware of it it
reminds me of like the priests who used to only be the ones to read so they could sort of dictate what the Bible said and then everyone learned to read
and it sort of changed I mean maybe we're there with AI in a weird way and who knows but you know just to to kind
of end it and come back to your own you know we started with with your your story and I wonder those problems that
you started with and ideas and questions have you found you know in learning to code and going through all this really
hard work I mean this is not easy to digest all the information you digest and like what how has that changed your
own trajectories and paths kind of in the scope of what we've been talking about or has it I don't
know this so initially I started with a very deep love for postmodernism and
then I had to exist in different circles that were very much not postmodernists
and it it changes your perspective on things it makes you qualify things differently and now I'm sort of going
back over the pendulum where I'm like this qualification of these things I used to like had a purpose they were
trying to do something which was push back on the possibility of critique and push back on the possibility of control
of what they're doing because they want to maintain a certain order of things and so now I'm sort of going back over
these things and and having perhaps more nuanced perspective over um my previous leanings but I'm still finding that
these tools are useful like fuku constructivism these are very very
useful Frameworks to understand what's going on and how we might be able to counter it such as educate everybody
just give everybody the tools to understand what's going on and use them as well don't just let it be in the
hands of a very select few who then get to decide without your input and therefore maybe you'll be on the lucky
side but maybe you won't be does that have to do with self-esteem too another another topic that you've written about
does that does does all that stuff you just said having that and bringing that back in do something for the phenomenology of the spacio temporal
sort of awareness within the mark of blanket in terms of empowering or giving some yeah I think think I
think self-esteem is is just a tool a tool that enables you to either try to
fit within the group if you find benefit to it or flip against the group if you
find that this isn't working for you and there are obviously psychological
factors that either keep you within a low self-esteem or allow you to try to flip such that you can now grow your
self-esteem relative to another group I think that's why it's important for certain movements to to say x is
beautiful because it doesn't matter whether they believe it or not doesn't matter whether others believe it or not
what it is is a social tool to help them grow their self-esteem to create enough momentum that they can now be
represented in something where their interests and beliefs are Forefront all right that's good there'd
be more questions but uh it's over the hour is over for now and that was that was a fun ride so thanks so much I
really appreciate your perspective and the work you're doing well thank you for reading it chatting with me it was great
