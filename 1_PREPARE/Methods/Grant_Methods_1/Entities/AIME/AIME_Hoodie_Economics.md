HOODIE ECONOMICS
Economics measures what we value, and in that way,
economics is for everyone. But modern financial empires
have shut out the many to instead prioritise ‘limitless’ market
growth, attention economies and stock profits for the very
few. We have been denied our sense of agency and taught to
focus on the self above all, and the biggest stock that is down
is our relationships – both with each other and with nature.
But we have the powerful tools of imagination and exchange
that will allow us to reshape economics for everyone.
In Hoodie Economics, Jack Manning Bancroft offers urgent
and transformative solutions to embrace Indigenous thinking
and ideas from outside the margins – shifting the focus
from the people in suits to the people in hoodies. He draws
on alternative intelligence sources to look at the patterns
of money, ownership and reductive thinking that we have
inherited, and how we have the potential to create a new
(old) foundation of equality – relational economies instead
of transactional ones, and networks that are truly social.
In increasingly anxious and tumultuous times, this book
offers an energising and mind-expanding economic
philosophy that centres unlikely connections, knowledge
sharing, custodianship and joy.Jack Manning Bancroft is the founder and CEO of AIME. He is
a graduate of the University of Sydney and Stanford University,
a former NSW Young Australian of the Year, and an author of
books for children and adults. Jack has received a Human Rights
Medal, an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Western
Sydney and is the youngest person in Australian history to be
awarded an Honorary Doctorate, which he received from the

A PLATYPUS
Yo, so I’m related to Jack through the Bundjalung Nation, I’m Jack’s
totem, Djanbun they call me. In many ways I wasn’t meant to be as
a species. I won’t share all of my creation stories, but I will tell you
that the essence of one of them is that I was born from wrong way.
I wasn’t meant to be, two species coming together, a water rat
and a duck. Through horror, I was born, and I had no place in the
world, but here I arrived, a mutation, a patchwork, a frankenstein.
I’m egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed. I got a bill,
I forage, I disrupt in billabongs, I got fur and a venomous spur – it
will not kill you, but it will hurt you for a while before you heal.
My being is complex. Yours too.
When I look at you people and your economies, your ways
now, I see some inherited horror, I see many wrong ways, but
I know as an outcast, a mashup, a misfit, that there is rich
intelligence activated if we shift our lens from where we map
from, and the tools we build with. I know that through horror we
can find health.

Hoodie EconomicsNote From A Plat ypus
There is complexity in this book, as the world is complex. This
book may be a challenge sometimes – part art, part poetry, part
memoir, part philosophy, part economic theory, part history, part
imagined, a lot real. To a patterned human lens it may require
intellectual or spiritual work, and many elements may not make
sense initially, but look through the platypus lens and they may.
This book shares Indigenous systems thinking and intelligence
from outside the margins, which have been gifted to Jack through
his bloodlines and lived experience. It has come through relations
with many different thinkers and beings who have been pushed
systemically to the perimeters. Their knowledge has helped inform
this text, and the critical lesson is in the processes.
This book is about practical behavioural economics with the
prize of valuing the heart of humanity, your relations to each
other, to nature, and to time before us and time afterwards. Your
opportunity as a species is to see and hear the processes that
should shape the next century and beyond, the return to your
custodial nature.
It’s your time to mutate – to mutate what you value and mutate
who defines value.
You may find the tangents in the book distracting from the
point, or what you think is the point, but sometimes that is
the point; the threads are unwieldy, the distraction shows up the
pretence of one single truth. I think that might be me and my
friends from nature singing through the writing. The rivers I run in
are rich currents, some we see, many we don’t. Current-see and
don’t see. Value in all of it. One body of water.
This book isn’t about specific lore from the Bundjalung Nation,
the place where Jack and I are related. It is informed by Indigenoussystems thinking in Australia, and then opens up as we access
knowledge from everywhere – from Narnia to Wind in the Willows,
to Pan, to Atreyu, to Captain Planet, to Jack’s own imagination,
and then to roots, to the lessons of nature, rounding us back to the
processes of Indigenous systems patterns, not just from here but
from around the world.
Like when I churn up the water, I do it furiously, so Jack
furiously churns up the water in this book. A mashup of unlikely
connections can re-wire and re-generate. Look to the patterns,
the patterns and processes we all have on Planet Earth, and what
translation you have lost from me and my friends, from our natural
libraries, and what you might find through this churn.
It seems this book is about humanity, beyond race, beyond
borders, in places of movement where beings are simply free, in
your imagination and your complexity. The potential is already
here. The knowledge is here. You must remember, before it’s too
late, your role as a species is to be custodians of the Earth.
I communicate through the electroreceptors in my bill, I have
electric vibrations to find my way to food, and when Jack speaks of
relations I think of the vibrations that you don’t measure. You get
electricity and put it into a box, but do you measure the electricity
in your relations? Your human-to-human energy? Your human-
to-nature energy? Where is the value placed? Where does your
attention go?
The answers are in the maps, and when and where we place
the maps.
Unlikely connections, mutation – this is natural, and it’s shared
through me, through and from many species, through many
times and places, and now shared with you. Together we keep
3Hoodie Economics
threading the continuous yarn of life, everything in relation to
everything, weaving through in the space between, that’s how we
make meaning.
I’m off to churn the water, I’ll be thinking of you, and singing
through you with long knowledge. Enjoy your own churn, it’s good
for the water’s health.
4PROCESSES OF
EMERGENCE
This book has been written from and in a place of deep
emergence. Often I’ve felt like I’m not writing it, like I’m just
channelling this knowledge, a momentary knowledge holder,
passing it through to the world. At other times I feel like I’m just
being a decent journo, plying my trade, capturing the biggest
picture, the big story, and unpacking it.
The painting for this chapter feels to me like stars moving
through the universe, which in essence captures our journey on
Earth – a star explodes and then in the end into a star we will go.
This painting captures that essence of life cycles, of big colour star
explosions, and of the life and intelligence that breaks through and
keeps on emerging.

Hoodie EconomicsProcesses of Emergence
My process in this book was to be open and share the sparks
of the text early so it could catch alight with collective energy and
insight; for example from the moment that the first draft was down
our whole team at AIME, the mentoring network for marginalised
youth I founded in the 2000s, has been in the manuscript reading
away, sharing notes and ideas. I’ve shared the draft with friends,
family, my partner, and with strangers and people new to AIME; the
process of having so many eyes across it has allowed the text to
keep emerging.
Sandy Grant, the CEO of the group publishing this book, was
deeply encouraging of this pursuit from the germination of the
idea. I wrote to Sandy when the pandemic started to emerge
and told him I felt I had a book in me around economics. He
encouraged me to write. I felt like I’d felt a few years earlier when
I went and saw Hamilton in New York – and left at intermission.
Man that show is alive; as a relational gift, it fuelled me.
There is a scene just towards the end of the first act, where they
are speaking about writing the constitution, and Hamilton says
something to the effect that if we want to change the government,
we have to write the rules, write the laws, write. The narrator then
shares how many articles the people on stage had published in the
process of building the modern nation state of the United States
of America. As they counted off the number of articles each had
written, culminating in the dozens and dozens by Hamilton, my
whole body was electrified. I had to write. I had to write more.
To think more. Write Jack, go write.
So I left at intermission. I don’t know many people that walked
out of Hamilton at intermission, and I wasn’t leaving because I was
upset, I left because my inspiration bucket was full – I had to go,
I had to write, to flow.I jumped on the N train back to our home in Queens, and
immediately wrote an article for The New York Times. It was never
published. Doesn’t matter. The thinking wasn’t ready yet. There
were other things I had to do: I went off and invented a university,
became a puppeteer, designed a country, became a visual artist
and let a couple of hundred paintings pour out of me. I drew, and
read, and thought, and then it started to emerge.
A few years on, after staring at blank pages following Sandy’s
invitation to explore a book, here we are. The book arrived here via
knowledge formed through relations.
One of the key relations for me in the last few years has been
Tyson Yunkaporta. In shaping this book, Tyson shared so much.
He is a systems thinker and has given me great energy, the
freedom to fly and be, intelligence in the build, and then he gifted
me a huge process idea – painting the chapters. In his 2019 book
Sand Talk, Tyson carved the chapters into wood, into knowledge
holders. He said the process of getting off the page and into
relation with his hands and body helped illuminate the thinking.
Same here. I paint under the name of BRAT, which takes me to
a place where I don’t have to explain myself, where the energy
can flow, and what is is what is. Tyson once said, ‘You paint like
a lunatic, you should paint the chapters.’ And so they emerged.
Between Tyson and Johny Mair, the co-founder of Ethic,
a fin-tech company that enables ethical investment, I feel like
I’ve found peers in and around my generation – it’s been nice to
find a couple of misfits to cause good trouble with. I’m thankful
for Johny’s mind, soul, friendship and ability to walk the talk –
and I’m stoked that our relations are now in the world through
three of the paintings in this book, two done in Ethic’s office
in Tribeca, NY, and another in the apartment of Johny and his

wonderful wife Negar in East Williamsburg (with the rest done in
my BRAT studio in Bellambi, a suburb of Wollongong).
As you head into the book, guided by these paintings, I wish you
joy. And before you take off, share with me this moment of love.
Thanks to my family, my mum for always, and I mean always,
seeing the biggest possible world view, and with her open mind
and heart cherishing and nurturing my imaginings with such
tenderness and love: Mum, I wouldn’t have done any of this
without you. You made me feel like I wasn’t crazy, you gave me
hope, joy, and have gifted our whole family a strong muscle of
inherited imagination.
To my partner Yael Stone, oh my goodness, our family relations
are everything; you’re the core of my life, the hope coals and
fire. I know I threw us off a cliff seven years ago, and it’s been
exhilarating, scary, inspiring, sad, joyful, and through it all, you gave
me an anchor that is more powerful than anything on Earth, you
loved me for me, not for what I did. You’ve loved little Jack too, and
in doing so helped me free grown-up Jack to get back to the little
guy who likes to play, who likes to be the disruptive platypus, the
naughty kid, the BRAT, for good, for fun, for life.
To the AIME team, from forever, to all the mentees and
mentors, to all the generous thinkers who have danced with me,
who have been patient with my probing, generous in exploring
different ways, open to possibility, thank you for the process of
collective emergence.
To my dad and his wife Maz, my sisters and brother, thanks for
standing by me, walking with me. You are all such a gift.
To the Stone family, thank you for accepting, with the deepest
open love, another oddball into your clan.To my mates, thank you for being goofballs with me and giving
space for play and absurdity. Thanks for holding me, crying with
me, and leaving space for me to grow up, whatever that is. To
Kabir, for editing this piece along the way and working with me on
ideas since we met at university.
To Mick and Emily for their craft, patience and talent in editing
this book, and Sandy and the team at Hardie Grant for not boxing
me in.
And then finally to little Pemau and Marli, this is for you
kids, and for all kids, for all of us. I love life, I love humans, I love
Earth, and I love you two as much as the whole universe. You’ve
reminded me that beyond all this work, all these relations, all this
effort, all this striving, all this movement, we are simply beings of
life, and then we pass it on. Thanks for making the complex simple.
You remind me, you two and Yael and our puppy Uppo, that I’ve
got everything I ever need right here, I’m more than enough, I want
for nothing and I just want to spend the rest of my life with you.
With that, friends, the show is about to begin, turn your phones
off, and let’s get this party started.
11AN INVITATION
Economics is for everyone.
Economics is another way of seeing and understanding life, like
any other belief or way.
Economics defines what we value. But we define economics.
Every moment, every human contributes to the global economy
with energy, joy, life, effort, pain, struggle, violence, anger,
disruption, disagreement, hope, dissolution, peace, negotiations,
sleeping, waking, eating, drinking, laughing, crying, loving, living,
dying. Our lives are filled with choices that reflect our values.
Our behaviours are open to manipulation by healthy and
unhealthy actors, but deep down in our minds we have a
supercomputer that can set us free: our imagination. We can use
our imagination to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery, as
the great Bob Marley once urged.
Many of us are lucky to have more agency than what we
imagine. The travesty is to become so distracted that we lose our
most simple fulfilling gift.

Hoodie EconomicsAn Invitation
Our lives are not on loan from some god; we do not start in
debt, we start with abundance. You do not have to spend a life
following an inherited pattern of despair. You don’t owe anyone
anything. You are complete. You are a being.
We inherit an Earth where everything has always been here
and everything will be here after we are gone. We are enough.
We don’t need more. We have all the knowledge we need in front
of us, stored in the intelligence of nature. We have millennia of
documented intelligence and we have each other.
Life is relations, between ourselves and the world around
us, between now and before, between now and after. Life is a
continuum of energy, and we are lucky enough to have a fleeting
zap of it power our fragile bodies for a moment before the energy
current moves on. What we do, who we are, counts. It adds up to
the energy flow of life.
That flow of life is then taken score of by economists who say
‘human nature is x’ and ‘human nature is y’, ‘the stocks are up’,
‘the stocks are down’.
We are naturally in relations, but our modern systems and
networks are not.
The biggest stock that is down is the strength of our relations.
Our relations to each other and to nature. To those outside the
margins of our lives. To the future of Planet Earth. To the past and
everything that has come before, right back to the dinosaurs and
the explosion of stardust that led to the creation of this marvel of
a spinning blue dot we call home.
Economics shouldn’t be hidden from plain sight: we are the
economists, we define what we value by the choices we make,
we just haven’t developed a measurement of our time that can
value nature, life, relations, joy, health and kindness. But we can.One of the strongest human relational systems I have seen –
and that I’m lucky to be a part of – is the relational system of
Indigenous Australians. To those who like to keep score, we’ve
got 60,000+ years of continuous intelligence lived and passed
on, in relation to human beings, the trees, the animals, the rivers,
the sky. Find me another think tank in the world with that on
their CV.
I believe we need to work towards a relational economy that
brings Indigenous systems thinking – and other intelligence
from outside the margins – to the front of our systems designs,
to the front of our financial tools, to the front of our robotics,
to the front of our ethics and morality. Because when we find
ourselves in relation with nature, when we find the value of life
being everything – not just human life but all life – then we start to
design systems that are healthy for all Earth’s inhabitants.
When I say Indigenous systems thinking, I’m referring to the
patterned knowledge, the ways of living, knowing, sharing and
relating, that have sustained human life for so long, not just on
the continent of Australia. The Indigenous systems at large are in
relation with nature, with each other, with the time stick passed
backwards and forwards – 500 years before and after. Actual
practice varies and varied from place to place, but Indigenous
systems thinking is fundamentally centred around relations.
In 2017 when New Zealand gave legal rights to the Whanganui
River, we saw the glimpse of a relational economy emerging.
We saw a bit more two years later when Bangladesh gave all its
rivers legal rights.
When I talk of Indigenous systems thinking I do it with a long
future in mind. From New York to Belgrade, from Brisbane to
Nairobi – if we do it rite way, we all become the contemporary
15Hoodie Economics
custodians of this next chapter in human history, for the next
2000 or even 20,000 years.
Today, the world in which we live is missing the relational economy
my ancestors richly designed – which has echoes and mirrors
across the Earth’s surface pre the formation of the modern state
and colonial empires. That colonial wave of empire design was
deeply intentional. It systematically designed relational patterns
to make us feel like we are not enough, to remove our capacity to
see our basic human decency, our capacity for joy and kindness,
and replaced it with pettiness, anxiety, fear, anger. We’ve inherited
networks that were shaped to channel natural resources and
labour for colonial empires. These networks were not built for all.
They were built for a few to gain more than their share, where the
coin became the modality to track debt, to move wealth back and
forth between kings and queens.
Mass media and social networking waves of empire design
and control have only amplified our lack of worth. Few have
worked out how to mobilise story to influence governments better
than Rupert Murdoch, who has played his part in the dissolution
of the fourth estate, and filled the void with heretics, sex, violence,
money, and a rodeo of clowns that even have the bulls in Spain
confused which way to run.
Others who worked out how to pull off the trick of mobilising
story created social networks – which further weakened the fourth
estate by siphoning off its advertising dollars. Rupert’s newspapers
had two to four pages of celebrities on the ‘social’ pages – social
media expanded those pages to infinity and cut out all the rest,

An Invitation
all the journalism. And soon these new networks evolved into the
most influential modern communication tools. Suddenly they were
shaping elections at the macro level, and dumbing down human
beings at the micro level. These systems remove complexity and
feed us all with what we know and who we know. Confirmation
bias compounded endlessly. Making more and more camps of
isolated human beings.
Search functions have channelled the endless possibilities
of the internet into more and more curated delivery, with
advertisements at the top of each page, intentionally leaving
the door open for businesses to steal every piece of information
they can about us. The computer was linked to the internet, then
the computer was shoved into a phone that was shoved into our
pockets, encouraging human beings to touch it a thousand times
a day.
Amid a suite of hugely revolutionary design frames that have
enhanced the dream of the internet and technology to bring us
together, to share knowledge widely and freely, these modern
‘heroes’ have shaped a huge demonic force that has us in its claw
grip. We’ve given up our information, our memories, our knowledge,
our relations, our desires, our eye movement, our private
conversations (thanks Siri or hey Google or whoever is listening).
All of these platforms are traps, devouring our attention, distracting
us from living, and then using our attention to sell ads back to us.
The ‘attention economy’ destroys attention – everything is
dumbed down to a slogan. Our leaders talk in slogans – ‘axe the
tax’, ‘make this great’. The ‘attention economy’ also destroys
the economy of relations between people, by atomising us all.
Attention spans don’t just drop after millennia of evolution. We are
distracted – by that screen in front of us. Do we want within one
1718
Hoodie EconomicsAn Invitation
generation to enter a distracted void where we forget everything
humankind has learned, developed, grown, gifted? Are we going
to have our heads down in our laps, tapping away the evolution of
our species?
We are distractible beings and we are relational beings. In the
battle of distraction versus relation, I’m keen to balance the ledger
back in favour of the deep genetic relational intelligence inside of
us, and to remind us of the promise and potential of the internet
for equality and justice, for rewiring the network to reverse the
inherited patterns of the empires.
As to those who have peacefully passed on knowledge with
discipline and joy and kindness, the connection and wonder
between humanity, the mentors, the Elders, the guides, the
dinosaurs, the stardust that made us – what would we say to them
as we try to explain what we’ve done with the Earth in just a few
hundred years? What will we say to our children? What will history
make of our self-destruction?
As we have broken, we can remake.
As the tik is tokking and we are now carving out the seconds,
I feel the urgency to fight back and make space for us all, to
remind us not to be distracted, to remind us we are all economists,
defining value.
In the battle of seconds, I don’t wanna waste a minute to help
us free up the hours and days and weeks to have space for our
imagination, relations and intelligence to emerge and flow.
This next decade is as important a period in modern history as
we’ve faced. We’ve gotta change our behaviours yesterday, get
into relation with each other and nature, shift what we value, and
design a pattern of economic behaviour that can sustain human
life on Earth with the abundance of what is afforded to us.Planet Earth will survive climate change – it has another seven
and a half billion years to cruise around the solar system and an
infinite galaxy wonderland before the Sun eats it – but human life
and human intelligence on Earth are under threat, as are so many
of our wonderful animal and plant friends.
The enemy is distraction, by design, to continue to network
power into the hands of few. The enemy is systems that lead us to
making decisions driven by our coins and short returns.
The solution is understanding that we have power. We can
choose behaviours, we can reshape patterns, we can imagine
new realities. We can change the network, because we are
the network.
And I know because I’ve done it in a small-big way. Nineteen
years ago, while at university, I designed AIME, a network to
hack inequity that started in Sydney, Australia, and operates now
across the world. It was and is an attempt to restore relations
by creating unlikely connections in a new network, an anti-
networking model of human connections – anti-networking in
the sense that it expands you beyond your network, plugs you in
elsewhere, connecting those inside the margins with those outside
the margins to build a fairer world. I am now in the process of
building that physical network into an alternative digital network,
a relational network not a social network, a new digital country
in the internet, IMAGI-NATION, which I’ll speak to throughout
this book. Connecting you to who you don’t know and what you
don’t know, not to who and what you know. Not to mine your mind
and soul and sell that information to others to make you feel less
worthy so you buy something more you don’t need, but to free and
fuel your mind with imagination, to light up your energy with hope.
And create action that changes the world for the better.

Hoodie EconomicsAn Invitation
Our economy, in the world of AIME, is a relational economy. It’s
based on healthy Indigenous patterns of relations, where you give
and don’t expect anything in return and know it’s not a waste of
time. It’s give-give. We trade as needed, we share our knowledge
freely and widely, and in deepening our exchanges, we build an
ongoing mentoring continuum of human progress.
At the centre of our economy isn’t a coin, it’s a hoodie.
A sweatshirt, a common thread.
For anyone thinking a hoodie can’t be a coin – well, in the past
we have used oxen, cowry shells, salt bars, to name just a few.
Or maybe we could make up a bunch of numbers and link them to
a piece of plastic and another set of numbers and beep and bop
and take and give and move the trade with never-ending numbers
in a place called online.
Hoodie it is then.
The hoodie is a symbol of rebellion, for the outsider and
outcast, and with this hoodie we are throwing our hand out to
those who wear hoodies and those who don’t, to those who think
about economics and those who don’t, and to those who didn’t
realise that we are all economists – deciding value, understanding
history and future, dancing through temporal shape-shifting to
make decisions day in, day out that are economic decisions, moral
decisions, decisions about life.
I see life as a story, as a remarkable experiment, as a true
wonder, a show where we are the playwrights and scriptwriters,
the actors, the directors, the cast and crew. For many of us,
economics is very dense theatre written in its own iambic
pentameter with zero intent to engage the audience. But I’m keen
to improvise with what we’ve got and cook up a story, weave a
yarn of narrative into a show that we can all be a part of.Stan Grant, a brilliant journalist who comes from Wiradjuri, a
nearby Country to my home Country, Bundjalung, once said on a TV
show I was hosting that ‘Our entire world is an idea. What we see
as the modern world is something that we have invented, we have
thought up. These things that we take for granted. What is a nation?
What is a democracy? What is a border? What is an economy?
These things are things we have imagined into being.’ Imagination
is our playground. It’s the starting point and it’s the place and
space where I try to spend much of my life. As Albert Einstein once
told a journalist: ‘Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.’
I write this book now not to add to the endless libraries of
theorising what created the challenges we have inherited, or
to illuminate the flaws in our system and leave it at that. I offer
solutions, to showcase a study of a relational economy, to inform
systems with Indigenous systems thinking and relational patterns,
to bring into the centre of the design process the intelligence from
outside the margins.
I don’t believe the drive for equality defeats inequity, because
the thinking is oppositional – Indigenous and non-Indigenous,
white and black. The frame divides, and when it is applied
systemically at best equality gets us to fifty per cent. I think the
solution to alleviate inequity is to search for intelligence, and the
largest source of intelligence (which includes the intelligence of
nature) is outside the margins. When we focus on intelligence
rather than equality as a design frame, we are entering the
doorway to the house of abundance.

Hoodie EconomicsAn Invitation
Here’s my invitation to you. In this book, I’ll walk you through
a real-life case study that I’ve lived through, of building and then
designing and expanding a relational economy. I’ll share with
you the flaws I see inherited from our current networks, and the
potential we hold. I’ll then take the time to share with you how
the heck we got about building a digital country and the real-life
economic and design challenges we faced and worked through,
and the solutions we found along the way. And then finally, I’m
gonna talk about death – how I see death as life, as our greatest
design gift, how all organisations should have a designed death
date for the health of our collective human journey, how death
focuses us on passing it on, all of it. You’ve got to give it away to
keep it.
This book is for every single human being, because every
one of us is in relation and economics is the playground for all of
us. This book is a bridge – between the established economists
who have recorded their thinking in books and diagrams, and
the not-yet-recognised economists outside the margins, whose
systems and intelligence desperately need to be connected into our
systems at large.
The goal is to bring relations to the front of the queue, to invest
in our relations beyond our immediate circle, to bring into focus
process rather than outcomes as the systemic design frame,
allowing us to keep our greatest mental tool – our imagination –
activated and healthy, and to enable us to build healthier, stronger
relations between human beings, and between human beings and
nature. The pathways were already laid yesterday, we just gotta
lift them from the past, into our modern design systems. If we can
stop diminishing our fields of enquiry, closing down imagination,
dismissing diverse expressions of intelligence, if we can insteadfind common ground on bridges of unlikely connections, then in
that fertile goop we can create relational webs of meaning that will
transform our relationship with the planet. Investing in relational
networks – not social networks – can change the way the world
works, help incubate the necessary imaginative thinking required
to solve challenges like climate change, and fundamentally make
caring about ourselves, each other and the world the first priority in
our lives.
I’ve written this book with the highest possible expectations
for you and our fellow human beings. I believe in our decency
and untapped potential, our limitless imagination, our thirst for
something deeper. I write this in the certain knowledge that, deep
down, we all hunger for joy. I do this work desiring nothing in
return, while still knowing it’s not a waste of time – and that, my
unlikely friend, is where the path to joy begins.
The painting at the start of this chapter gives you a sense of the
movement that will ensue in Hoodie Economics: it will tilt us, like the
Earth is tilted, it will jump us across train tracks as we look to move
from the networks we have inherited to the networks we can build,
and it’s a rainbow, a connection between us all and our imagined
states and life beyond the rainbow. The symbols throughout the
paintings are like the Easter eggs throughout these pages – some
elements will be just for you, others will, like the rainbow, be seen by
all who look for it.
Before I let you go jump out of whatever reality you are in
and join me in this time-space-leap vortex of wanderings, a few
people when reading the draft of this book shared kindly that

I’ve done my best to draw out a map on the next spread, and
throughout the book have provided little symbols for when you
might feel like taking a breath, or a break, digesting a biscuit or
changing the economic system. Of course I encourage you to
disregard the map and any moments I offer for structured breaks
or tangential balloon-watching moments, but this map will give
you a non-linear space to move in if you don’t feel like following
the logic thread or path laid out by a table of contents. I’m thankful
for artist LUNA TUNES for helping bring the map I sketched (and
other drawings in this book) to life.
And with that, let us conclude the introductions and safety

24SMALL Big TALK
I don’t like small talk. Small talk makes for small thinking. Small
thinking makes for repetition.
Small ideas that grow? Big talk, big action? Hey, you got me.
If we were standing at a party and I blinked and you began
explaining how the motion of the blinking of eyelids defies the laws
of thermodynamics, and you then explained that if we could work
out how to make a gel with the same viscosity of the gel on our
eyes then we could potentially create one of the more efficient
natural designs of battery-powered mechanics on Earth, I’m
leaning in. Maybe you’d go on to explain that was just a thought
experiment, but that it had recently been discovered that geckos’
footpads when climbing walls can lead friction to increase rather
than decrease, which is what holds under the classic laws of
physics – again, I’m leaning in.
Or we start small, we experiment, with an eye on going big.
Small big talk, yeah that’s a vibe.

I like experiments. I like unpredictability. I feel like I’ve been in
a social experiment since birth, in fact aren’t we all? A baby grows
inside a mother’s uterus – that’s about the most mind-boggling
thing I’ve ever heard of. I don’t wanna waste my gift of life. My gift
of a mind. My ability to learn.
When I painted this chapter, it just burst out, exploding like a
mind that’s finding something new, ripping open with the pent-up
potential that is wasted in so many moments of small talk. In the
background there’s the endless colour and movement waiting
to be revealed in all of our individual and collective depth if we
can imagine and move beyond our small-talk states. If we can
dance in the realm of ideas, pick up the pen and write the next
chapters ourselves.
A friend of mine, journalist Jeff McMullen, once passed on to
me a nugget of wisdom that Ray Charles had shared with him.
I visualise this moment of Jeff and Ray, in the back of some jazz
bar, the club getting set up for the gig, the cameras rolling, andbrother Ray smiles, looks up to the corner of the ceiling and says
to Jeff, ‘None of us own the notes, some of us are lucky enough to
hold onto them for a little while before we pass them on.’
While I get my tiny window holding a note or two as this rock
called Earth spins at a thousand miles an hour, tilting on an axis,
while we are all conscious and bent and spinning, and gravity does
it’s thing grounding us, and plants suck in carbon and spit out
oxygen, you better believe I ain’t wasting a minute on small talk.
But perhaps before we talk about small talk, I have to tell you
about me.
At seventeen, I had plans on chasing a career as a professional
cricketer and then being a sports journalist. It’s hard to unravel
patterns. Every hero I’d had as a little boy was male and an
athlete, they were the gods of our country, and so when I dreamt,
I thought, sport = best I could be.
Enter an unlikely connection to throw me off my course. To
get my ticket into university I’d interviewed for a scholarship.
They were looking for an Aboriginal pseudo-Rhodes Scholar, the
model was an all-round leadership position, the scholarship was
sponsored by a bank. And the scholar would reside at St Paul’s
College, Australia’s oldest residential college, at Australia’s oldest
university, the University of Sydney. To say it’s an old boys club
would be an understatement. I was potentially walking into the
very heart of the network that had patterned Australia to exclude,
that had inherited wealth from how we are networked, and I was
going to sit in dining rooms with people who stood and sang ‘God
Save the Queen’, and be the first Indigenous student there – and
try to find a way to move us forward.
So let’s jump into the scene when it all went from possibility
to reality.

Sydney, December 2002. I’m walking up a spiral staircase at
the university, and it feels like there is mould everywhere. We get
to a board room (bored room?). Sitting around the table is the CEO
of a big bank, a future governor-general, the boss of the university,
a member of the university council, fancy, serious, pretty old folk,
and someone says, ‘Why we give this to you?’
I think, Is that Yoda speak? I say, ‘If you give it to me, I’m going
to want to put something back, and if I do anything in my life, I’ll do
something big.’
Cricket and sports journalism ended then and there. My eyes
were open, I had to look at the world through a big lens if I was
gonna try to change it.
Sitting at the back of my lecture theatre in first year studying
journalism I got to meet Kabir Dhanji, who ended up becoming a
lifelong friend. He came up and asked, ‘Is this seat taken?’
I said yes, he shook his head and walked away.
I had my own story going on. I felt that I was dumb, that I didn’t
belong. A fraud who got a scholarship. Numbers had shaken me,
I got 87.6 in my final year of school – that was my worth. The
course was filled with people who got 99.3 and above. When Kabir
walked up and wanted to sit next to me, I didn’t let him because
I was afraid that the first question would be, ‘What score did you
get?’ That is, ‘What are you worth?’
Not long after my rejection of Kabir, we found ourselves in
partnership in a film tutorial group, then a friendship blossomed.
Kabs is Kenyan, and was living on campus at one of the other
colleges. We quickly found our outcast groove as we skipped
out of our formal dinners on campus each night and wandered
the streets of inner Sydney talking about the world and how to
change it.One of the subjects we kept circling was schooling. NASA
recently completed a study that showed over ninety-five per
cent of five-year-olds have a genius-level imagination, and
only three per cent of thirty-five-year-olds do. School and
many of the systems we inhabit condition us to follow rules and
patterns, repeating them forever. The breaking of patterns is not
encouraged, in fact it’s outlawed. I know now that a score of 99+
is a score in following rules and the established order – the exams
are patterns, and the 99+ students had successfully played the key
points and learnings back into the exams. We’ve become robotic
in our examination. And now the robots are starting to do the
assignments for us. We must be wary of how we score intelligence.
The seeds of this were germinating as I sat in journalism class,
in 2003, at one of humanity’s most critical junctures in human-
generated mass communication. The impending demolition of the
traditional print presses and established news outlets was coming
down the mountain – journalism was under threat. We were on
course to lose our guides, the empowered, activated citizens
with a moral code who engaged in civil matters and discourse
in order to connect micro and macro political and business
actions and trends, who sniffed out the story, who could see the
tangential patterns emerging, the system at large, and could then
help provide context for all citizens to understand the moving
machinations behind the scenes of this Earth play we act in
every day.
When Kabir and I went out to university parties, I experimented
with flipping the script of small talk on its head. We would find
ourselves in conversation with others, and I’d say, ‘So what do you
want to do with your life?’ They’d mostly bumble through the answer
to the question, and then reply, ‘And you?’
3334
Hoodie EconomicsSmall Big Talk
I’d reply, with punch (and a slightly obnoxious energy), ‘I’m going
to change the world.’
I don’t want to stick to small talk, because I know how much
potential we have, and I think when we get it moving, when we get
the music to a beat that opens us up, when the colour of the room
opens our mind, when we find ourselves freed from ourselves, then
woohoo, we got ourselves a space of imagination and change.
Less small talk makes room for big talk. And big questions.
Here’s one: with what we’ve inherited, can we make a fairer world?
I think we can.
The moment has presented itself with every nation on Earth
staring down climate challenges, with every nation on Earth facing
a generational shift in labour with the rise of our robotic and
computerised systems and intelligence, and with a modern design
imperative from many governments and businesses in many nation
states to achieve equitable outcomes for all human beings, with a
drive to equal opportunity for all genders, races, cultures.
As we rise on the waves of the seas and dance with pandemics,
through to the way we live on the most very basic level with the
internet and automation, it is not outrageous to say that we’re in
a bit of a moment, a chance to really go deep into our design of
society, to think, to reflect, and to pull on one of the biggest levers
we have, economics, and ask – what are we to value? What is the
profit we are measuring? What is the future of labour? What is life?
These are questions that I’ve ended up facing every single morning
before breakfast, they haunt my nightmares and fuel my dreams,
trying to think about how to face up to the giant of inequality and
throw a punch that might land.
Back in 2016, I was lying on the floor of our old apartment
with my partner, Yael, in Queens, New York, listening to thesecond Hillary and Trump presidential debate on the radio, and
considering two major thoughts. One re Obama, and one re the
white man. The first re Obama was reflecting on the end of the
era of a hero that I’d looked up to from across the seas, from my
apartment in Coogee, Sydney, whose poster was up on the wall
for all of my twenties. Barack Obama, who felt as important to me
in the name of hope as Nelson Mandela, as Mahatma Gandhi, as
heroes from my country like Vincent Lingiari.
I was drawn to Obama as a hero because I wanted to see the
world change, I wanted people from outside the margins to have
the same opportunities as those inside. I’ve grown up with black
family through my mum’s side, and white family through my dad’s
side, and looking like a white dude experiencing all the benefits,
conscious and unconscious, that life deals out to someone without
black skin, who is six foot two, male – so many of our models of
success have been designed for someone who looks like me, not
someone who looks like my mum or granddad. I believe we can
pull the levers that move the system at large, to see beyond our
skin colour or nationhood, to the biggest possible picture.
The second major thought was on the white man, as we
considered what might happen next in the US. I said out loud:
‘I know this isn’t a popular idea, but who’s gonna design the
economic transition program for the white dudes who won’t
get work anymore?’ For I could see the patterns of movement
bringing diversity into the boardrooms. There are all these people
of a certain shape and size conditioned to inherit wealth and
power – and the future models would have to factor in their
transitions, the making of space to work in relation. Otherwise
more Trumps in the future will whip them into frenzies invoking
the rites of yesteryear.

Hoodie EconomicsSmall Big Talk
Economics is our tool to get there.
When I entered university with an intent to organise change,
economics landed in my lap. At nineteen, after a few years
of organising concerts and setting up scholarships for other
Indigenous students, I stumbled across the idea of building a
mentoring bridge between university students and Indigenous high
school students, between those inside and outside the margins.
In 2005 AIME was founded to shift the network, plug a new node
in here, a new path there. Over nearly twenty years we’ve scaled
the model around the world. In Australia 25,000 Indigenous high
school students have been through the program and achieved
educational equality, closing at times a forty per cent education
gap with the non-Indigenous population.
AIME became a real-life economic playground to live in.
I didn’t even realise that through AIME we’d been short-circuiting
financial systems for the most part in a network that focused on
exchanges of time, knowledge and opportunities, driven by what
many would describe as volunteer energy, but what I would see as
the normal behaviour in a well-designed relational kinship system
of connection. We had our relational economy, but how does the
hoodie arrive?
Enter the cold and blustery winter of AIME mentoring’s third
season. The year is 2007; the mentors at Sydney University are
gathered at the meeting place near the statue of Gilgamesh, in
front of the Old Teachers College where the Koori Centre resides.
(The tale of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest surviving literature
texts and second oldest religious text after the Pyramid Texts – to
us at the time, it was a place to meet and get into cars to go to
schools and mentor kids, and a place where the school buses
would land when they came to us. Only later would I learn that itwas King Gilgamesh’s relationship with the uneducated wild man
Enkidu that balanced him out and made him whole.)
As we were waiting in the cold, Clark Webb, one of the key
mentors who helped drive AIME forward in the early days, saunters
up and says, shivering in a red AIME mentor T-shirt, ‘Bruz, we gotta
get hoodies.’
We hardly had any money at the time, and it seemed crazy to
invest the little we had into hoodies. But it also made sense. We
needed a uniform, we needed something to tie us together, across
all the cultures, across the races and ages, to send a signal that we
were connecting with a different set of rules.
We also needed a way of valuing the exchange. The mentors
on campus were giving their time, their knowledge into the
network, the students themselves were giving their time, their
knowledge. The hoodie suddenly became more than just a
garment, it became the token, the coin, the currency in our
little economy.
University students would share fifteen hours of their time
as tutors or peer mentors in the program. If they were being
paid at say the rate of academic tutors, around AU$60 an hour,
that’s $900 per uni student mentor of services – not measured
by transaction, but invested in relations, given into the network,
and flowing onwards. We measured this number of university
hours in the early years, which from 2010 to 2020 saw 258,137
hours in kind from mentors, which was $15,488,220 worth of
mentoring time.
This in-kind gesture, this kindness, this relational currency, is
central in the movement of Hoodie Economics. It requires bridge-
building and the gift of time, it requires trust and a belief in the
decency of the others involved in the exchange, it requires a
3738
Hoodie EconomicsSmall Big Talk
centering of one’s worth. It reminds us that turning up is all that
really matters, time and time again. And that when an expert,
whose time may be valued in a specialised industry at a particular
monetary rate, turns up as a mentor for an hour, the vacuum of the
economy sees their time as equal to the students’, and in doing so
we achieve equality in a bubble – equal in the value and worth of
each other’s time.
As I looked at that $15 million number I could see how a small
group like AIME, which had little resources in terms of access to
financial capital, could generate value. I could see how the hoodie
that our mentors wore was a constant currency that connected
the kindness, the actions, the impact. Our mentor hoodie could
not be bought. It was exchanged for the time, knowledge and
opportunities being offered by the volunteer mentors. (We’ve
explored other AIME hoodies as fundraisers over the past twenty
years and have gone full circle back to the core: no transactional
hoodies, all must be in relations, centred on change, on action,
that’s where the value can be maintained, not by suddenly
slamming an arbitrary $ on the end of the story.)
The hoodie is a symbol. Batman – as Bruce Wayne – says that
as a man he can only be so much, but as a symbol he can be so
much more.
From Batman to Mandela. When Mandela walked onto
Johannesburg’s Ellis Park to don the Springbok jersey during the
1995 rugby World Cup after apartheid, he showed what could
happen when we put on the common thread.
Mandela’s former bodyguard, Rory Steyn, once shared with
me that on Mandela’s first day as president, the first time Rory
was working with him, Mandela left an event and got into his
car. As they were driving off he spotted an old police colonel.Mandela said to his driver, ‘Stop the car, let me out.’ Mandela
stepped out, moved past Rory, and walked up to the colonel, who
was white, and said, ‘I want you to know that from today forward,
there’s no more “you and us”. You are now our police, too.’
The colonel started to cry, and Rory, who had been in the police
force that had defended apartheid, suddenly said to himself, I think
I have been wrong, and I think I need to give this a chance. After
thirty years of conditioning, within three months he was a believer
in a South Africa for everyone, and he explained that it changed
all through the generosity and bigness of Mandela’s heart, his
reaching out for universal relations.
The hoodie as a symbol is more closely related to young
people outside the margins than say a suit. When a business
leader puts on a hoodie, it says something; likewise when a prime
minister or lawyer wears the hood and then a kid on the street
sees that fancy-looking person wearing the same hoodie as them.
In this moment, the holder of power from inside the margins
says, ‘Hey, I see your intelligence, let me learn your ways. Let me
don your uniform for a bit.’ Unlikely connections, connected by a
common thread.
That’s as complex and as simple as why the hoodie in Hoodie
Economics – it’s how we value and connect the ongoing unfurling
threads of the network’s exchanges of time and knowledge.
The Oxford English Dictionary states economics to be ‘the branch
of knowledge concerned with the production, consumption, and
transfer of wealth’. And it’s in this domain that we get to ask: what
is wealth? What is it that we value? Gold is decided to be of value,
3940
Hoodie EconomicsSmall Big Talk
so then we centre that in the exchange. It becomes the anchor
which all returns to.
Over the last four centuries, colonial empires instated their
definition of value around the world. Castle walls were built, with a
small group inside the walls, inside the margins, and huge swathes
outside, killed, ostracised, told they had no intelligence, no value,
no worth in this new order – no recognised wealth in a world
where the scorecard was filled with coins.
Right now we are labouring under inherited world orders,
systems in the forms of schools, capital exchange, housing, all
of it managed through a pipeline designed with a very small lens
on what was valuable. Progress has come in the shape of a few
drawbridges being built, while the kings and queens invite those
upon whom they had imposed genocide into the tea room to say,
‘Now you may be included as citizens in our empire.’
And in doing so we’ve invited those outside the margins in
to play with the same rules we’ve inherited that excluded those
very people.
The biggest travesty here is we are asking those people to leave
at the door their superpowers, their systems thinking, their models
of wealth and value, their patterns, their shapes, their designs.
We are missing the window for human transformation at a
critical time that Earth needs new intelligence. The trick is, the
‘new’ intelligence is already here, in the rear-view mirror, in the
stars, in the ground, in the animals, in the land; it’s stored, locked
away, waiting for us to find it. The total intelligence pie that has
been activated in the human experience during these last four
centuries is tiny.
The ‘new’ intelligence isn’t going to be revealed through people
from outside the margins entering systems that have never valuedthem until now, and then performing a mystery transformation to
write and speak and dress like the oppressors of yesteryear. The
intelligence is going to come in the form of unlocking the longest
stores of human relations, the different models of economics
already explored, successfully, in longer human models of society.
These models are in relation beyond human to human; they are
in relation to nature, to today, to tomorrow, and that’s what I refer
to when I refer to Indigenous systems thinking – long custodial
models of being shepherds and guides.
The prestigious MIT Media Lab research facility in
Massachusetts was founded the same year I was born. It’s
currently thirty-seven years old. Australia’s Indigenous living lab
has been running for 60,000+ years. Maybe we should be sending
our scientists, artists and designers to document and heroise
our Indigenous systems playgrounds, rather than plucking out an
Indigenous person to go and think in a thirty-seven-year-old lab.
For different outcomes we must experiment with the rules. I’m
interested in a collective intelligence that transcends and lifts the
human knowledge experiment to new heights. I’m interested in
how the knowledge from those outside the margins can be valued
in parallel to the knowledge systems of the last four centuries.
And not under some bizarre deference to a heritage-listed cultural
practice – I’m talking real-life systems knowledge and patterns
and intelligence. Zeroing in to explore what a model of economics
would look like that values relations as the centre point, where the
value of our worth is connectedness to each other and the world
around us.
To navigate how to design the rules of tomorrow we must
dance in a systems thinking world, to zoom out to the largest
possible frame, the frame of the universe, to affirm the simplest of
41Hoodie Economics
realities that we are all interconnected, that it began with a star
and will end with us being swallowed by a star. In between we call
a blue dot home, with a fragile wrapper holding us together.
To continue the zoom out, let’s look at our inheritance.
42INHERITANCE
This is a painting of our inheritance: a bar code, a transactional
receipt, a set of linear patterns, mainly black and white, with colour
every now and again breaking through. It’s top down, gravity
keeping us grounded, stick to your lane, specialised, segmented,
broken up by pigments and parallel living. What we have inherited
has us always looking up the river, hoping to reach the top of the
wealth game, only to find that there is an edge of the canvas, just
a cliff, and we strive for the beyond until we fall off the edge, only
to learn too late that life is lived in the river, that’s the true current-
see, the life is in our living.
In capitalism there is a base-level assumption that human
beings have limitless desires; limitless growth then ensues as a
design principle. This fundamentally defies natural laws, of which
two are the most central in human life: we are born, and then
we die. Along the way we grow – physically, mentally, spiritually.
For some, the growing stunts along the way, but the basic arc
still holds: born, live to a position of strength, begin to decay, die.
That goes for every being on Earth.
4546
Hoodie EconomicsInheritance
Human beings have limits. We have a lifespan. We have limited
growth. Fact. Our exchange systems should mirror natural laws
of life and death, of regeneration and succession. Our exchange
systems should have limits.
Let’s stay on limitless growth for a moment. One of the logic
threads stitching together the capitalism quilt is that market
growth grows the pie for everyone. Better lives for all. One of the
biggest connective tissues in this argument is labour – jobs. Jobs
lead to more wealth that leads to more taxes. If conditions are
good for business to grow, there are more jobs.
But. Here’s the but: in 2013, two researchers from the University
of Oxford, Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, published a
significant research paper on automation, declaring that in the
next twenty years forty per cent of jobs in the US would be gone
because of automation.
In 2020 I’d been talking to filmmaker Cheryl Houser about
potentially making a documentary on AIME. Cheryl invited me toher house, saying, ‘I’m hosting an event for a presidential hopeful,
a young guy who I think you’ll love to meet.’ The next scene
opens and I’m in a small apartment in the Upper West Side of
New York at a fundraiser for Democrat candidate Andrew Yang,
who is talking about the coming automation of jobs. He said
driverless cars aren’t being created for individuals; it’s so we can
have driverless trucks, and companies can rid themselves of
the expense of truck drivers, one of the five major employment
sectors in the US. The speaking tech robots infiltrating our
homes, cars, calendars, inboxes and everything else are
eradicating the need for another of the top five employment
sectors, administration. And online shopping threatens a third
major sector, retail workers. Yang, who advocates for universal
basic income (UBI, more on that to come), has since left the
Democrats, saying he will achieve more outside the system as
an independent.
Watch my hands carefully, this is not a magic trick. More
growth, more jobs, more taxes, more wealth ... that’s the
theory. Now enter the robots who don’t pay tax, and take our
jobs. Suddenly fewer jobs. And less taxes. Just more profit for
the owners of the robots and the processes that have been
computerised.
Is it now that the capitalism logic thread breaks? Is market
growth still growth for all?
I’m with Yang in saying: congrats tech peeps, you did a real
smart thing; now we’ve created all this efficiency, maybe the future
of life isn’t work, maybe it’s time we got the tax from the uber-rich
tech one-percenters who have automated so many of our jobs,
and with that revenue share for everyone, in the form of an income,
thanks to the robots.
47Hoodie EconomicsInheritance
This has been coming for quite a while now. In 1935 the
philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote In Praise of Idleness that
perhaps we could go from an eight-hour working day to a
four-hour day as automation increases productivity. Martin Luther
King was talking about universal basic income in the 60s.
The key point here is that UBI isn’t welfare, it’s an investment in
relations. Stimulus in a relational economy. Reclaiming time back
like Russell says, so we can relate to each other and to nature.
Time freed, us freed, to relate. Part of the opportunity when we
remove growth in financial assets as the core target is that we can
have growth in our relational health and wealth – and time. I would
love to have more time. (On that, through the book we’ve included
a few reminders to take a break – here’s the first, the rest will
just appear.)rules will underpin our new ways of business, our new models of
thinking? What will be at the heart of our human desire?
What will our nation states look like?
What are we schooling our kids for?
What are we working towards?
What stories are we writing?
What heroes are we holding up?
Will we strive to be limitless or limited?
On limits, Japanese author Haruki Murakami put it beautifully
in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,
saying that he’s learned that the moment he’s in flow, when he’s
writing really well, he stops. Because that means he’ll have a great
place to pick up from the following day. Limits today, to ensure
richness tomorrow.
Human beings are limited. We need rest, for example.
Being awake and active is not limitless. Just one night of sleep
deprivation can negatively affect your hippocampus, the area of
the brain central to memory and learning.
We can’t breathe outside our atmosphere.
We can’t run faster than 50 km/h.
We can’t drink endless liquid or eat endless food.
Are we being honest with ourselves when we build an economy
and a society around a foundational idea that human beings
have limitless ambition and desire, and that there is capacity for
limitless growth?
For all of our imaginings at AIME – which have included
imagining a university, a nation, lives for puppets, a feature film,
a radio and TV network, a fashion label, economies – the true
potential of the idea was released only when obstacles and limits
were placed in their path. Imagination allows us to navigate
As we enter this next phase, there are lots of questions to
navigate. In the short term, how do labour parties protect workers
when their jobs are taken by robots and computers? What sort of

the immovable object, and slide through on the tail wind of the
unstoppable force, which then propels us up and over the object
and with a hang-gliding drift into a different sphere. Every ‘no’,
every door closed creates a reason to weave deeper.
So maybe limits = more imagination. And more imagination =
more intelligence. I like the way academic and historian James
Carse put it in his 1986 book Finite and Infinite Games: ‘Finite
players play within boundaries; infinite players play with
boundaries.’
Perhaps the pathway from limited to free can be designed
if systems create limitations. Perhaps the immovable object
allows us time to settle, to be still, to breathe. Perhaps building
economies on limited growth could create the inverse effect of at
once stabilising and centering human happiness, and in parallel
activating the necessary design parameters for accelerated
imagination development.
What would happen with the acceptance of obstacles, of
endings, the design with limitations in our financial tools and
organisational lives? Could it be through a focus on limitations
that we would be able to reach a point in our lives where we
are satisfied?
Our inheritance is a network outta balance.
One crazy idea is that we don’t actually have to work. We don’t
have to have an economy where all roads lead to a job. We can
serve, we can relate, we can connect, we can teach and learn, we
can exchange, we can be. We don’t have to work all our lives in
order to pay off a house that we can never afford anyway, to follow
the allure of ‘the socials’, while the kings and queens sit back
laughing as we contribute to their empires. And then the kings andqueens go to bed alone in their huge castles, crying because they
don’t want to die.
Ahh death. We see death as the worst thing, the thing we don’t
talk about. I’ll serve up the main meal on death in the final chapter,
for now let me offer this entree.
We die.
Our inheritance is a network outta balance, because we aren’t
placing value in the places that create balance. Our wealth
valuation is stacked too heavily in the ledger of the financial.
What about the wealth to be found in joy?
Knowledge is synched up almost every step of the way with
a monetary valuation. Certain schools cost certain amounts,
tutors cost certain amounts, hours applied to study equals a
certain number in final exams, which equals enrolment in the most
valuable courses, which are the ones that are most likely to lead to
well-paid jobs, because universities are designed to make a profit
these days, instead of promoting the growth of minds. Those minds
then enter the workforce to earn a number to one day own more
things and stuff that is worth more numbers to show people their
worth through their numbers and the things worth numbers.
But numbers can’t measure joy.
Imagine a young police officer in a room with their sergeant.
(And if the following seems far-fetched, is it really so abnormal to
expect police to be a force for good? Is it any more far-fetched
than going to the Moon?)

up the challenge with its ‘Wellbeing Budget’, which the Australian
government is actively considering.
There are so many flawed models hiding behind numbers
on spreadsheets, rolling targets, automating human thinking to
distract us from our bodies and ourselves, from our connections.
Do all roads lead to owning a home? A fixed asset, something
fixed to the ground, that has value, on land that had all the trees
removed, and by the way, do you own that land? Land stolen by a
group purporting to represent the ‘common wealth’. Then what?
Fill the house with stuff? Avoid the thought of pain? Or displace
the pain via a news feed that then moves you into a threatened
state, so you buy more stuff? Then the floods or fires come, and
the house and the stuff are gone. What measurement system of
numbers can keep up with that?
When everything is measured in money, it takes us to bizarro
reality. Coca-Cola is definitely not happiness, it’s grown-ups sitting
around corporate offices thinking about how to sell sugar and
caffeine to more kids. Is that the meaning of a human life? The
final pursuit? That’s the top of the tree, the executive suite, with
the big salary, and guess what? The feeling when you get to the
top is still emptiness. Because we cannot satisfy ourselves with
inanimate objects, which supposedly measure wealth. We are
human, we are satisfied by food, sleep, water, air, love, joy, thinking,
moving, relations, almost anything you can think of that you don’t
have to pay for. No matter how expensive the suit, you’re still
naked underneath.
The tech investment world has taken to calling organisations

‘Gerald, mate I know you’ve topped the fines week in, week out
for the last five years, but you’re bottom of the pile in our new
indicator the government has brought in. You literally scored
zero on joy.’
‘Sarge, how the heck do you even measure joy?’
‘Let me check the manual. “We are looking for harmony, for
prevention of crime, for investment in relations." Mate, I’m with
’em. After a lifetime in the force I can’t look past it being the
worst-case scenario for us to lock up people, for a human being
to become a number. This joy thing is worth a try mate.’
‘So how we gona measure it, Sarge?
‘We’re going to start with bringing the kindest energy we can to
people, and then work it out as we go.’
The station went on to find a way to showcase a data point on energy
that shifted the way policing worked around the world. Gerald and his
sergeant became global leaders and mentors for policing. Gerald went
on to write a book entitled The Joy Police.
Maybe we can make numbers measure joy. One of my
colleagues at the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab at Deakin
University, Dr Chels Marshall, told me about a design she was
working on for the government to have a target to measure joy
released and achieved in any given project. Around the world

can’t be bought, valued in $, because no one can own unicorns,
they are free – imagination is their savannah.
I found myself in a room recently where a financial advisor
plotted a few bullet points on the history of ‘the market’ and
showed how the death of a president and a world war were both
examples of a constant truth: ‘That markets always bounce back.’
And the people nod.
Do markets really always bounce? For whom? What is the
measurement? Oh, the world is on fire, and it’s flooding, glaciers
are melting, the world is hungry, but commodities are rising?
The models we have don’t look at the right things. We value
dollars above all else. And we don’t have to. We don’t value our
relations with each other. We have to redefine value.
When looking at economic models, people love to use the Latin
phrase ceteris paribus, ‘all other things being equal’, focusing on
one or two variables while assuming that everything else is going
to stay the same. So let us assume the Earth is not spinning, the
air is not moving, the tides connected to the moving Moon are
not moving, and that Earth’s eight billion people are not engaged
in a variety of actions right this minute that will have billions of
intended and unintended consequences that will tug and pull
and move us into the future in a multitude of paths and journeys.
Ceteris paribus. Jolly good, carry on.
I can’t accept that. We have to look at the biggest picture we
can, we have to take all things into account at all times. We have
to work with what we know, and activate our imagination to be
able to see the drawbridges to tomorrow from emergent patterns
and signals – from robotics, from computer systems, from online
networks, from wifi networks, from the songs the soil sings, from
everything that is changing all the time – so we can work anddance with this wonderful confluence of energy forces interlinked
and at play throughout our tiny rock in this humongous never-
ending universe we get to call home.
Inequality will not move until we can find impact measurement
systems that can unlock the worth of relations and knowledge
exchanges, while resisting the imperative to keep on using
monetary worth to measure the outputs of that exchange.
We’ve got to shift what we value as wealth.
The American author and speaker Charles Eisenstein
illuminates the problem in his 2011 book Sacred Economics: ‘It is
ironic indeed that money, originally a means of connecting gifts
with needs, originally an outgrowth of a sacred gift economy, is
now precisely what blocks the blossoming of our desire to give,
keeping us in deadening jobs out of economic necessity, and
forestalling our generous impulses with the words “I can’t afford
to do that.”’
Former AIME co-CEO Vhutali Nelwamondo said to me once:
‘Money limits my kindness potential. If a lady wants me to help
her get home with her luggage and I only have $50, and she
needs $50, but I’ve already budgeted $25 for food for the week,
I can then only give her $25 and wish her all the best, and she
keeps asking for more money. But if I don’t think about money, I’ll
grab a wheelbarrow, borrow it from someone, and walk with her
as far as we must travel, and I’ll get the greatest gift of my life –
unplanned adventure and conversation and joy from the giving.
There are really no limits to my kindness, but there are limits to
my money.’
Most communities outside the margins have stronger relations
and more joy than the nuclear family hiding inside the gates
opening another bottle of expensive champagne to cloud the
5556
Hoodie EconomicsInheritance
distant echo of a voice inside saying, I’m sad. Who’s inside or
outside the margins when joy is the measure?
And we are all in inequality when the world burns, floods, and
kills us.
We are all in inequality when money becomes a socially
excusable right for all manner of human wrongs. That carries the
echoes of the empires that tried to wipe out the peoples who had
moved so intelligently across our Earth’s surface for thousands
upon thousands of years.
Does the market value or measure death? The way we exit?
If we were more focused on death, not hiding it as a secret,
then it couldn’t be used against us as a manipulative tool to make
us buy, behave and live like we don’t die.
Maybe you don’t matter, maybe I don’t matter, maybe we are
not that important. In 7.5 billion years the Sun is gonna consume
the Earth – it’s all going to end. But at least 10^10^10^7 universes
will keep flowing, give or take a billion here, a billion there. Our
universe has another 22 billion years to flow.
Release – you’re enough.
You’re here for a very short time. Don’t hide with stuff. Live.
When you die, is money the final score? Nah man, it’s got no soul.
You want a life that lives on? Knowledge passed on, how you
made people feel – that’s what lives on. Your relations with family,
friends, your kindness to strangers, your exchanges of joy. You
live on in other people; you leave things behind. Maybe a happy,
healthy life isn’t an externality or offset?
The failings in money as a measurement system for worth,
success and progress are that it doesn’t show complexity, it
rarely values ethics, it struggles to promote health, and can’tpower kindness. Money doesn’t measure the breadth of relations
between human beings, nor between human beings and nature.
We don’t have to distract ourselves with a fragile and sad
pattern that all roads lead to work, and all work leads to money,
and that when we achieve this we’ve made it. We are simply,
much much more than our work. Work is a prime example of
how identification can entrap us. We can feel like something,
or someone, because of a title on a card or a uniform we wear.
In founding our life story behind ‘I’m a doctor’ or ‘I’m a teacher’, we
leave no space for the person to just be themselves, the soul, the
wanderer, the smile, the heart, the being. And the oneness that
we have shaped around work, that oneness can have the effect of
dividing us from our human oneness. ‘I’m a lefty.’ ‘I’m a coal worker,
we hate lefties.’
I can’t see a model down the road that doesn’t involve a
dramatic shift from our current attachment to work as an identity.
It’s scary to make space for our own being. It’s scary because
the mind, soul, brain, our bodies, our hearts, our feelings, they are
complex, they are in movement, they are unhinged, detached from
logic, out of control, and when we are not distracted, it’s a lot to
be with oneself. I’m certain that there is a richness beyond any
paycheque. We just don’t yet measure it.
But it’s not just about work and money – it’s about this
underlying concept of ownership that money brings. Can any of us
put our hand up and say, ‘I own Planet Earth’? Ridiculous, right?
What about ‘I own my share in Planet Earth’? Maybe more than
a few people would accept the premise. ‘I own my own land’?
Of course.
Wait, what?

Where is the deed back to the dinosaurs who enlivened the
land I write on now? How do I pay back the star that exploded?
We don’t own Earth, none of us do. Ownership creates all
this opposition, division, sales, debt. We are not owners, we
are custodians, we are guardians of the land, we are translators
between plants and animals. Our intelligence allows us to help life
enhance its connective tissue; at best, we may be conductors, but
more likely we are riding along the waves of existence like pollen
on the breeze.
The longest human success stories on Earth are tales of
custodianship, of moving with the land, learning from the land,
working in and out of time and space, being freed from individual
claims of power and ownership. We have inherited models of
ownership from financial markets and colonial law. I’ll say it again –
our inheritance is a network outta balance.
In Australia in 1992 we had a breakthrough land rights decision
known as the Mabo case, and the legislation that followed forced
on us the frame that Indigenous people must prove we are the
‘Traditional Owners’ of the land. Unpack those two words for a
minute with me, ‘traditional’ and ‘owners’.
‘Traditional’ recognises a long-established process – but
it also sends a signal that this is in the past. That to establish
traditional ownership we must just repeat the past. It feels like
yesterday, and yes that’s an important part of the flow, but what
of today and tomorrow?
How about ‘contemporary owners’?
Doesn’t quite do it, the owner bit is the challenge isn’t it?
I don’t think you’d find an Indigenous thinker on Earth who
would point to the riverways, the trees, the animals, theknowledge passed on and say, ‘I hereby assert my individual
ownership of all of these species and this land.’ No, ownership is
not the concept here.
Do we protect the land, listen to the land, work with nature?
Yes, of course. Are we custodians? Representatives of the land?
Yes we are.
‘Contemporary custodians?’ Maybe that’s more alive. We are a
custodial species.
When we are owners, we protect, but we also divide, we put
up walls, we keep knowledge as secrets. These are the very things
that are the failings of the financial model. When our Indigenous
systems of living become governed by flawed systems of language
and processes imported from other frameworks, we lose access to
our proper inheritance, our intelligence.
Our role as humankind is to be custodians of Planet Earth. I’ll
keep coming back to that Ray Charles line: ‘None of us own the
notes, we are just lucky enough to hold them for a while before we
pass them on.’
Ownership creates a sense of permanence, but life is
impermanent. Life has limits. Ownership is at odds with life.
The sooner we set the intent to design the systems of tomorrow,
the sooner they will emerge, and the sooner we can see these
inherited systems for what they are – reductive systems designed
for the prosperity of a very few, that have deep flaws in their
capacity for true richness, because they keep life out.

Emergent design is natural design. It is synched up with a
recognition that human beings do not control Earth, that we are
elements in a much more powerful system. Emergent designs
are adaptable and allow us to consider our place in a larger
framework.
What is a human-designed system? It’s a collection of
interweaving intentional and unintentional connected actions and
reactions moving within a framework that has been designed by a
human being to drive certain behaviours by other human beings.
It’s interlinked with every other system, whether it recognises it or
places value in it, and all the systems dance together.
Human systems at their best capture intelligence from all
possible angles. Same in nature: I love the system of mycelium,
the billions of strands of underground fungus that connect trees
in a forest. It’s a model for movement, for cross hatching and
interweaving, for multiple highways to move knowledge and water
and sugar underground, to help trees communicate and feed
each other.
Then there’s Indigenous familial mapping systems, whereby
relations can have movement, where one can be both an uncle
and a nephew, the leader becoming the follower, the observer and
then the leader again. The relations are not fixed, but the frame
has strength. There is order, there is structure and emergence.
I spent the first ten or so years of my work in this field –
creating networks and designing systems – being informed by
mainstream ‘strategic’ templated models. From business schools
to consulting groups, I looked to organisations that I thought were
all-knowing. I visited the Google offices in Silicon Valley for the
first time in 2012, then the Stanford campus where I met businessleaders from around the world, and the Nike head office when I
visited my friend who leads the Air Jordan design team. I read the
Harvard or Stanford business cases, followed the Social Ventures
Australia gameplan and models informed by Macquarie Bank, Bain
& Company and McKinsey. They were the heroes, and formulas
were the strategy. The key messages I kept receiving were: scale,
find efficiencies, measure the impact in numbers, show the return
on financial investment. Results and outcomes and awards were
the benchmarks.
The energy was competitive. I wanted to win, to beat the
structures of power at their own game. There was always an
enemy. The language was about pitching, about convincing the
sceptic, everyone had agendas and hidden agendas, deference
was to be paid to the richest, and don’t forget to grow grow grow.
And once that’s all done and the dollars are in the bank and the
numbers are there and the reports are written and the awards
have been won and the great team squeezed into a formula –
once all this has been triaged and reported and sequenced,
then work on your succession plan and you’ve won the business
model game.
After a decade or so, I was working towards the final play of the
measured model of grow, succeed, then build a foreverness into
your work. As I did, I realised I’d managed to make the organisation
repeatable, predictable, and in doing so I felt deep in my bones
that I had sentenced AIME to a long and slow death, the worst
sort of death, institutionalisation and slow decay, by playing within
the established frame. I had a lot of questions, and few answers.
For one, should non-profits grow? (I dig into those questions more
in the final chapter of this book.)

Through a couple of breakdowns, bouts of extended depression,
deep challenges of my leadership, my vision, from within myself
and outside, I questioned the discipline and control that had got
me to where I was. In 2016, when I stood on a stage in New York
and said AIME can change the world and I can help lead it, it threw
me into the washing machine of accelerated learning. Fuelled by
the fear of everything I didn’t know about the world, I bought every
book from the Oxford PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics)
course, subscribed to The Economist, The New York Times, New
Yorker, The Guardian. I read and read and read, and tried to catch
up to the tidal wave I had thrown the AIME ship onto.
As I lived, I learned. I met people all over the world. I lived in
NYC and tried to get AIME on the map, I got jealous of others
on the map, and I hated my jealousy. I got competitive. I was an
underdog. I was chasing and chasing. And then I started drawing
and then eventually painting. I opened my imagination, and then
opened my heart to love. I got my mind and body and soul into
a place where I could see the system at large. I realised the best
thing, it’s right here, with you already, and that’s all we ever have.It took me thirteen years of schooling, graduating from the
University of Sydney and Stanford biz school, over 10,000 hours
with AIME in my life, a global quest, so many books and humans
and experiences, and with all that learning only now was I staring
to see that everything is right here. Which takes me back to
school. In school (and subsequently across human life), I see a
debt mindset that creates fear, leaving us as a species with a
whopping imagination deficit. A system outta balance.
There is a comprehensive difference between exams driven
by fear, as distinct from reflection that forms and consolidates
knowledge. Part of the blockage is our desperation to measure
everything – you know, 83.7 per cent, A+, with zero attempt to
measure or value imagination. To value processes of exploration.
We aren’t lacking in tools. Teachers can teach. Many of our
processes for comprehension are useful, they are just strangled by
the measurement systems. An essay, for example, in its essence is
a pathway for the mind to explore. As is a piece of creative writing.
The flaws are in our design frames of what we ask from these
forms. Could we test maths intelligence by asking students to
create a film on mathematical deduction? We could ask students
to create a theatre show on the power of physics, and perform it
at school assembly, suddenly not kept secret but shared richly and
openly via story. With robots now able to spit back the answers to
exams, maybe this form of story to measure and share knowledge
becomes the only way we can examine whether a student actually
comprehends and a robot hasn’t done the work. Back to the
future, anyone?
If you imagine a lighthouse shining on a classroom of thirty
teenagers, in the current system, at best, twenty kids are lit up
while ten are in the dark. To light up the whole room, we need to
6364
Hoodie EconomicsInheritance
make a space for emergence, and in that space activate unlikely
connections and teach with imagination. We’ve gotta loosen the
grip of control to develop a learning system that is enlivened with
the designs and perspectives from outside the margins.
When we look over the horizon to the emerging world, are we
developing skills for problem-solving in the face of automation,
are we developing resilience in the face of climate change, are
we developing synergy and systems thinking at scale interlinking
all our subjects and pieces? Isn’t this the time to tap into the
intelligence everywhere?
The COVID-19 pandemic is the most significant moment for the
internet since Tim Berners-Lee invented it. And I’d argue it’s the
most significant moment of educational re-imagining since we
inherited the Prussian model – originally designed to bring children
into compliance with the state and its military leaders – as the
foundation for Western education some two centuries ago. What
we inherited was order, rules, structure, control. We inherited
patterns that train through fear of failing. We inherited patterns
that position the teacher as an authority, a military leader. We
inherited processes of efficiency. These systems fed into the
Industrial Revolution, which made the world we have today –
and through which we lost our relationship to nature, and our
imagination.
The internet has cultivated an environment where the sharing
and dissemination of information has flourished, at times more
than the human mind can handle. The internet has allowed space
for the mass manipulation of audiences, most notably through the
social media giants who claim to unite us, but frequently abuse
the platform to sell advertising, fear and divisive messaging. Young
people wade through mountains of misinformation to find the goldnuggets, the wisdom, the trusted source. As Berners-Lee said on
a BBC podcast in 2005: ‘... if you go randomly picking up pieces
of paper in the street or leafing through garbage at the garbage
dump, what are the chances you’ll find something reliable written
on the paper that you find there? Very small. When you go onto
the internet, if you really rummage around randomly, then how do
you hope to find something of any value?’
There’s a lot of garbage out there and there have been few
guides systemically planted that can help us make sense of the
world; our journalists have been gutted in the last ten years, and
one of the remaining guides are our teachers. Their agenda is
our kids’ education, unlocking their minds and guiding them to
the nuggets.
The pandemic has radically changed how teachers interact
with students. We have, overnight, adapted and imagined new
paradigms, where teachers have crossed the line to the world
of the students, via Zoom, YouTube, Canva, Google Classroom
and WhatsApp. Today kids know more about the tools of their
classroom than their teachers do. We’ve had centuries of kids
going to buildings and halls; now the kids are welcoming teachers
to their building – the internet. The kids have the tools, the
teachers can guide them to the path.
Can we re-imagine how we deliver education? We just have.
We now know that governments can act quickly: we’ve learnt
that economic policies can change overnight, that planes can be
grounded, cars can be stopped from moving and people can too.
That everything can just stop.
Let us not waste this moment for an education revolution –
which also depends upon warp-speeding internet connectivity as
a modern human right for all.

Here’s a napkin-sketched path to re-evolving education, to
prepare students for the 21st century, sharing the collective load
of education across the village and allowing teachers to refine and
re-energise for the modern era:for smaller classes and more concentrated connections. Then
bring in the village. For example:
1. Flip the classroom – invest in tools like non-profit online
education outfit Khan Academy to make the curriculum
relevant for every school system in the world and give
kids the chance to study at home, then flip the classroom
experience to make it about discussing the content. The
internet means that kids know how to access information;
instead use the time in school for the most critical sentence
in learning: ‘I don’t understand.’
2. Bring in the mentors – ensure that every student has a
mentor in their life who can help with school questions, life
questions, and embracing a failure mindset to learning. For
the mentors it creates sources of intelligence from outside
their margins. For society it patterns us in healthy relational
patterns: diagonal, not linear.
3. Embrace a world view – when we leave physical classrooms
and teach from the internet, there are suddenly no walls and
no limits: schools can now bring in experts from any field,
anytime, anywhere.
4. Natural intelligence – time patterned in nature, finding
intelligence from nature, and returning intelligence to nature.
5. It takes a village (to educate the students) – I love the
model that was experimented with in NSW Education during
COVID-19: kids come into school one day a week. This allows
66
A. A day at university – embrace the Ancient Greek model
of the acropolis of learning and have high school students
on campus one day a week, working out of the university
library, being guided by university students as mentors and
with lecturers giving guest lessons for the cohort.
B. A day at home, and a more focused day at school for
those being left behind – so that students can have more
connection with their families and communities, and
those who need it can have more engaged time with
their teachers.
C. A day of service – now is the time to give identity to a
generation that, thanks to robotics and computerisation.
is facing unemployment. So make this the generation of
service, tasked with creating a fairer world, whether that
is through working with a national park, disaster relief,
mentoring, coding, creation or community services.
D. Turn exams into stories – bring the examination to life,
with story as the framework, imagination as the process,
knowledge as the outcome.
E. Activate and publish the knowledge. Don’t hide away
billions of essays and ideas, share them openly and freely
as sparks and threads for us all to learn from and weave
together. Have students working in schools as imagination
labs solving challenges right now, global systemic
challenges – let’s not waste a second.

Our inheritance in the modern world is reductive thinking, and
this reductive thinking has reduced our relations to transactions.
We have lost some of the mental muscles to access more than our
specialised world view. We’ve defended our individual intelligence
and created competition in the very space – the sharing of
knowledge and cultivation of intelligence – that should be given and
open and co-operative.
As a cancer cell can kill a body, a person or an institution
can infect a system by their individual control of the notes of the
universal song. By holding the secrets for themselves, they ruin
the universal wealth connection and create a break in the flow.
It’s all about flow.
All roads must not lead to measurable productivity in the form
of a number. More does not mean more. Do we need thousands of
manufactured digital connections in our online persona? Or will
five really rich relations with actual people be enough? How much
time do we have? How much knowledge will we acquire? How
many opportunities will we receive? And what will we give?
We pass on DNA, we pass on energy; we leave behind money
and stuff. We pass on knowledge that can live beyond us.
David Graeber gets it in his 2012 The First 5,000 Years of Debt,
which illuminates our inheritance of life as debt: ‘If our lives are
on loan, who would actually wish to repay such a debt?’ Release
yourself from a debt mindset. You are enough.
‘The market’ doesn’t control life. Life is wonderfully out of

ourselves in and go along for the ride, and let life emerge. Let
control go and then watch what happens.
I work really differently now to how I did ten years ago or

Nowadays, sustained glows of energy are what I’m drawn to –

Tyson Yunkaporta once said to me: ‘The dreaming (all
knowledge of all life of all time) is everything, and life is a process
of it being revealed to us.’
The dreaming is everything, everywhere, all the time, and we
can all access the deepest, longest knowledge processes by being
custodians of the land, in relation to nature and to each other, by
sharing and moving, and fundamentally by listening. By taking the
time to listen to nature, to each other, to ourselves, to the stars, to
the Moon, to the Sun, to the universe and the universes beyond
our universe, to listen to the notes and the songlines of life before
our time, and to find the flow and our energy in this time, and with
that energy to know our only responsibility is to not block, but to
keep our channel open, to receive and then give, and by giving,
letting life and being and knowledge and wealth flow. You’ve got to
give it away to keep it.

It’s actually in many ways the most intelligent cleaner I’ve seen,
and it’s my humble view that the house is the issue. Actually
it’s an even broader issue: the whole power frame your house

cleaner at all. The cleaner isn’t the problem, it works; the system
you are on doesn’t know how to connect with it.’

The problem isn’t with the vacuum cleaner, it’s with the socket.
Every traveller knows the problem: you travel to Japan, or China, or
England, and your appliances don’t work, because the sockets are
different. You can’t plug in to the power system. The problem isn’t
with the intelligent devices, it’s the limitations with the designs of
the sockets. With the structure of the power system.
Guess what? Same problem with people – people outside the
margins, people coming from different knowledge bases, with
different intelligences: they can’t plug in, so they are excluded.
A legacy of century upon century of discrimination, destruction,
devaluing, desolation, isolation and eradication of the hearts,
minds, souls and beings of anyone or anything who wasn’t a
certain class, race and style of white man. When that happens,
humanity loses its intelligence potential.The design challenge is to rework the power system so
everyone and everything can plug in.
I’m not going to beat you to death with the stick of what’s
gone wrong in the past, but it’s worth a quick recap to reflect
on who wasn’t at the table when power was distributed, and
the nature of economic priorities and ‘limitless growth’ that was
afforded by slavery, by gender inequity, by racial discrimination,
and storytelling that limited human beings to the most simplistic,
dumbed-down version of a human life: the story of a man in a suit
making money.
When does this division start? One argument positions the
early phases of the British Empire in the 17th century as the
time when Christianity, as the class differentiator, becomes
interchangeable with whiteness as a way of generating a societal
design frame for justifying slavery. In the words of Eric Williams,
a historian who led Trinidad and Tobago to independence and
became its first prime minister, ‘Slavery was not born of racism;
rather, racism was the consequence of slavery.’
Does whiteness become the justification for superiority during
this phase? The 1681 Act for Regulating Servants in Jamaica began
to describe the privileged class as ‘white’ not ‘Christian’. This
act was later copied in South Carolina. Two centuries later the
Queensland Aboriginal Protection Act of 1897 provided a national
blueprint for Australian apartheid, which later inspired South Africa
to institute their own apartheid regime, as discussed by many
authors and historians, including journalist John Pilger.
In my country, the longest ongoing intelligent civilisation of
continuous human life, dating back 60,000+ years, was interrupted
without invitation a couple of hundred years ago when the
Brits arrived. Brits stayed. Brits delivered smallpox and other
7374
Hoodie EconomicsPotential
deadly diseases. Brits started wars. Murdered, enslaved, colonised.
With the aforementioned state-based Aboriginal Protection Acts,
intergenerational genocide programs began, stealing children from
their families, taking them to camps, training them to think and
act white, giving them a number in place of a name, landing them
with white families. This carried on until the 1990s, and has now
morphed into a ‘care’ system that sees Indigenous kids removed,
and a policing system that sees Indigenous kids arrested at mind-
boggling rates.
Behind it all lay the White Australia policy, which was one of
the first acts introduced into Parliament when Australia became a
nation in 1901. In 1919, then Prime Minister Billy Hughes hailed the
White Australia Policy as ‘the greatest thing we have achieved’.
Two decades later, after the outbreak of World War II, then
Prime Minister John Curtin reaffirmed its validity, proclaiming:
‘This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of
those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the
South Seas an outpost of the British race.’ Only in 1966 were the
first planks of the policy removed, which took a decade. Only in
1967, thanks to a referendum, were Indigenous people counted in
the census, and properly recognised as citizens.
From India to Nigeria, from Australia to America – man, the
Brits (as well as the French and the Portuguese and the Spanish)
just ploughed through Indigenous peoples’ lives. And to think that
today Australia still has the Queen, whoops, King of England as
our head of state blows my brain apart. The day we celebrate our
nation, 26 January, is the day the British invaded.
Why do we still bow to a foreign monarch? Unpicking this logic
gets us into the very big questions of how we are networked and
what is valued in our networks, the rivers on which the currentsflow, the current-see. How does a nation founded on so much
destruction and exclusion wrestle its way to any semblance of
an equitable design when so many of the streams flowing in the
generational DNA are filled with hatred and division?
In 1776 – twelve years before Australia was invaded – Adam
Smith wrote Wealth of Nations, the foundation text of capitalism.
Smith is very quick – on the second of his thousand-odd pages –
to draw a distinction between workers and savages. ‘A workman,’
he writes, ‘even of the poorest order, if he is frugal and industrious,
may enjoy a greater share of the necessaries and conveniences of
life than it is possible for any savage to acquire.’
There we have it: outright dismissal of the intelligence and
humanity of Indigenous systems and people. Not even regarded as
part of the economic system, let alone excluded.
Smith was also the first theorist of rent and wrote a lot about
labour. The labour was slave labour in many nations, so there was
no valuing of labour at all. Maybe it is time to bring together the
Indigenous populations across the fifty-four countries in the
Commonwealth and present a case to the King to say, ‘We would
like you to pay rent for the last 200+ years of occupation. The rent
will be charged as the market has held, and we are willing to
negotiate the fees on the stolen commodities and the stolen
wages through enslavement.’ As the saying goes: pay the rent.
And that’s how a small group were able to build an empire:
steal the land, pay no rent; steal the labour and pay no wages.
The coins that the Brits brought to Australia were of no use
to those already here. No value either. Captain Cook noted this
in his journal entries from 1770: ‘The Earth and sea of their own
accord furnishes them with all things necessary for life, they covet
not Magnificent Houses, Household-stuff &c., they live in a warm
7576
Hoodie EconomicsPotential
and fine Climate and enjoy a very wholesome Air ... In short they
seem’d to set no Value upon any thing we gave them, nor would
they ever part with any thing of their own for any one article
we could offer them; this in my opinion argues that they think
themselves provided with all the necessarys of Life and that they
have no superfluities.’
That is a different way of thinking. There is scope in our
economic thinking to give more weight to the non-financial.
Imagine a new stock exchange – to see the social enterprise
exchange become the most valuable in the world, receiving the
largest financial investments, knowing that the return would not
just be monetary.
There is also scope to place more value on relations on the
balance sheets of businesses. Think about the in-kind ledger –
what if it could match the financial wealth shared or brought in?
When we value profit, we affirm the values of those inside the
margins. When we value relations, we give ourselves the chance
to move beyond the status quo, to access all of the intelligence at
and beyond the margins. And we need it: the times demand new
thinking, and the largest source of collective human intelligence
has yet to influence our major systems and designs at scale.
In early 2022 I was talking to a vice-chancellor of a university
in Australia and he was saying they have huge plans to get out to
all the remote communities, that they have plenty of places and
space for Indigenous people in the university.
Herein lies the flaw with how we currently network and where
we place value: we are still trying to fit the smart device into a
house with plugs from the 1950s.
My response to the vice-chancellor was: ‘Maybe, instead of
trying to get Indigenous people in to learn a British model of lawor finance that was established over the last few hundred years
and was honed, refined and developed in sandstone buildings
with the design to destroy the lives of Indigenous people, maybe
at this pivotal point in human history where we are reaching
some breaking points due to our ongoing thirst for the everlasting
gobstopper of coal-fired life, maybe there is some intelligence
already with Aboriginal people? Not some weird dated cultural
intelligence that comes into the university yards for a polite
ceremony. I’m talking relational design. Systems thinking.
Economics. I’m wondering if you really want to move the value
and create equity.
'Maybe go out to those communities and offer PhDs, not
honorary PhDs, but for real, at professor’s salaries, and value the
60,000+ years of intelligence that is still alive? Maybe send your
students of law and medicine and business out to these teachers,
so we can learn how to design a society that lives within the
limitations of life?
'And while we are doing it, how about we do the same thing for
a generation of women, of refugees. I reckon we could learn a fair
bit about life by listening to the mothers that birthed us. Perhaps
we could learn a fair bit about design, strategy, communication, by
listening to refugees who have migrated and adapted across the
world and escaped wars.’
We have inherited these self-contained castles from empires,
and at best have built these dodgy drawbridges into them, with the
kings and queens giving permission for those they’ve excluded to
come and play within the castle walls, allowing a few exceptions
to the rule to participate in the private clubs of the world – such
as the private schools and university colleges that reproduce class
structures. To start at the bottom, to learn the ways of the empire,
77Hoodie EconomicsPotential
and to parrot and be like them. The rules keep nature out and
networks in, and there is no valuation of intelligence from outside
the castle walls.
But there can be.measurement like a dollar, but a more holistic look at our relations
to each other, the animals, the plants, the Earth, the stars, the
universe at large.
When we consider what automation will look like, we think of a
Huxleyesque automated human slave existence – but we need not.
Let the robots work and the humans flourish. We could still work –
work on our relations, work on transferring knowledge widely and
freely, work on care and connection to each other and to this tiny
blue dot we get to live on.
With Web3 and the impending acceleration of virtual worlds,
surely we have arrived at the greatest possible moment for the
internet to be the platform for all. We must learn from past failings,
from empire building and limitless growth, embrace Indigenous
systems thinking and other intelligence from outside the margins
in the designs of new economies, networks and currencies in the
virtual worlds – otherwise it’s just the same old people running
the show, just now they are wearing sweatpants instead of suits
or crowns.
Web3 will open up the space for new intelligence – that is,
60,000-year-old intelligence. When the clubs couldn’t meet,
because a pandemic had stopped planes, and human contact
was deadly, then we needed intelligence. Business as usual would
not do; we needed unlikely connections to meet and solve the
challenges ahead.
This to me just seems so obvious, as it’s been my life’s work,
making unlikely connections – they produce imagination and
bring us unstuck. The challenge now is to make these unlikely
connections generative and as systemic as the patterns that
divide us.
We have the chance to enter a new phase of progress – beyond
merely valuing Indigenous culture as a quaint historic oddity, a
relic with no effect on the present and future. We could enter a
new phase, where intelligence from Indigenous systems thinkers
can be the node into the network to enliven the human thought
experiment. We ain’t scratched the surface of the intelligence
that’s sitting outside the margins.
The intergenerational clubs keep power in their hands by
limiting the network. That’s clever if the goal is to keep the wealth
and power in the hands of the few, but it ain’t so clever when
suddenly you need more than the dollars in your bank account.
It ain’t so clever when you need to respond to new challenges you
have never met before.
And why am I optimistic that the network can be opened up to
new intelligence? Because three powerful forces are pushing us
that way. The first is climate change. The second is automation.
The third is Web3. Throw in a pandemic or two for dessert.
When we stare down climate change, there is hope for
imagination, invention, and economic reform to find solutions to
prevent the disaster scenario continuing to unfold. Indigenous
systems thinking would allow us to look at the value of a
whole network connected, not a focused specialised isolated
78
7980
Hoodie EconomicsPotential
Another reason for my optimism is that human beings are
fundamentally decent. We don’t want to harm others, at our core
we want relations and connections. Humans aren’t the problem in
solving inequity – the way we are networked is.
I mentioned attending St Paul’s College at Sydney
University, a club within a club, a networked pathway locking
up knowledge and reproducing privilege and power and empire.
At uni I thought, These guys are the problem, the rich don’t care
about anyone but themselves. They are the ones I have to rebel
against. At the same time I was hanging at the Indigenous
centre and kicking it with a collection of soulful inspired
Aboriginal and Torres Islander people who were all bloody
smart. I positioned the St Paul’s guys as the enemy. And I got
angrier and angrier.
Then the penny dropped. How was I going to ask the Paul’s
boys to look at Indigenous people differently if I couldn’t look at
them differently?
I understood then that they weren’t the problem, the network
was, and I got the greatest gift of my life from this insight. I learned
that you can’t remove people from where they’ve come from, but
instead you must look at where they are, and where they can go.
Cling to the thread of hope, and weave the richest narrative you
can with that singular thread. See the worst in people, and that’s
what you will get.
I expected the best from everyone, and I was astounded by
what people delivered. The Paul’s boys started to help me promote
the concerts for change I was organising. They lined up as mentors
for AIME. They helped launch us globally. They provided the
connection to Johny Mair and Ethic. When the network is filled
with hope, we provide space for movement.I’m with Rutger Bregman, the author of the 2019 book
Humankind: A Hopeful History, who argues that we are basically
decent and cooperative. Adam Smith taught that we improve
and advance because of self-interest; what we need to expand
from, which Indigenous systems have always known, is that your
self-interest is my self-interest. That my wellbeing depends on the
wellbeing of the group. That has never been truer than now, as we
all face the potential devastation of climate change.
When asked to rise, we will; some will disappoint you, but you’ll
be astounded at what happens when you raise the bar.
Let’s zip through a bit more of what got us to today, so we can
get further into our potential for tomorrow.
What got us here is the design of clubs like St Paul’s. Small
clubs of similar-looking, similar-thinking people being isolated
and containing their knowledge to their own quarters. That’s how
empires work, creating in each nation they enter a swathe of
anointed families and institutions to keep the empire and its profits
ticking over.
From the 1960s on, people began asking questions. Power
structures were rejected. Women demanded a place. Black Power
arose. Then the internet supercharged it, and became paramount
with events like the Arab Spring. Suddenly those outside the
margins had a voice, and a place to connect and organise.
We got distracted by the attention economy distracting us.
By Facebook putting us all back into the same old networks. Yet
that same tool, the internet, used to divide us, can just as easily
be used the other way, to break down established networks by
promoting unlikely connections instead.
The focus on the self, self-ie, face-time, face-book, has
created a heightened sense of one’s appearance, one’s skin
8182
Hoodie EconomicsPotential
colour, eye colour, hair colour, body shape, what we are born
with, what we have grown to be. The platforms of our modern
times have created cults of individuality, of identifying and
declaring difference – be it apology or injustice, sorrow or
anger – but in the insistence on identity, very rarely is there
space for complexity. Too often arguments become ad hominem,
focusing not on the idea but the person speaking. Only this
missing complexity can deepen the relations to the level of the
soul, of energy, to balance the differences in our skin colour with
the similarities in our species, and the relations we share with
other species.
We follow the maps that we inherit. We walk down the paths
our parents provide. They navigate the world on the maps they
have access to. The type of map you end up with depends on
the perspective you map from and the tools you make the map
with. These modern internet platforms are as influential if not
more than any directory ever. They move us, nudge us, ask us
to bounce into a different corridor or room. We oblige. And
we shouldn’t.
Instead, we should choose our direction with the guidance of
long maps, the ones that have been here 60,000+ years. These
custodial maps give us access to the maps of the longest source
of intelligence on Earth: nature.
The intelligence is already mapped. Which is what I’ve been
taught about the dreaming – we are in life, finding our way, and
the knowledge and intelligence reveals itself when we are in
relation. That’s why we sing and why we dance. Those songs
and dances are patterns that have transmitted knowledge for
millennia. It’s complex mapping, layered beats and rhythms.So why can’t a company’s strategic plans be painted as
murals? Hearing three songs that explain the plans of an
organisation could be a lot more informative – and interesting –
than another PowerPoint presentation.
The answers are in the maps, and when and where we place
the maps. From whose perspective, when in the design process,
and with what tools.
When we are looking for a way out, we’ve gotta think in map
language, we’ve gotta zoom out and see our town, then zoom
out and see our country, zoom out and see our world, then we’ve
gotta draw diagonal lines back and forward through time, to see
the shapes before and after. As we stand on the edge of the Earth
looking out to the future, we are so close to being able to make a
small tweak here, a little nudge there, and enhance the health of
the designs we have inherited – jumpstarting symbiosis.
In Australia for example, at the start of every meeting and
conference there is now an acknowledgment of Country, where
people pay respect to the Traditional Owners of the land on which
they are gathered. Then they move on with business as usual.
It’s been a big cultural shift, but it can be more, so much more.
There is a chasm between the intelligence being acknowledged
and the processes of business applied thereafter.
I want to see our collective intelligence grow. Acknowledgment
is good, but it’s not enough. The ice is melting, we gotta solve
some challenges, let’s get smarter ASAP.
What if the chasm was closed, like this: ‘Today to acknowledge
the Traditional Owners of the land I want to share an Indigenous
system that I think could inform our work as we think about the
future of medical science. I want to speak about the relationship
8384
Hoodie EconomicsPotential
between Indigenous medicinal mapping and fish oil, the seasonal
relation to harvesting, that when the sunflower is flowering for two
months the fish oil has its medicinal purposes, which it doesn’t
have for the rest of the year. For this conference I want us to
expand our thinking about not just what we do in medical practice,
or why we do it, but how we relate to the world around us, where
our medicine comes from, how we relate to our patients, how we
find intelligence from outside the margins. And to do so, we’ve
asked Indigenous medicine makers to join all of our major design
sessions, as peer designers, so we have the chance to co-design
the models of tomorrow.’
That would be a lot more than just an acknowledgement of
the past. This would be an activation of intelligence – I would love
to see the acknowledgement of Country evolve to become an
activation of intelligence as the ceremony to bring us in.
In July 2022 I was yarning with Johny Mair from Ethic about
the efficient market, where all information must be available
to everyone. Johny explained to me that the process exists to
navigate the complexity of insider trading, that there can be no
alphas in the market who hold secret information that can benefit
them, that secret knowledge that can inform the market must be
shared. Johny then played out how we could place the long human
labs of Indigenous systems thinking into the design of the financial
marketplace, organisational design, impact design.
After sharing our work with investors for a week, we were
gathered for the weekend in upstate New York to breathe deeply
in nature before returning for the last week of investor meetings,
and Johny and I were standing by a lake talking, drinking water,
when Johny said: ‘As far as I see it, Indigenous systems thinkingand intelligence make Ethic an alpha – we have information that
others don’t, and it gives us an unfair advantage.’
Ethic has to share the knowledge: Indigenous systems thinking
is now at the front of the design queue. And the market has to
accept it. The prize for movement out of inequity, and for the next
phase of intelligent human-designed systems, is knocking at the
door of the US financial market; Indigenous systems thinking is
about to become the global competitive edge, and we don’t wanna
hold onto it, we want pass on the knowledge, like we’ve always
done. Activate this and we have moved where we map from,
enlarged the lens and changed the tools.
I sat on an advisory council to the Australian government in
2022 to look at an Indigenous economic model for Indigenous
development. I said the only model should be Indigenous
economics to inform the Australian economy at large. We are
about to have a referendum in Australia on whether to have a
separate chamber to advise the Parliament on Indigenous affairs.
It’s not an Indigenous voice for Indigenous affairs that we need –
what we need is an Indigenous voice for Australian affairs. We
need to be working with the government on health policy for all
Australians, on education for all Australians. Indigenous systems
thinking should inform our whole government.
What gives me the most hope is that all the systems we have
inherited are frames that we can fill with different energy. Sure,
in some places we gotta change the frame too, but for a lot of
progress to happen, we just gotta move around what happens
when, and who is asked what questions, and where the knowledge
is anchored and how. And we can change that tomorrow, in our
meetings, in our families, in our relationship to life, in our financial
85Hoodie Economics
markets and our collective life today and tomorrow – we can do it
when we invest in our relations and where we place our attention.
When I painted this chapter I could see life within and life
without, I could see movement and flow throughout our beings.
I see in the left side the boxes and lines we have drawn to box
us in. The systems and grids we have created for our cities and
towns. The creature featured is maybe a symbol of our being, of all
beings, and the colours and movement are just some of the many
potential sources desperate to energise our collective being if the
drawbridges are let down and new highways of exchange are built
between us all.
When we think about our potential, we shouldn’t box ourselves
into design frames with sharp edges. So many of our design
templates give us boxes to work within – the screen I type on now
is a rectangle, pages are rectangles, with corners that can cut us
when we touch them from the outside, that don’t flow, that block
alongside rectangles and square and shapes like them. Squares
and straight lines are an absolute rarity in nature – but there are
plenty of circles and arcs.
In nature, everything affects everything else: the constant flow
of air is affected by mountain peaks or the sun’s rays; water flows
are affected not just by the land they flow through, but by the spin
of the Earth. The circular pattern flows through our oceans, around
and around and around, as we spin around and around and around.
When we design with currents in mind, we start to have healthier
current-seas.
Circles don’t have edges, they don’t cut, they interlink and
create multi-dimensional shapes, like the Olympic rings. Circles
move, they roll across the topography. Circles don’t have a start
or a stop, they just keep going. That’s our potential: endless,
86
abundant, able to flow and weave with all the other circles, just like
the shape of water.
The answers are in the maps. But the type of map you end up
with depends on the perspective you map from and the tools you
make the map with.RELATIONS
What is a relational economy? How do you measure relations?
How can you measure the value of nature? How do we incentivise
moving the network in unlikely fashions? How do we release the
potential from what we’ve inherited? How do we balance the
intelligence from outside the established margins with what we
have inherited and accepted as valuable from within the margins?
What are our highways of exchange? How the heck do we start to
unpick hundreds of years of patterning of debt in relations? How
do we find a way to release ourselves with joy in the magic of our
life? How can we place our life in relation to all life?
Put simply, how do we plan on relating to each other and the
world around us?
As you recall, I made a social contract with you earlier in
this book that I’m not gonna just ask a bunch of questions and
stay philosophical. I’m here to lay solutions as well – right now,
I’m going to try to break down an offer of seven elements that can
make up a design frame for a relational economy.
89Hoodie Economics
Those seven elements are as follows:
1. See through a systemic lens – everything is in relation
2. Activate imagination
3. Emergence as an impact tool and area of investment
4. Value shared knowledge, not secret knowledge
5. Centre nature and design with, from and in relation to nature
6. Network with unlikely connections, specifically UNC×5 – unite
the network with a goal of social good
7. Give-give, receive-receive – energy, knowledge, time,
opportunities
90
Relations
These seven principles and processes have been grounded in
real-life experiences, and through this section I’ll share anecdotal
evidence to help inform the logic thread. I’m going to provide
case studies, actionable maps and pathways. It’s going to be a big
chapter, and there may be times when I speed up the narrative
to help keep us in movement. I’ll write like the painting for this
chapter, with time-space leaps that are critical to get into the
reality of relations.
But before we jump further into this, let’s answer the money
question up front, one of the favourite questions of our time: how
do you pay for it, for a relational economy?
To answer that, let’s examine the intersecting tectonic plates
shifting in our economy.
First, as we know, automation is munching up jobs. Soon
driverless trucks will replace truck drivers. Tech assistants are
replacing human assistants. Online shopping is eliminating the
huge sector of retail jobs. Computerisation is encroaching on the
creative realms: film sets can now be entirely virtual, replacing
the artists, set designers, carpenters, electricians and painters
that traditionally built those worlds. Graphic design – one of the
refuges for visual artists to gain employment – is being eaten
by templates and powered design tools running on artificial
intelligence (AI), which has even been used to generate data-
driven journalism. Online classes are replacing schools and
universities. The list could go on.
The robots are here, and they are taking our jobs. Rapidly. As
mentioned earlier, almost half the jobs that exist now will be gone
within two decades.
With fewer jobs, what is the future? Will it be a future of mass
unemployment? How will we live? How will we eat? Have homes?
9192
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
Universal basic income is one pathway – tax the robot
companies that munched up the jobs, and make the robots provide
us with a living wage. Then our life is not live to work, but live to
learn, to relate, to know, and to be.
How will exchanges happen in this new world? In relations with
each other and most importantly with nature.
Relational economies connect us to each other and to
nature, and in such an economy we maintain our status as a
custodial species. They maintain our ability to transfer energy and
knowledge within our species and other species. They tap us into
the longest-running intelligence systems we have had as species.
When we are in relation, we can then deeply craft story – story is
how we communicate and pass on complex knowledge. You can
tell deep long story over 60,000+ years, in the songlines mapped
into nature. When your bass note is 60,000 years’ long and you
are thinking into the future, the song you sing can touch the stars.
Knowledge gained, knowledge shared, one long song. The robots
need us to imagine, to sing, to talk to nature, as only we can.
That’s why universal basic income can work. Think about it:
mass unemployment is not an option for capitalism. UBI is no
longer merely a theory: it has been tried, on larger and smaller
scales, on four continents (not mine), in developed, developing
and undeveloped economies, for decades now. The revolution
has begun.
Models that value this exchange relation work. Give-give.
Receive-receive. Moving to an economy and a mindset that value
exchanges of energy, knowledge, time and empathy will free us
from a model of debt. A world of increased value will emerge;
limitless growth will be a thing of the past.Another tectonic plate moving is the location of our work. For
so long it was the field, then the factory, then the office – but now,
it is moving to our home. High-speed internet enabled this; the
COVID pandemic accelerated it, all over the planet.
This has consequences: for many in the here and now, a
short-term sense of better work/life balance, with more time,
thanks to eliminating the commute. But we are in fact losing
our life/world balance, by giving up on our time outside our
immediate orbit, and the effect is that we are eroding our
workplace relational footprints. What we so easily forget is that
our responsibility is not to our direct family alone. It’s to those
we share the Earth with. When we make our relational footprint
smaller, we decrease the chance of unlikely connections and
movement and network flow. We stop churning the water.
The ease of today is also a portal to irrelevance tomorrow.
Once work is remote, there is no limit on how remote it can be.
Remote working is not limited to cities or nation states. One of
the other eight billion people in the world could do your job, and
perhaps for less pay.
Being in relation to where we work matters. Ford lifts Detroit
because people live there, they send their kids to the schools,
volunteer, love, laugh, bump into a Berry Gordy and help finance
Motown records. Work creates a community.
This moment of the runaway office train, like automation, is
not a path to doom, but in fact accelerates our chance to return to
relations. From my perspective, the only way for the office to have
deep value today and tomorrow is by recirculating energy.
Imagine offices being refurbished so that one of their new
functions is being homes for the homeless. Employees once a
93Hoodie Economics
week make the beds and run the kitchen. All of a sudden you’ve
got relevance and relational value. You’ve got roots.
Add in more relational connects, some to human and non-
human entities, and your organisation and life as an employee
starts to be rich in its relational strength. For example, the
employees mentor at a local high school once a week. There is
a kindness economy gathering at work once a week to stimulate
kindness locally and globally. Joy is measured on the balance
sheet. Relations with nature is a personal target for each employee
and the organisation at large. Weave those connections into the
homeless service and now you’ve got a reason to go to work and
a value for the organisation now and during the age of robots.
And the offset is kids see their parents in the world, and they have
memories and stories and feelings and sounds and smells carried
from the world to their home, and that’s the role of a parent, to
role-model life, not just to be in service to mini lords, and not just
to show the kids how to sit in the bedroom with no pants on,
talking to thumbnails.
That’s how we pay for it – we shift our attention and then the
value moves. This may be the peak moment before the system
eats itself and we re-emerge suddenly with space and time again.
We are in the space in between.
With that, now let’s dive one by one into the seven elements to
shape a relational economy.
94
Relations
1. See through a systemic lens – everything is in relation
In the time it takes you to read this paragraph, 10,000 muons – tiny
particles, a bit like electrons – have passed through your body.
The time-space continuum, constant flows of energy, constant
movement – that’s reality.
Let’s look at the whole chessboard, and at everything past
and beyond the board, zoom out from where you are, holding this
book now, and look at the world through an eagle’s eye. Zoom out
further and look back through the vapour particles in the cloud –
feel their energy. Keep going through the stratosphere and out
into space, among the planets. And while you’re out there, just
remember, all the stars, planets, and galaxies that we know of
today make up just four per cent of the known universe, the other
ninety-six per cent is made of stuff astronomers can’t see, detect
or understand, the so-called dark matter and dark energy.
When I look at the whole world, the whole universe, I see
the image I painted for this chapter, spirals of energy spinning
constantly, with space, endless space in between. There are
pathways everywhere, layers everywhere, journeys everywhere:
intersections and relations.
A mathematical visualisation and interpretation of this constant
zoom out–zoom in loop can be found in the Mandelbrot set, the
work of mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, born in Poland in 1924.
Mandelbrot survived World War II in France, before migrating to
the US, where he studied mathematics and aeronautics, then
went to work at IBM in 1958. He was at IBM for thirty-five years
and would take periodic leave to teach economics and applied
sciences at Harvard University. Among his achievements, he
95Hoodie EconomicsRelations
coined the term ‘fractal’; he saw the reality of the roughness of
nature, the chaotic movement of life, and worked to map it.
With access to some of the earliest computers, Mandelbrot
became one of the first to use computer graphics to map
geometry, which led him to discover the Mandelbrot set. Check out
the Mandelbrot Zoom on the net – it shows the mapping of the
Mandelbrot set, demonstrating how visual complexity can be
created from simple rules. One of Mandelbrot’s core messages was
that life is complex, and we don’t yet have the mapping systems to
honour this complexity. In The Fractal Geometry of Nature in 1982
he says, ‘Why is geometry often described as “cold” and “dry”?
One reason lies in its inability to describe the shape of a cloud, a
mountain, a coastline, or a tree. Clouds are not spheres, mountains
are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth,
nor does lightning travel in a straight line.’
When analysing financial markets through a fractal systemic
lens in his 2004 book The (Mis)Behavior of Markets, Mandelbrot
writes:Companies and stock prices, trade flows and currency rates, crop
yields and commodity futures – all are inter-related to one degree
or another, in ways we have barely begun to understand. In such a
world, it is common sense that events in the distant past continue
to echo in the present.
No one is alone in this world. No act is without consequences for
others. It is a tenet of chaos theory that, in dynamical systems,
the outcome of any process is sensitive to its starting point –
or, in the famous cliche, the flap of a butterfly’s wings in the
Amazon can cause a tornado in Texas. I do not assert markets
are chaotic, though my fractal geometry is one of the primary
mathematical tools of “chaology.” But clearly, the global economy
is an unfathomably complicated machine. To all the complexity
of the physical world of weather, crops, ores, and factories, you
add the psychological complexity of men acting on their fleeting
expectations of what may or may not happen – sheer phantasms.

From Mandelbrot to another big thinker of the 2oth century,
let’s open the pages of David Graeber, whose book Debt: The First
5,000 Years peels back the layers of thinking that created our
modern relations.
Graeber describes how we’ve inherited a view that life is a debt,
to those before us, to the nation states, to our education providers,
to gods, to our parents. It’s such a sad, startling realisation that so
many people spend their life feeling like they have to be paying
back their existence, that their first and fundamental relation to
life is that they are in debt. The second striking current that ran
from Graeber’s words into my soul was how the marketplace has
encouraged and promoted and insisted upon our individuality –
sidelining, downplaying and excluding our relations to each other.
The third realisation is that the creation of the modern nation state
put borders between us all, created debtor relations to the state,
and barriers to relations across borders.
Graeber writes in Debt: The First 5,000 Years:
You are free from your debt to your ancestors when you become
an ancestor; you are free from your debts to the sages when
you become a sage, you are free from your debt to humanity
when you act with humanity. All the more so if one is speaking to
the universe. If you cannot bargain with the gods because they
already have everything, then you certainly cannot bargain with
97Hoodie EconomicsRelations
the universe, because the universe is everything. One could in
fact interpret this as a subtle way of saying that the only way of
“freeing oneself” from the debt was not literally repaying debts,
but rather showing that these debts do not exist because one is
not in fact separate to begin with, and hence that the very notion
of cancelling the debt and achieving a separate autonomous
existence was ridiculous from the start. Or even that the very
presumption of positioning oneself as separate from humanity
to the cosmos, so much so that one can enter into one-to-one
dealings with it, is itself the crime that can only be answered by
death. Our guilt is not due to the fact that we cannot repay our
debt to the universe. Our guilt is the presumption in thinking of
ourselves as being in any sense equivalent to Everything Else that
Exists, or Has Ever Existed, so as to be able to conceive of such a
debt in the first place.all humans, from the humblest worker to the mightiest billionaire.
It goes for all human societies too, be they kingdoms, nation states
or online economies.
It should be self-evident that we are simply custodians of the
light of life, mentors that have the tools and then pass them on.
Instead we gather our knowledge, we hide it, we protect it like
Tolkien’s Gollum protects his ring, in the shadows in the cave,
more primitive in our thinking and understanding of life than any
generation before us. Living out of balance like that makes us
sick. It is because we have inherited and accepted a fundamental
lie: that we are individual and separate. We are not. We are all
in relation.
When you take the large view, the long view, the biggest
possible zoom out, and you see eight billion people alongside
twenty billion billion animals (estimated by mathematician
Brian Tomasik, 20,000,121,091,000,000,000 to be precise), issues
such as Indigenous inequity dissolve into much bigger questions.
Inequity is systemic, it transcends nations. It transcends
governments, whose three- or four-year cycles barely touch the
surface of time.
All life is in relations, now, before and after, and to have
a chance to relate to each other effectively, we’ve got to do
it systemically in our design, our approach, our actions, and
understand the flow of our energy, a flow that began aeons ago
and will continue for just as long.
We are not separate and therefore don’t have to compare
ourselves to everything that has existed. We are a tiny, tiny, tiny
part of everything. We are so tiny in relation to everything, both
now, before and after, that the design of any economic model
without this deep fact of life as a foundation is going to be
insufficient and incommensurate, as are our current models.
Fundamentally, we are deep knowledge holders, companions
of the fire; we carry a flicker along the way and through story we
keep life alight, we weave with our energy, their energy, all energy.
Our role as humans is to be a custodian, a guide, a mentor: to
accept the knowledge, the work that came before us, the evolution
in our DNA, the creation of life as it is, the aeons of collective
human effort, the billions of years of Earth’s effort, to sustain,
build, grow, foster and fill life with magnificent joy. That goes for

2. Activate imagination
An active imagination is the key to get into a relational economy
house. To demonstrate this, bear with me as I tell the story of how
AIME went from being a contained scaffolding propping up sick
systems, to a network with a systemic relational mapping pattern,
with an objective to do ourselves out of a job for the health of the
system at large.
Let’s start with a love story.
In August 2016, I stood on a stage at Chelsea Piers in New York
City to launch AIME globally and shared our vision for a healthier
world. I was joined on the stage by actor Yael Stone, who went
to the same primary school as me in Balmain, Sydney, and
together we sang ‘From Little Things Big Things Grow’. The tune,
by Kev Carmody and Paul Kelly, chronicles the longest strike in
Australian history, when Vincent Lingiari and his Gurinji people
walked off a Northern Territory cattle station where he and his
people were working for rations. They stopped working and said,
‘We want our land back.’ And sat, and waited. It culminated nine
years later with Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pouring a handful
of sand through Lingiari’s fingers – a battle for pay had lit the
fire of the land rights movement. And the song has since fuelled
many, including me and AIME, showing the long power of story.
Knowledge captured. Knowledge shared.
As Yael and I stood on that stage, singing this big song, calling
in the ancestors’ energy, sharing a message of potential and love
for the world, in the process, as the greatest personal gift I’ve
received from the AIME mission, Yael and I were falling in love. Yael
helped make the global launch a reality, and when I looked to her I
could see in her eyes that she thought we could change the world.
100
Relations
Love with Yael gave me a sense of home, and eventually
I learned to love myself, to unwind the competitive self-hate
motivation inherited from a life of elite sport, and to find my way to
a kinder relation to my body, to me. Together we danced through
life, and have since made two magical children.
Love is the greatest fuel on Earth. Also not yet measured on the
stock exchange.
From 2016 on that stage to the peak of our efforts to ‘go
global’, let’s head to 2019. To make a splash and cut through
in the US you had to go big – so we chartered a Boeing to fly
from the US to Australia, carrying people from all different races
and cultures, from African American people, to Native Americans,
LGBTQI+ people, refugees, ostracised religious outcasts; it was
a wide church of those from outside the margins. In Australia
they would meet the AIME crew and those we were working with
from Africa for the world’s first festival of mentoring, melding a
melting pot from outside the margins. What could possibly go
wrong? Everything.
I was hosting a lot of the festival – and on the first morning I
hit the wall. I collapsed. I had to be taken home. I couldn’t move.
Remember what I said about limits?
Most of that program was in my head, I knew the script and
had visualised it, but without me there, the train ran off the rails,
straight into that vacuum that the train heads into in the map
image for this chapter. Before I collapsed, I completed a couple
of sessions with the group and I know where I got it so wrong
and started the sparks that would unravel the event. As part of
the opening session, introducing AIME to the group, I shared a
slide which said: ‘The AIME soul is from the heart of blackness,
101102
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
synonymous with the struggle.’ That was where I failed in the
framing process.
As I lay on my back bedridden, the festival unravelled from
the structured program, from being about how we could mentor
together, to being about who had the right to speak on behalf
of struggle. The festival moved into a deep exploration into the
language of struggle and separation. It became about individual
identity and differences – who was more black. It became the
disadvantage Olympics. Some of the festival mentors from the
US began to challenge our Indigenous Australian crew as to
whether we were actually black. Some of our African American
guests were so focused on the view through their lens, on their
struggle, that they couldn’t find their way to understanding
the struggle of Indigenous people in Australia, who had also
faced slavery, murder, dispossession and genocide. Our guests
from Africa added another layer to the story when they raised
more than an eyebrow to the challenges from some of the
US contingent on who was black enough. The final mixer was
that many of our US guests from other groups were excluded
from the black/white dialogue.
It’s hard to come up for breath after ages being held under
water, being unseen and unheard, having no voice or worth. When
you finally get a small window, you wanna speak. There’s just so
many people who have suffered that there isn’t enough space for
all the intelligence that is emerging from the shadows – and that’s
why we need different networks to make space. To make space
for patterning that can allow this intelligence pushed so far under
to emerge.
The problem with Indigenous inequity isn’t the intelligence
of our Indigenous brothers and sisters. The problem is a lack ofeconomic and social mobility – a lack of network. Your outcome
depends on other people in your network. If you are in a lower
socioeconomic class, having contacts in better-off classes
improves your chances of improving your lot, research has proven
over and over again. That effect is pervasive, even leading to
healthier and longer lives. Hence our emphasis on mentoring,
linking outside to inside.
As the festival unravelled, I was just around the corner at
home. My body had shut down. Over the course of the three
days I’d receive daily reports on the trauma that was opening up
in the mix-up of trying to understand each other. And my heart
was shattered.
On the final day, I got out of bed to talk to the mentors and try
to help everyone come back together. Fighting back tears, I said,
‘I was sad that some of you have not taken more time to listen and
learn in another country, to find space for each other’s stories to
shine through.’ They shared with me that they felt like they hadn’t
been put to work effectively enough, that I’d wasted all their
talents and skills, that there was too much control in the AIME
model, that the facilitators couldn’t manage an experience like this,
that I’d gone MIA.
And they were right. I had to recognise the areas we could
improve. I tried my best to answer all the questions, to feel the
anger and pain.
After answering the last question, my body started to shake,
and I collapsed. Kabir (that friend from university who helped
start AIME) caught me. An ambulance arrived, I got taken out in a
wheelchair. Mum called Yael, who then packed up our New York
apartment and brought our daughter home. The festival finished,
our guests from overseas returned home, AIME was shattered.

I sat in hospital with a drip going in, and the hope flooding out.
I was meant to bring people together, not to divide us.
I had, for the first time in my life, lost hope. Hope in our
potential, our kindness, our relations. Hope in each other.
For three months I sat with a cloud of depression. I felt guilty.
I felt like I failed everyone. I felt let down by some. I felt ashamed.
I didn’t know how to go back to AIME, where to find the energy.
My first step out was to own my mistakes. If I knew then
what I know now about emergence and network design, on day
one I would have broken everyone in the festival into unlikely
connections of groups of five (UNC×5 – more to come on this
very soon). I would have got rid of the stage, and set some
themes, then let the relations deepen and emerge. I would have
focused on us making something together, a story, not trying to
lecture up the front. I failed by accepting that the frame of festival
means a stage and a host who stands up the front. We wanted
to get it right, so we tightened the controls. The desperation
for control and outcomes leads us to subtle design flaws that
undercut all of our ability to form healthy relations.
This moment taught me that how we enter a relationship is so
important. If we enter with identity as our ticket, then we are only
ever going to see our differences. But life is not black and white.
If we can enter with imagination as the ticket, then we have found
ourselves in a space where we can become unstuck and see
deeper beyond the surface into each other’s minds and souls and
beings. I was starting to feel the pull towards a different way of
designing and thinking.
Three months later, with shame still in my heart, to return to
work, I composed myself, and composed a letter for the AIME
team. I reflected on the words of F Scott Fitzgerald: ‘The test of afirst-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in
mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.’
I could have hope, and know its fragility.
Life is complex and simple.
Everything I believe in can be wrong.
And it’s all one song, each piece of knowledge, adds to the
next, it becomes richer if you are open to hearing it, and to
saying the words ‘I don’t know’. The all-knowing being is not in
relation, the expert is isolated, the wisdom lies in always being
able to have movement in your thinking, to always be able to
have space for the idea to grow.
I was uncovering deeper complexity.
In 2018 I interviewed Australian musician John Butler for our
mentoring TV show and he said, as his final message to the kids,
‘If you’re not willing to work, don’t bother dreaming.’ I thought
that was straight gospel. Meaning of life stuff. And I mentioned it
to Kabir, who said: ‘That’s bullshit. For many kids in the north of
Kenya in refugee camps, the only thing they have is their dreaming,
their imagination is their only place where they can be truly free,
no matter how hard they work.’ And then I thought that was
gospel. Two ideas, both brilliantly true, but both contradicting
one another. For dreams to come to life they take a lot of work,
effort and persistence. Seperate and related, imagination was the
freedom – the freedom of the mind. The imagination can never be
chained, the mind can always be free. And in the worst of life’s lot,
we can imagine. And we can, in many cases, put that imagination
into action.
The rest of Fitzgerald’s quote goes like this: ‘One should, for
example, be able to see that things are hopeless yet be determined
to make them otherwise.’ Yep, exactly.
105106
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
The most important lesson for me from this experience was
that imagination – the imagination that we have to use when
navigating two true but opposing ideas – frees us. It frees us from
the limitations of identity. It allows us to listen to the knowledge
on the other side of the bridge. An activated imagination suspends
judgement and powers empathy, which helps us find pathways to
understand others.
We are funny creatures – our confirmation bias drives us
towards affirming what we have already learned, and we reject
the new. I think it’s why it’s so hard to say ‘I’m wrong’, even though
saying it is often the necessary first step to break through. ‘I’m
wrong’ can lead to: ‘Wow, look what I just learned.’
When encountering the new, there is an obligation to make
the leap across to understand it. Which was one of the impressive
things about the Black Lives Matter movement – it encouraged
that leap of understanding, inviting others to read the vast
accumulated literature on what it means to be black, to actually
do the thinking, rather than yet again demanding black people to
explain and recount their experiences.
That generosity can feel challenging for those totally
unconnected to the world of black and brown people, because
it says to the Princeton business school stock exchange guru,
‘Hey, maybe you don’t know everything – take a moment to pause,
listen deeply, and try to learn from my point of view, because
I’ve been listening to your point of view and the point of view of
people like you for hundreds of years.’ And that’s hard, because the
Princeton cat has been trained to be all knowing, and to value their
knowledge system but not others.
This opportunity to learn has been offered in spite of how
mainstream social structures have set out to crush, to belittle, torob, and dismiss other knowledge systems, other experiences.
The inherent bias against those outside the margins is something
I have lived. Why, for example, would a senior Australian official
based in New York, with a job to support Australians to take on
the world, have made an effort to send me an email after AIME
went global in 2016 saying: stick to your knitting, what you’re
good at is working with the Aborigines, don’t try to change the
world, you’ll only end up disappointed. Would he have said that
to a mainstream person from Australia scaling up their coffee
business or fashion line?
We are emerging into a phase where we can all sit at the
table. Now we have to work out how to communicate, and that
is challenging, because the biggest untapped resource of human
intelligence has yet to be touched, and that’s the intelligence
outside the margins.
I’ve learned imagination is one of our superpowers. It’s the
beginning of every action, of every idea, of everything we do and
everything we are. Imagination is the key to changing paradigms,
shifting mindsets and unlocking this mysterious door of empathy
that can take us into new corridors of design to see, feel and
then create other ways of being.
One more story. On Friday 23 February 2018 I had one of
the most significant speaking gigs of my life, in Pretoria, to a
predominantly black university student audience. We were in
South Africa to launch AIME there with our first global partner,
the University of Pretoria. Just around the corner in Soweto is
a house where Nelson Mandela once lived; we visited it before
the event. Mandela is one of my heroes because of his ability
to see all people as people. Despite the pain and harm inflicted
upon him and so many by his country’s white rulers, Mandela
107108
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
was able to forgive and to look forward, to see a vision of a
‘rainbow nation’.
As I thought about rainbows, and looked at Mandela’s house
in the sunshine in Soweto, I thought across the seas to Jim Henson,
the American puppeteer and filmmaker who created The Muppets
and the song sung by Kermit, ‘Rainbow Connection’ – one of the
most important love letters to imagination ever written. I sat
there with Kermit singing in my mind, imagining Mandela moving
through the world, then tried to imagine myself into the speech
the following day.
I was hyper aware that the moment I stood up everyone
would think ‘white guy’. I’ve been here before: how to explain my
Aboriginality quicker than the way the semiotic process works
in the brain to link an image to a word. How quickly could I build
the bridge that acknowledged the opportunities I have been
afforded having fair skin, and also state the fact I have black
family, my grandfather faced apartheid conditions, most of my
family were massacred. There were two survivors, one of them
Pemau, my great-great-great-grandmother, who our daughter is
named after.
I didn’t have the time in that speech (or here in this book) to
walk through all of Australian history, of how Aboriginal people
were removed from our families with the explicit intention to
assimilate us into white families and within a few generations to
‘breed out the black’. But I managed to thread that needle, and
then get into the ideas on how we could work together. I hope I
did Nelson, Jim and little Kermit proud as we channelled the power
and freedom in the rainbow.
And that’s it: the rainbow makes us look up and see the skies,
it maps us to the universe. And the rainbow is where imaginationflourishes – the rainbow is where the knowledge and the ideas
are. The rainbow is not black or white. Neither are you. Life is
black and white, and all colours of the rainbow. Our magic, our
wonder, our genius emerges in its deepest form only when we are
forced to adapt, when obstacles block our path. In these moments,
where huge progress is possible and consistently reveals itself, we
must put our plans aside, use our imagination, and jump without a
parachute, knowing we’ll land in a seat on a runaway rainbow train
express to a joyful future.
3. Emergence as an impact tool and area of investment
I believe the most obvious thought of all, which is to say the
simplest, is that life is complex: everything is interconnected, it all
has value. When you zoom out and contemplate us living on a rock
spinning at 1000 miles per hour, hard to disagree, no? How do we
make sense of the frightening complexity?
Emergent design gives us at the very least the chance to
hang on to the threads of it all, to feel the energy currents moving
us inevitably to tomorrow. Yet we don’t have impact systems
that value this thinking in business, government, corporate or
philanthropic reporting frames. So we just ceteris paribus and shut
it all out.
Instead, let’s dig into how we measure value. Inequality will not
move until we can find impact measurement systems that unlock
109110
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
the worth of relations and knowledge exchange, while resisting the
urge to attribute monetary worth to that exchange.
Emergent design is natural design, synched with a recognition
that human beings do not control Earth, that we are elements in
a much larger, much more powerful system. In emergent design,
systems have adaptability, and systems thinking allows us to
consider our place in a much larger framework.
As Tyson Yunkaporta explains in Sand Talk, the value of
Indigenous systems thinking is relational, and the measurement
is the health of our existence, of the animals, the Earth, and
each other. The collective health, now, before, beyond. For
example, Indigenous fire management systems flow with the
land, not swinging in for one big burn, one big audit, one end-of-
financial-year run-off. Little by little. Always connected. Always
moving. Always changing. Always in relation. Always adapting to
conditions, which is a principal element of emergent design.
AIME is currently working with Ethic and Tyson and Deakin
University’s Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab on a Nature
Fund design. Exploring questions like: what does it look like to
deeply value Botswana’s Okavango Delta, for its total health
and wealth, beyond the value of its oil deposits? For example,
the Okavango Delta, if fracked, would release a mind-boggling
amount of carbon into the atmosphere. We are working on how
to find different economic levers to value the intelligence in
nature to prevent this fracking and others like it from having the
value it currently has, so that the intelligence of nature will be
more valuable to an investor.
Can we, for another example, anchor our financial tools and the
measurement of an organisation’s success in relation to keystone
species in each region? We’ve been digging into a concept ofcultural indicator species, exploring ‘platypus finance’ as a frame
to think through the intelligence of the platypus into financial
design. More recently we’ve been firming on twelve cultural
indicator species that could be measured and tracked to value
life in complex systemic health. Many of the lab’s yarns have been
published on Tyson’s podcast ‘The Other Others’.
We gotta find different measurement systems. We are limiting
our potential by limiting what we measure – particularly how we
measure success, in our own lives, and in our organisations.
One of the reasons tactically that AIME is working so deeply
in New York is that so much of our organisational design springs
from ‘the market’. There have been constant admonitions over
the past two decades that governments or social organisations
should be run like a business – but business is looking to the
market, and the market isn’t anchored in nature, it’s unnatural.
Our governments and social organisations are there to serve –
businesses aren’t.
What happens in business is competition, not community,
not cooperation. It’s politics and power, not purpose. It’s a game,
a game played with stuff and things. It is not a model for life.
Competition, the matter of defeating your rivals, of extracting
maximum profit from people and resources, is no model. In the
limited-growth lane of purpose work, it ain’t a game, it’s life. It’s life
to be in service, it’s life to be in relation.
With not-for-profits, the leadership of the social organisation –
who has often spent a lifetime in the social change space – reports
to the board of directors – often made up of those who have
succeeded in financial-driven systems that have caused harm
that the social change organisation is trying to fix. It’s a whacky
loop. Again, the wrong intelligence is being valued; the intelligence
111112
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
of those effecting social change does not get them a seat on
the board.
If we valued relations and Indigenous systems thinking, then
the chairperson of the board of directors could be someone
without a degree. Without a career. Who has access to lifetimes
of knowledge from outside the margins. Yet we rush for the
lawyer or the banker, who we tag as ‘responsible people’ and who
then bask in their network power and ability to attract capital to
promote growth.
But not-for-profit work is being done for its own inherent
value, not to attract capital. We do it because it needs to be
done. We need homes for people. We need clean water. We need
sanitation, education, care for our old people and child care for
the betterment of all of us. Currently all roads lead back to the
bank to translate our worth, including not-for-profits. It doesn’t
make sense.
Sure, these bodies need an audit and risk committee and
an audit once a year – but they also need a joy report once
a year, and many aunty and uncle yarns. And I think we need
rotational chairpeople, and public board meetings – that would
change things.
Let’s consider the origins of the thinking that drives the frames
of governance in the non-profit sector. The responsibility of
keeping the organisation solvent – not going bankrupt – falls on
the directors. That system was developed to ensure that creditors
couldn’t sue shareholders for debt. But when so much of the
board’s time is focused on audit and risk and finance, and the
major institutional focus is on not going bankrupt, then we have
some pretty serious capital influences driving the thinking in our
social change interventions.Audits – which essentially assess where an organisation
is at – have been around since the Greeks and Romans. Fine
and necessary, but I just wonder if we have designed the right
questions and tools for our audits. Indigenous systems thinking
sees us auditing the world – that is, assessing where we are
at – through relations, through connections, and weaving that
energy through story to learn and improve our way of life.
The focus on financial capital is the central flow of so many
of our social structures. What I’m arguing for is making space at
the board table for analysis to come from both a financial capital
frame and from other systems of intelligence.
One of the obstacles I’ve found myself banging into along the
last twenty years has been the serious dismissal of complexity
in traditional business contexts. I’m often laughed at for always
reinventing our organisation, for always having new ideas. New is
the enemy of the desire to control and repeat. Someone actually
said to me once, ‘Maybe we should put a cap on new ideas and
limit them.’ Umm no, we need all the ideas we can get. We ain’t
machines – ideas are our species’ lifeblood.
It’s taken a global pandemic to lift the curtain on
the pantomime: humans don’t control life. Life is unruly,
unpredictable, alive, regenerative and complex. Those who
‘have ideas’ are simply tuned in to this reality. The desire to claim
control of life will destroy us. There are significant global changes
afoot that are shaping the next century. NFTs (non-fungible
tokens, such as one-off digital artworks) and cryptocurrencies
are offering alternative economic models that are decentralised
and wild. They threaten to pile disruption on top of disruption
(technological change, climate disaster, whole job sectors
disappearing rapidly). In this context, if your social change
113114
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
organisation (or any organisation) is not fast, agile, regenerative,
adaptive, and full of idea generation, it may as well be dead
and buried.
This leads me to the network, which made us what we are as a
species, via our powers of communication. The internet has made
clear the natural reality that we are all interlinked. If your societal
change model isn’t exploring the power and agency of your own
network, you are missing a trick. If your work is not interlinked
beyond your immediate laneway, look out. And I don’t mean just
paying Zuckerberg for an ad, I mean understanding your place in
the natural network of the world.
We need to find more measurement systems to value
interconnection, and rewards for working with complexity, to
nudge organisations to think and move in these ways. I’m obsessed
by the worth of the node in the network, the value of that
connection, and am desperate to develop research to analyse the
worth of a connection through a relational frame. I’m hoping that
this book can – among other things – light some sparks in that
space for others to go and fan the flames.
In the process of building out AIME’s most recent impact
strategy, I was wrestling with our board and other key impact
players around this very challenge of what and how we measure.
Along the way we spent time with Adam Davids, a brilliant
Fulbright scholar and proud Indigenous Australian. Adam was
thinking through the network approach and how to measure
relational value. After spending time in conversation with mentors
of AIME, he looked beyond the interactions between the groups of
mentors and mentees to what was happening between the
mentors in their relational strength. First he said the connection
was so much richer than what you’d see in a Harry Potter fan clubon campus because these uni students had seen each other give
giving their time. He then went on to compare to the relationship
between Facebook friends, and wondered how you could shape
a tool of analysis to measure the strength of relation. Maybe it’s
‘would you cross the road to say hello to one of your connections
on Facebook’, and ninety per cent answer no. Let’s say ninety
per cent would cross the road to see a fellow AIME mentor.
When you take the score of ten per cent and ninety per cent and
then multiply it with the network’s audience, we start to have a
deeper measurement around engagement, which isn’t about time
addicted to the platform but how strong our relations are in the
platform, when translated to how we live out our lives outside
the internet. Now that starts to scratch the surface of relational
wealth – not just audience size, but health and wealth of relations.
Smaller networks with deeper relations start to be as valuable, if
not more valuable, than the mass networked audience platforms
with very weak relational health.
If you can’t find your imaginative way into systems thinking or into
an understanding of networks, then you are missing one of the
main games of the 21st century: virtual worlds. Long a dream of
web designers in the internet, these are spaces to create parallel
115116

nations, playgrounds, arenas for human connection, which can in
their best intentional design frames build more equitable and joyful
nodes and pathways to each other.
Virtual worlds have been around since the 1960s – Ivan
Sutherland and Bob Sproull created the first one, ‘The Sword of
Damocles’, in 1968, then more came in the 1970s with multi-user
games. We’ve played in virtual worlds in arcade stores since the
90s, and we’ve been in chat rooms since early internet days. Social
networks have found ways to monetise relations in networks, and
the meta playgrounds are now being designed in ways to look at
how to anchor their own economic value system – peer to peer –
which is where NFTs and digital coins start to arise.
Try not to turn away at this moment – it hurts my brain too,
working through these new concepts. But if it hurts my brain, then
I know it’s important. Growth is in the struggle.
Primatologist Dr Jane Goodall once shared her view with me,
that Earth is so interconnected that every intervention must have
the biggest possible systems view before it’s even attempted.
So much of our life in network design is limited, reduced to states
and borders, to postcodes and titles, and the most heartbreaking
piece is the modern social network, which has the potential of
the biggest possible view, of a world interconnected. We had the
chance to harness this for knowledge, growth, and to work in
a lens of planetism that Dr Goodall urged me to. Instead we’ve
managed to glorify the power of social networks which have taken
the systems of human interaction that have been around since
human life began, then used knowledge of our connections to
make us playthings in a cage for the advertisers.
When I look at these sickening advertising networks parading
as social connectors, I see division and pain being amplified, I seeno anchors to social good, no roots in nature, no deep relations,
no encouragement for listening deeply. I see the glaring missing
space for deep relational networks – without advertising or data
as the business model or revenue driver. That’s the network we are
trying to rebuild at AIME – the natural network of human beings
as custodial species, all in relation to time, nature and each other,
which is evolving into a digital nation, IMAGI-NATION (see next
chapter). I deeply hope our legacy is to leave behind an impact
language that can value this model of networking with the same
value as any financially valued network in the world. To value the
lens on the planet as a whole.
I was asked once on a business podcast, ‘What was the
inspiration behind creating AIME?’ They were looking for the
hero moment, the flash of vision. But it was much more humble
than that. After looking around and thinking about our world and
our different paths, I did the most natural thing perhaps any of us
would do if we weren’t all so distracted: I took some of my time
and went and hung out with some kids, to share some stuff I’d
learned and ... just hang out.
Mentoring is very close to the most natural human relational
connection outside of the family unit. A connection where
knowledge is shared. In Indigenous knowledge systems in my
country we have what feels like thousands of aunties, uncles,
nephews, nieces and cousins – we find our commonality, we find
our anchor points, we realise that our strength is in our relations.
These aunties and uncles are not blood-related; they are older
people, worth listening to. In starting AIME, I didn’t do anything
but listen to what has occurred in our relation systems since
we’ve been human.
Communicate, share, relate.

The aunty/uncle\nephew/cousin relational model is one of
the best designs from Indigenous relational patterns. It moves
in these shapes: /\. It’s not in the | shape. The movement has
flow. Think about your relations with aunties and uncles – often
there’s less of the direct instruction, more freedom, less hierarchy,
more space to play. Parents are left to feel like the instructor and
disciplinarians, but the reality is that parents can be both | and /\.
We all have aunty/uncle\nephew/niece energy, we just don’t often
build the patterns into how we relate as parents or employers
or workers or managers. Although why do we need adults to be
managed by other adults? When we go aunty/uncle\nephew/
niece we can shift positions in our meetings, in our encounters,
in our relation, with one of us being niece mindset for a time and
then becoming the aunty mindset and vice-versa, see-sawing,
always weaving and moving, diagonal energy, not forcing power or
authority straight up and down. It modulates and reverses. It flows.
Not only should we relate more aunty/uncle\nephew/niece
with each other, we should also work with more complexity with
time and space.
We should see at least five ways: /\\/–. Backwards diagonally
to beneath the earth where we’ve come from, diagonal back and
up to see the ancestors in the stars and spirits moving with us, ‘the
old people’ as my mum calls them, to think about the intelligence
we’ve left behind. Diagonal down our lens turns to our next step,
to the life emerging on the ground in front of our footsteps, then
we look up to the sky in front of us and the birds flying, and the
universe beyond, and finally, we look ahead to the horizon, ready
to move. Knowledge is everywhere all the time.
Do this and you’re on your way to thinking with a systems
thinking lens, harnessing complexity and rich intelligent processes.Recently at the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab, we –
that’s Dr John Davis, specialising in Indigenous languages;
Dr Chels Marshall, expert in Indigenous marine management;
Dr in waiting Josh Waters, whose field is Indigenous knowledge
systems; plus Tyson and me – were yarning about networks, riffing
on how networked Indigenous systems are and how we freely
share and receive knowledge from Earth. The conversation rolled
into the intelligence of having relations to the land, and to star
systems, and to animals in totemic connection and songlines and
story, and how these multiple highways of exchange ensured that
knowledge could be stored. We’ve built some form of metaverse
already, relating and linking and sharing knowledge in and with the
stones and riverways, the nuts and the soil.
We lightheartedly reflected how Indigenous people would
always win the war on colonisation because we invented
libraries long ago, storing the knowledge in star systems, in
riverways and songlines, in our ancestors singing from the trees
and swimming through the rivers, in the ground where we will
return. We did this by being in relation; we give of our life, and
when we give and don’t expect anything in return, that’s when
we are at our richest. Chels Marshall rounded it off by saying,
‘We invented the f*#king Cloud.’
As our most intelligent and longest-surviving systems show
us, the healthy rich road is networked. I feel so lucky to be a part
of the network of Indigenous Australians, mapped, in relation.
And it’s why this and other long systems knowledge from across
the Earth, with strong anchors, must be at the front of the design
queue of our digital networks, our financial network design, our
impact design, because we’ve already done it, for heaps long – hey,
put us in the game coach!

I love the way Charles Eisenstein puts it in Sacred Economics:
‘Each organism and each species makes a vital contribution
to the totality of life on earth, and this contribution, contrary
to the expectations of standard evolutionary biology, need not
have any direct benefit for the organism itself.’ He then explains
how bacteria that transform nitrogen from the air into fixed
nitrogen compounds, such as ammonia, which plants then feed
on, don’t directly benefit from doing so. But they do benefit in
the long run – the nitrogen they put into the soil grows plants
that grow roots that grow fungi, which eventually give nutrients
back to the bacteria. Eisenstein maintains that is not just good
luck, but the way nature works – it is more akin to cooperation
than competition.
Eisenstein says economies can and have been cooperative,
and that a purely competitive economy is not normal. ‘In nature,
headlong growth and all-out competition are features of immature
ecosystems, followed by complex interdependency, symbiosis,
cooperation.’ He argues that our economy is about to enter a more
developed stage, like that of nature. ‘The next stage of human
economy will parallel what we are beginning to understand about
nature. It will call forth the gifts of each of us; it will emphasize
cooperation over competition; it will encourage circulation over
hoarding; and it will be cyclical, not linear. Money ... will serve a
diminished role even as it takes on more of the properties of the
gift. The economy will shrink, and our lives will grow.’
Our greatest opportunity is developing more complex highways
of exchange between people, creatures and beings that are
different to us, and building diverse relations into our patterns to
ensure we have constant renewal and regeneration of relations
and knowledge.We must find a way to release the tightened iron grip of impact
systems that are so rigid in their predictive controls; we must
embrace the power of network and emergent design, and use
social networks for good. We need to carve out space for sage
thinkers in our digital landscape. I want to see people becoming
citizen journalists (a true journalist chases truth from all angles,
and that means listening, understanding, giving space and validity
to all different views, to knowledge accumulated, to shared
meaning-making – not soap-box fixed singular opinions parading
as permanent truth). I want to see people harnessing the power of
the internet to share knowledge, bring people to work together, to
build a fairer world. When we reclaim the town square, we allow
our network designers to design networks that don’t focus on our
expert opinion, on our own singular voice, on our ability to be a
personal brand.
We don’t have all the answers. We don’t even know all the
questions. But when we build our impact systems on some
element of ‘we don’t know’ then we leave space for emergence.
Relational economies already exist. We are all in one.
Complexity already exists. Different models of valuing already
exist. Our struggle is the process of translation, of transforming
the financial economy into a relational economy. The networks
we inherit don’t have to stay as they are. We have created the
marketplaces, we have created the measurement systems, we
have created the connections. The issues are that they are not
natural in their life span or their relations. But they can be.
It’s the systems thinking, grounded in intelligence that
runs back 60,000+ years, that I believe in. Most of our current
models are way too reductive and simplified, but Indigenous
systems thinking naturally understands complexity and systems.

From nature we have models that give us a chance to regenerate
and lift up our own systems, to enrich the river through relations.
Like the platypus. The churn enriches the current-see.
Indigenous Australian intelligence has lived for 60,000 years
because it is shared. The 200-plus years in which it has not been
valued is a mere blip in time. Imagine the effect it could have if
it is deeply valued and how that could impact across another
60,000 years. Songlines from Broome to Berlin, from Wollongong
to Willamsburg. This is the moment in history when relations can
spread further and faster across the world than ever before. There
is no reason why we can’t emerge in deeper relation with a plan for
human custodial life on Earth for another 60,000 years.Here it is my friends. Secrets are rewarded.
Secret knowledge is a competitive advantage, rewarded with
the ability to raise the price, thus increasing profit.
China kept the secret of how to manufacture silk for several
thousand years. Revealing the secret was punishable by death.
Silk, a material so superior to all others for so many centuries,
being light and strong, was in huge demand all across the trading
world. It made China very, very rich.
But follow the logic thread here: the ‘smart’ thing to do is
keep your knowledge secret. You benefit; everyone else pays and
suffers. That’s good for one person (or group, or country) – and
bad for the rest of the world. Keeping secrets keeps knowledge.
It is the opposite of mentoring, which is the sharing of knowledge.
It is the opposite of the essence of Indigenous knowledge systems
in Australia, which likewise are a passing on of knowledge, so we
can stay in relation to the past, to the present, to the future.
Let our minds take a minute and explore some of the changes
that could happen if secret knowledge became shared knowledge.
Let’s say the clothmaker shares with their competitors their
dyeing secret. Okay, they lose their competitive advantage, which
may see a short-term decrease in financial profit as their peers
use that information – but what would they gain? In sharing their
secret would they gain relational capital with their industry peers?
No doubt.
Would their generosity potentially be exchanged down the
track with knowledge that would help them improve elements of
their business? The likelihood of this would increase.
Would they gain status as a teacher? Would they then have the
chance to help coach others in industry on innovation? Would this
4. Value shared knowledge, not secret knowledge
Lying on the floor of Sydney airport, I was reading Adam Smith’s
Wealth of Nations on the difference between market value and
natural value, looking at what drives prices up and down, I turned
the page and struck gold. Smith was writing about secrets.
‘Secrets in manufacturers are capable of being longer kept
than secrets in trade,’ he writes. ‘A dyer who has found the means
of producing a particular colour with materials which cost only
half the price of those commonly made use of, may, with good
management, enjoy the advantage of his discovery as long as he
lives, and even leave it as a legacy to his posterity.’

open up a marketplace where their intelligence could be rewarded
and valued as an innovator, and the act of sharing rewarded in the
model of teaching?
Would they speed up collective knowledge and progress?
Advancing joy with the possibilities of what can happen?
This sort of thing is already happening. There are countless
individuals on YouTube and other platforms sharing their
knowledge. There are free universities online. Wikipedia has got to
be one of the great network case studies of collective knowledge
sharing, not profit-based, moving knowledge to pass it on. The
revolution has begun.
Let’s go from the clothmaker to say, Google. What if Google
were to share its algorithms? Open source, out the door, off you
go. Would Google lose all its customers? What would it gain if it
went from competitor to mentor? From secret keeper to sharer?
If you think it’s naïve to hope that Google or Facebook or
Amazon or Apple could change, consider the pledges of Bill Gates
and Jeff Bezos to give away their fortunes, to fund good causes.
The revolution has begun.
But there is another system – English law – that lets the
clothmaker and Google keep their secrets. In particular, it’s
intellectual property law. That’s what lets us think that any of
these ideas are even ours. Don’t forget Ray Charles: ‘None of us
own the notes.’
I know as a person who creates things that I’m never really
making something outta nothing, it’s all mashups, bit of this
from here, bit of that from there. At best we can call ourselves
borrowers. And the tools I use to create? The computer I write this
book on, I had nothing to do with creating any of the technology.
The pencil I draw with dates back to at least the 18th century,when it was invented by the scientist Nicolas-Jacques Conté, who
served in the army of Napoleon Bonaparte. Every person who has
used a ‘lead’ pencil since (it’s actually graphite and clay) has relied
on nature yielding that material, shaped into being by the internal
fire in Earth’s core.
Even the seemingly definitive genius of Albert Einstein’s
E=MC2 is not just Einstein’s work. It’s the work of the Egyptians
and their numeral system, it’s Muhammad Ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi
who invented algebra, it’s the chalk that Einstein wrote with
on his chalkboard that was formed in the Cretaceous period
60-95 million years ago. The knowledge had been passed on via
scientists, nature, Einstein’s own genetic code, and then all of his
relations with the world around him.
Einstein’s life is an example of the gift of our greatest
intelligence form, imagination, allied to scientific knowledge and
research. Einstein’s knowledge was shared with the world, to make
sense of the universe. That was once the role of universities but
even they guard their intellectual property these days, having been
dragged into the financial economy, made to justify their existence
via profit and loss sheets. As if there is any loss in education.
If big companies don’t want to share their profit-making
knowledge, maybe governments could make them. We make
intellectual property laws, after all. Maybe intellectual copyright
on say life-saving drugs expires after two years, instead of fifteen?
Maybe an idea can be kept secret for a maximum of ten years?
Or instead of time, maybe after $10 million or $100 million profit is
gained, then the intellectual property has to be shared? Perhaps
we could set up smart contracts that establish a link back to
the creator or inventor through a mentor token, akin to artistic
resale royalties – call it a mentor credit.

Sharing secrets could also remove the masks that we wear
professionally, and allow us to turn away from the oppositional
energy that dominates business and academia. The world of
secrets takes us to the world of hidden agendas and mistrust, of
competition and deception. That is not a relational model that will
last, that will keep the planet and humanity going.
We’ve long been told competition drives progress. Would all
commerce and progress break down if we shared our secrets?
Do people work less effectively if they are not fighting each other?
These lines of thought take me to the late Shane Warne, a
cricketer, an idol of mine growing up, as I too was a leg-spinner.
The leg-spinner succeeds by deceiving the batsman (like a pitcher
in baseball), and Warne was by a big margin the greatest leg-
spinner in the history of the game. And he shared all his knowledge.
I could read about how Shane Warne bowled in magazines, I
could watch TV shows of Warne explaining the elements of how
to bowl, I could get training kits on how to bowl like Shane Warne.
Famously, he even shared his knowledge with the opposition.
Sharing secrets doesn’t mean you won’t still win.
In fact, you might win more, you might be able to move from
being isolated on top of your mountain to being a teacher, an
icon, a mentor. It might deepen your relational worth and might,
beyond your financial gains, make you experience eudaimonia.
Aristotle said eudaimonia was the highest good that humans could
strive for – it’s best translated as a life well lived.
Perhaps we can channel the power and force of competition if
we frame the pursuit effectively, if the pursuit is based on investing
in nature, in future generations, in imagination, in emergence.
Perhaps then we can still compete. What if the competition was
changed – instead of amassing the most money, the goal was tounderstand life, to live a good life, to achieve eudaimonia. Every
living creature ever could get into that competition. And the winner
gets joy and happiness and contentment.
Not fighting, not competing against each other.
How do you fight a fire? Bushfires ravage Australia, we are
stuck in fear of the flames, yet Indigenous systems thinking knows
how to work with fire, not by fighting it, but by burning ahead of it,
shepherding its way to a space where it would eventually burn out.
The fire is actually good fire, with purpose and intention; it burns to
help the trees grow, it burns to revitalise. We don’t want fire to go
out, we keep the flame alive. We relate to it – that’s the key point.
Its life is our life. It’s not a fight. So we turn it, move with it, shape
it, bend it. Ideally we would practise this before the big fires come,
we’d map paths for it, burn ahead of time, know nature and keep
working with its patterns. And most importantly, we’d learn to love
and respect the fire and its intelligence. We’d shared our secrets
before the moment of combat, diluting the need for combat.
It’s beyond the commonwealth of empire to own, it’s about the
common-health of knowledge of life on Earth.
Would sharing secrets mean we were less innovative? No.
Drawing out the secrets of knowledge, which are sitting in all our
tiny minds and tiny offices and tiny worlds, brings them to life;
the knowledge can then move with others’ knowledge, it can
germinate, it can iterate, it can grow, it can activate its intelligence
potential. It could, would, make us more innovative, more
imaginative, more intelligent. You’ve got to give it away to keep it.
Would this kill the share market and financial innovation?
Well, the whole theory of markets is that everyone has the same
information. Insider trading – where you have a special advantage
via inside information – is a crime. Here even the market sees the
127128
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
value of knowledge shared. Indigenous knowledge systems and
the financial market place have this in common.
Alongside our good secrets, what about sharing our failings?
Failure’s bad reputation is undeserved. It’s how we learn.
There is no failure, because we are all in relation. ‘Failure’ is at
the edges, it’s where those who go beyond what they know
start to learn. It’s where the growth and the gifts are for all of us.
A life built on the facade of perfection is the failure – a curated,
photoshopped face defining our being, when we are blotted,
blotched, bruised, bumped, bumbly, beings with bums out the
back. C’mon humans, release the reins a little, let failure flow.
When we stop competing and share our secret information,
we can free ourselves of the fear of failure. ‘Failure’ is a trap and a
gateway drug into spirals of shame. Transparency and openness
give us more of a chance to showcase our natural processes of
living, trying, learning, adapting, failing, trying again. Failing is
where the growth and the gifts are for all of us. Failing is what
we do when we’re learning. It’s where we put our attention that
shapes value; we are economists, and reclaiming faliure as a
process not an outcome can emancipate us.
When we focus on process, we release the desperation for
verification, for reputation, for being liked, we break down the
traps of the modern social platforms.
We’ve applied this philosophy at AIME to unlock the shackles
of shame that have been inherited by so many of the students we
work with, who have been told in so many ways that they are less
worthy. We do this by teaching with Failure Time, where students
interact with experiences with the intent to fail as much as
possible in the allotted time, to engage with failure as the process.With this mindset, we flip the script and release the shame in
trying, in starting, in putting our hand up, in being in relation.
When you land outside the margins not only do you have the
issues of shame, you also have fewer second chances, let alone
third or fourth chances. If you make a mistake in class, you are
quickly judged to be a student who has problems; if you make a
mistake with the law, then the pathways and patterns are so well
established to accelerate roads to imprisonment, and the lack of
network and support of influence (like having a family friend who is
a lawyer) accelerates this ride.
On the topic of shame, as I look at my home country, it’s
time to see Australians, including our First Australians, know our
intelligence and worth on a global stage, to cast off the shackles
of shame that have strangled our country from birth. A country
born when a swathe of convicts took their shame and were sent
across the world, feeling the lowest of the low. When they arrived
in the new country, they found Indigenous Australians, and like the
bullied kid who becomes the bully, they passed on the shackles
of shame, systemically working to subjugate a brilliant human
race. Against this doubled pain and doubled shame of our past,
we must emerge and realise that we are not an island, we are
interconnected globally, that we must play beyond our borders.
Progress for only one group will not change the face of inequity; to
do that we must move what we all value, and how we measure its
impact and worth.
Normalising failure – which is normal to start with – softens
the threats developed by the system that freezes students,
so they never put their hand up because of fear. Normalising
failure is liberating. It turns failure from an outcome to a process.

The result is not necessarily where the satisfaction lies – the
richness of life is in exploring the highways of process before the
outcome. We make story together for the relations we build during
the process – story is about understanding each other, not about
the applause from a crowd when the show is finally revealed.
Process, process, process. I would love nothing more than to
one day turn on the news and hear the prime minister say, ‘I was
wrong, and I learned this because after I did the press conference
some experts got in touch with me and taught me more. I now
know more than I did yesterday, and that’s why we are adapting
the strategy we presented yesterday.’ Process, failure, growth,
adaptation, emergence. Reality.
Coming back to the floor of Sydney airport, the work of
Adam Smith and secrets of the trade, I’m proposing a code of
ethics in the form of knowledge sharing, a mentoring code, where
knowledge must be shared with everyone, all the time, for free,
because that’s the only debt we should repay for our life, that we
pass on all we learn, in real time.
The revolution has begun: look at COVID-19. It’s such a rich
case study of global competitive co-operation, showing how
we can still motivate ourselves with competition, not against
other people, but for other people and other species. Thinking
five ways: /\\/–. In a pandemic we are competing with time. We
are competing with death. We are striving to share, to learn, to
overcome, to unlock knowledge through our collective imaginings.
Death brings us together. People tell their secrets as they
approach death – and when organisations start to design with
death in mind, they start to release their secrets too. (More on this
in the last chapter.)This example, this pandemic, should form the cornerstone of
our scientific, university, educational, economic, network DNA – to
move quickly, adaptively, openly. The pressure is still well and truly
on with climate change, automation, food challenges, so let’s keep
building together.
5. Centre nature and design with, from and in relation
to nature
Our skin regenerates itself roughly every 27 days. It’s our largest
organ, and to stay alive the cells have to divide and grow. The
Earth rotates once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09053
seconds, known as the sidereal period, and its circumference is
roughly 40,075 kilometres. The surface of the Earth at the equator
spins at a speed of 460 metres per second, or roughly 1000 miles
per hour. Light moves at 299,792 kilometres a second.
All of which is to say: change is inevitable and universal.
Heraclitus didn’t have the stats but he knew it all the same:
‘The only constant in life is change.’
And yet, the lie we live is that things stay the same. We pretend
change isn’t happening at warp speed inside, outside and all
around us every second of our existence.
What’s the final fundamental flaw in our design around
organisations?
We pretend that they aren’t alive.

I was speaking to my friend and now the chairperson of AIME,
Paul Kearney, founder and leader of financial services firm Kearney
Group, on this topic. He reflected: ‘I’ve long pointed out to our
team that the word “organisation” evokes hierarchy and org charts
and structure. Yet it is derived from “organism” – we all know and
are comfortable with the idea that organisms are amorphous
and growing and shifting and changing. Clearly, when the term
organisation was coined, this was understood. However, strangely
yet emphatically, that connection of understanding is lost in
Western culture when we think about our organisations.’
We create buildings in cities that remove us from the natural
world; we block out sunlight and look into screens; we talk of
efficiencies and production lines, productivity, risk, policies,
procedures, strategy. Hey, wait! We missed something. We ain’t
machines! We are human – we are very much living beings – and
we have humanity to talk about.
Human beings are the ones that make organisations. We are
unpredictable, and we sense and feel our way through. Right
now we feel lost, in part, because we’ve come to believe that
organisations determine who we are, and are responsible for
the ideas and for everything else. We are the ones that wear the
uniforms; the uniforms don’t wear us. Relationships are inefficient.
They take time. Time that can’t be predicted in an operational plan.
They are unwieldy, chaotic, ever changing and emergent. They
can’t be controlled. And they yield the deepest energy source we
can find – love. They bring returns on hope. They bring knowledge.
They bring kindness. Ultimately they bring life – they make us.
And if something inefficient can produce the humans we are and
the humans we grow into, one must ask, is it really so inefficient?
Again another challenge with our modern balance sheet is thefinite separation of value into two measurements – financial and
non-financial. There is a return on relations and it should be central
to our accounting methods. That’s what we should focus on at
year’s end.
We are alive – and our organisations should be modelled on
life. We could and should be looking at the designs of mycelium
networks, of cellular systems inside our bodies. We should
design off the back of the most successful live, adaptable
systems, not off the back of the fixed permanent bottom lines
and efficient, repeatable robotic movements of Detroit car
assembly lines. Organisations need to get back to their roots –
organic, organism.
We often ask our organisations and their leaders to protect us
from the ‘outside world’, to have clear lines of direction, to have a
plan, to predict the future. Seriously, how does anyone with any
real self-reflection and awareness pretend they know the future?
We can try with the best knowledge we have, but we are still
guessing. We can’t ever say ‘This is the way’ and not realise there
are millions of pathways to the future in every single moment for
every single organism on Earth.
Progress is a pendulum, swinging backwards and forwards –
we get it wrong, we get it right – and I’m wondering whether
the model of having all this decision power cycling up, often to
one person in all our organisations, isn’t destined to see us keep
looping backwards and forwards. Is there a way to take the flawed
nature of our logical mind, our planning mind, and mesh it with
feeling, sensing, and building other systems for decision-making?
A few years back I interviewed firefighter Captain Terry Brody,
the Captain of Ladder 10 in NYC, whose first day on the job, as a
rookie, was 9/11. When I asked Terry about how he leads people
133134
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
into fire, he said, ‘People want to be led.’ I agree in part with that,
but leaders also want to follow. Our life is not isolated; Terry can
lead me, I can lead Terry, a person can be led and lead within
five minutes of relating to two different entities. That makes the
question of who leads, and how, all the more important. And what
to expect of our leaders?
I became a CEO at twenty-two years old, and since then have
been trying to play my part in the role. I’ve been operating in
and around burnout for almost my whole time leading AIME, and
every time it’s gotten easy, I’ve felt guilty. I’d look to heroes like
the civil rights leaders who have given it their all, sacrificed their
lives, and think that I must put myself through pain to achieve
the level of change that’s required – ‘no pain, no gain’. I couldn’t
see that when it’s easy, it’s in flow – that’s when you’ve cracked
natural design.
After going through one of the most significant burnout
periods and experiencing depression in 2019, as I mentioned
earlier, I struggled to handle the criticism of my leadership and
vision, and felt so alone in it all. I was forced by depression to take
time to rest and to think.
During this time I was searching for an answer as to
what organisational health looks like in the 21st century. What is
the organisational model to scale health?
If you were starting an organisation today, would you design it
with hierarchy? Would you have a main boss? Would you design
a circular system, maybe even a reverse triangle? How would you
design to surf the waves of change?
Our organisation has grown from an idea on one campus, to
an Australian company structure, to a global organisation. All the
while, re-imagining and re-inventing to find the right balance in anecosystem of people carrying intergenerational trauma and those
with capital wealth, power and privilege.
In 2020, AIME had finally landed in the world of global leaders
of change in education. We’d landed a digital curriculum and
had established ourselves in six countries. We’d built a group of
people who had learned through experience that change – along
with imagination – was one of our superpowers, that constant
adaptation could help us to be the most impactful versions of
ourselves, that our freedom was in failure, and that by adopting
a ‘yes and’ attitude, we could achieve remarkable outcomes,
remarkably quickly. We’d created our rocket ship of attitude and
culture and we had a wholeness of accepting each other. The
trade-off I’d had to make for the global organisation structure
was to separate us by our regions and nation states, Africa
here, Australia there, different entities. This didn’t sit right: one
organisation was what I believed in, but there isn’t an inherited
governance frame for that.
When COVID hit, suddenly governance and borders were out
the window and we were all in this together, and I rapidly began
searching for how to crack the code on our organisational model:
how do we organise ourselves to collectively create change across
the Earth’s surface? There will be more on this when we talk about
IMAGI-NATION in the next chapter, but for now I’ll focus on how to
think about how we design our organising.
The pandemic had thrown us all into the imagicells in between
caterpillar and butterfly mode, and everything was up for grabs.
I was searching for the next insight, the next iteration. I felt
swamped with an overload of news, an upheaval of the world.
Staring down mass unemployment and huge fiscal change, I’d
lined up the economic narratives to devour and try to understand
135136

more of the levers that have created this unfair, unbalanced,
out-of-relation world. Then I stumbled across Reinventing
Organisations by Frederic Laloux, published in 2014.
Dear Frederic, you nailed it. Laloux described what I had been
dreaming of: a world of cellular cluster designs, self-organising,
and regenerating, where leadership responded to those on the
front line, not dictating and managing their behaviour.
I had felt constantly tired as a CEO, exhausted by the hierarchy
that put me in the decision-making seat constantly. I’m just not
smart enough to make informed decisions every few minutes; no
one is. It’s not good for me, and not good for the organisation. So
I finished sketching a new organisational strategy that removed
management, and penned this note to our team: ‘We trust you to
do your job. There is no management – you self-manage.’
One of the most instructive case studies in Reinventing
Organisations was the Buurtzorg healthcare model in Holland,
where the head office became more of a back-office support
function and teams were organised into circles of ten with mixed
experience levels of nurses and healthcare support workers.
They were given a region to look after and space to self-organise,
with the goal of providing healthcare for the region. They found
innovation where repeatable control models couldn't, they found
humanity and relations, and they were incredibly successful in their
healthcare results. This cellular, circular decentralisation, fusing
in healthy human relations and uncle/nephew flow, is so in sync
with Indigenous systems thinking and our natural world of system
realities. I felt we had to follow this path.
From then we benched the CEO role. I worked as a designer
for a year, and we built a more self-directed organisation. People
approved their own leave. We had twenty to thirty mentors-in-residence who supported thirty of our leaders every three months.
We had teams work out solutions together and resisted the urge
to give the decision-making to a ‘leader’. We implemented a daily
ninety-minute cell on a topic and invited the whole organisation
to be involved: one day the cell would be about our university, the
next day our TV network, and the next day our fashion line. We left
the brief really open and let it emerge.
Mycelium was what we were studying and looking to for how
to shape our organisational design – the fungal network that lives
under the ground, connecting trees to each other, the internet of
the forest. They perform so many tasks in their network design it
makes you feel like you’re in Star Trek – and it turns out Star Trek
used the mycelium network for narrative inspiration and systemic
design, so maybe you actually are in Star Trek.
Okay, back to Earth. How did all this decentralisation and
weaving with mycelium systems go? What was the effect of
transparency? Two things happened.
The first was that there was a huge amount of knowledge
shared, we embraced the knowledge being activated from the
front line, we were nimble. When we had a project to work on we
could spin it up real quick and get information out to the team
rapidly. It was a rich arena for collective imagining and co-design.
The second was that we struggled to make firm decisions and
actions to finish the projects we’d spun up. We’d get to this place
where it was close and then it felt like there was a desire to have
someone take responsibility for pressing the ‘go’ button in case
something went wrong. As Captain Brody said, sometimes people
like to be led.
Decentralisation works, with decisive leadership. Complex?
Two conflicting thoughts? You betcha.

So I’ve since returned to a CEO role (but expanded and
shared – more on that in the next section) – and it’s a joy to work
in an organisation that has these behavioural flows underpinning
it, that can move in circles, where the team has encouragement
to feel the way, to feel the vibes and move with the energy, and
with leadership still there where needed. In many ways I feel
like this is modelling the flow between financial models (with
all their structures, repeatability, efficiencies and controls) and
more emergent design systems, with awareness, responsiveness,
imagination, adaptability. And with nature and change at the centre.unlikely connections have become the process to invest in, the
compass, the direction of the relation. The shape of the relation
can be very effectively applied with aunty/uncle\nephew/niece
mentoring patterns, with systemic mentoring, with knowledge
flows, intention, ceremony in and ceremony out. The job of
mentoring is that each party is stronger after their time together,
and they can keep moving through the world – it’s like a fuel stop,
and the best sustaining fuel on Earth is knowledge.
Our main knockout for AIME at the start was building a
drawbridge, a scaffolding, between the castle of universities and
kids in schools, kids who could be left behind. Between Indigenous
and non-Indigenous people. It was unlikely connections × 2.
And it was powerful when those people were on the bridge. The
limitations to the network design became apparent at scale.
The first limitation was in addressing the question of how to
alleviate inequity. As it turns out, inequity is shared across almost
eight billion people and billions of billions of other animals. It’s
what we value, where and how – which is the point of this book.
Simply, the value economically for Indigenous people was in our
Indigenousness; the othering was the marketplace. For real value
and wealth, we needed to find space for our intelligence to be
centred in the systems design frame.
Another flaw was behavioural reversion – ten years on,
those who came from privilege had returned to their base camp,
reflecting on how they knew an Indigenous person once.
A final challenge with scaffolding, like our early design, is that
it makes for a rainbow bridge between dull grey buildings. Think of
the image of the builders in New York sitting on the wire between
buildings eating their lunch – that wire and those workers were the
early AIME, and the action had to shift from the lunchbreak wire
6. Network with unlikely connections, specifically UNC×5
We’ve journeyed so far into the heart of relational design, but
there’s a key step to come – unlocking a pattern to plug in and
regenerate the biggest source of untapped human intelligence on
Earth, the intelligence outside the margins.
Mentoring is a design tool that I stumbled across to help us
make unlikely connections, with each other and with knowledge.
I don’t think the world we inherited is filled with evil people; rather,
our networks are flawed, they manipulate, sell, control, divide,
exclude. It’s the networks that have to be shifted. People go where
the roads and bridges and trains take them – those pathways need
to be re-routed. To design against hegemony, institutionalisation,
decay and inequity of knowledge, we need unlikely connections –
138

act of a few builders, to those inside the building and the way they
lived their lives.
So how could we shift the network?
Hold up your hands, check out the five digits on one hand.
Imagine each of the digits as a being, and the space between the
fingers the space of unlikely connections between each relation.
Then get yourself incy-wincy-spidering with your other hand –
okay, now we’ve got ourselves a re-generative network with
unlikely connections × 5 (UNC×5) powering the core.
Why five, you ask?
As we explored relational patterns, we found that once we
reach unlikely connections × 5, there starts to be a stickiness to
the shape – a circular energy, a sense that if someone dropped
out, the other four would find a way to keep generating the energy
and connections. It becomes a parallel generative nucleus from
our inherited core of family and friends. Addressing the pattern
of inheritance.
The most important realisation for me is that at UNC×5,
when each new connection is unlikely, the previously established
networks unravel, the patterns of specialisation and race and
culture and nations and fixed mindsets evaporate, and the space
in between is humankind. In the complexities, we find deep
commonalities, like our imagination, our ability to laugh, our
relationships with nature, our feelings of love.
Plus, I like the fact that it’s the same number as the fingers on
our hands, it’s natural intelligence – and that the word ‘digits’ is a
synonym for both ‘numbers’ and ‘fingers’.
It turns out there’s a heap of research around the number
five being the ideal team size. Huge armies frequently organise
soldiers into groups of five. Jeff Bezos reckons the ideal team sizeof Amazon workers was the number of people that could share a
pizza for a meal – roughly five.
British anthropologist Robin Dunbar has spent decades
mapping relationships, and has found that five is the ideal number
of close friends for most of us. And it’s also how we grow our
network to model up to 150, which according to Dunbar is the
number of people we can have meaningful relations with.
Tyson contacted Dunbar and we three had a chat on Tyson’s
podcast. The possible variance in the node was fascinating:
could one of your five connections be imaginary? Could they be
non-human? Could they be a being from the past? Or the future?
Dunbar said: ‘No law says that the people in your social network
have to be people, and have to be alive. You can have your
ancestors in there, you can have your favourite religious figures,
you can have your favourite character from Neighbours, if you
must. The question is, do you feel you have a relation with them?'
We had a deep, rich weave, and when we explained IMAGI-
NATION (see next chapter), Dunbar encouraged us that we were
on the right path, that story brought communities together.
Our point of difference was adding a generative design
element to who and what was the five – ensuring the biggest
possible unlikely connections leap from one person, being, entity,
to the next (based on background or knowledge or other factors),
and continuing this until we found our five. To re-pattern the
network, we had to find our unlikely five, then connect the pattern
in sets of five. Incy. Wincy. Spider.
And thus we had an algorithm on our hands, a design formula
for a regenerative network in flow, in relation, moving knowledge
inside and outside the margins, giving those outside the margins
many avenues, not just in their own postcode or nation state.

UNC×5s keep multiplying and shifting, constantly bringing in
more unlikely connections.
A study published in Nature in August 2022 (‘Social capital II:
determinants of economic connectedness’) looked at the
friendship connections of over 72 million people across the US and
the correlation with inequity. A key conclusion was that unlikely
connections, shifting the network from affirming likely connections
among social groups, race groups or economic status, created
more equality. Ray Chetty, Harvard economist and co-author of
the paper, summarised the findings this way: ‘Growing up in a
community connected across class lines improves kids’ outcomes
and gives them a better shot at rising out of poverty.’
In the development of our university (more to come on
that in the next chapter), we built tutorial groups of unlikely
connections × 5, having one executive, one teacher, one school
student, one university student and one citizen. We saw in the
university examples like this. It starts with an O Week tutorial
group: Rearna from Australia × Hilalnur from Turkey × Bissane
from Lebanon × Tracey from South Africa × Irmin in Kenya.
Rearna is in the {Citizens} stream; her change project is to
support people experiencing homelessness in Adelaide. As they
talk, she mentions, ‘Nia is the reason I’m here.’ Nia is an educator
at Rearna’s school in Adelaide. She graduated from {Uni} as a
citizen in 2021 and has returned in 2022 to keep working on
bringing opportunities for feeding and freeing imagination into
the school and broader community. She connects with Irmin in
Kenya about the AIME × #LearningPlanet imagination project,
looking at transforming education with imagination, and Irmin
invites her to join the live show on IMAGI-NATION {TV} to launch
the project. On the show with Nia is Tanatsiwa, a school studentfrom Zimbabwe, who Irmin has also invited to join the imagination
project. Tanatsiwa graduated from the {Writers} stream in 2021.
She has come back in 2022 with a change project targeting
conflict resolution, drug use and suicide among young people
that evolved out of her writing project the year before. After the
show, the #LearningPlanet team connects Tanatsiwa with Kiran
in India to explore the intersections across their work. Tanatsiwa’s
highlight connection through {Uni} in her first year is with Mateus,
a school student in Brazil enrolled in the {Filmmakers} stream who
encouraged her writing and her change project. Mateus was also
a panellist on IMAGI-NATION {TV} in 2021 where he got talking
with James in Texas, one of the {Uni} alliance partners, about uni
opportunities for students like him who are not native English
speakers. From that exchange, Mateus ended up applying to go to
uni at Texas A&M International University, where James is a dean.
James, enrolled in the {Executives} stream this year, contacts the
{Uni} team asking for support with website and app development
for an ambassador for their change project. Ben in Brisbane steps
up to help. The ambassador in question is Hilalnur, the school
student from Turkey in the tutorial group with Rearna and Irmin,
where this story started. The Vice Chancellor is Steph, Australia’s
first Indigenous Vice Chancellor, now leading the {Uni} globally
with the professors who are all puppets. Jane Goodall and Tyson
Yunkaporta and Sal Khan give guest lectures. Man, it just keeps
unfurling in the very best natural way.
Another UNCx5 example: for six years at AIME we had a co-
CEO model to plug a node of young diverse talent directly into the
leadership and boardrooms of our organisation. We found that
picking one person, who hasn’t got the experience acquired over
time yet, and then thrusting them with a title immediately into a
143144
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
space of new status and influence, was so charged. The design
of this frame was steeped in the hero’s journey, and the hero’s
journey is an impossible fable because we are not individually
brilliant, we are the sum of our relations: we ain’t heroes, we are
humans. And on the other side of the bridge, I found it a struggle
to have the one-on-one pressure of a co-CEO connected to me.
And when the year was over, the relationship ended and I couldn’t
work out the ceremony that could see a healthy transition from
super deep connected relation, to then pretty much no structured
connection. I had to keep doing my job, they had to move to their
next role, how could we make this healthier?
In 2022 we decided to UNC×5 the co-CEO role and see
what happened. We selected four people from four different
countries, and connected them with me to make our five. We
then UNC×5’d their experience across the organisation, moving
to connect with one department lead in AIME every two months,
meaning they get at least five different lead relations and topic
areas to work on. It’s meant I can drop my guard a bit and listen
to their peer knowledge and experience. It’s much healthier for
all of us. More weave. More relations. More sharing of expertise
and intelligence. More space for failure and imperfection. More
sustainable. More embracing of impermanence. Less individually
reliant. More growth. More impact.
Once we hit the twelve-year mark at AIME, around 2016,
I could no longer ignore the obvious – there were monstrous
untapped limits to the networks the kids had access to. It was like
patchy internet coverage – bright spots, not a bright system. They
were getting a network to a university locally and other networks
nationally in Australia. But there was one big whopping ceiling.
It was called ‘Indigenous affairs’. Economically, value forIndigenous people and the pathway into financial return on value
came in the form of employment for the most part in Indigenous-
defined positions in the mainstream or in Indigenous affairs. The
country was split in two economic worlds: Indigenous and non-
Indigenous, two huge sweeping general brushstrokes to separate
two classes of citizens. A narrow straitjacket that needs to be
busted open.
Enter UNC×5. When a young Indigenous Australian person is in
relation to a university student in Kampala, a teacher in Berlin, an
investor in New York and a visual artist in Tokyo, the straitjacket
falls off. We got ourselves some pathways. By zooming out, the
perspective is changed and context is enlarged. Imagination
flows and frees one from the prison of local limits and inherited
grievance. With UNC×5 we can break outta the prison, become
unstuck, and move past the vision of equality to a bigger vision,
a vision of abundance, through intelligence, relational, collective
knowledge, held today, passed to tomorrow.
And if we are serious about solving inequity, these kids have
gotta be able to have value in any system, locally or globally,
not just stuck in a little corner called ‘Indigenous affairs’. If we
continue to get Indigenous knowledge systems to the front of the
design development of financial and investment products and
processes in places like New York, then we’re rolling. Intelligence
is the uniting force, the pathway to an abundant healthy life on
Earth. We’re getting there.
Ultimately I think if we were all mentors and mentees, and in
turn all mentees and mentors, swapping the aunty/niece roles,
we will have embedded a fundamental of Indigenous systems
thinking into the world. In the non-Indigenous world, mentor
and mentee rarely exchange positions; in this other model, they
145Hoodie EconomicsRelations
always do, it’s a seesaw. It’s not just about the mentor teaching,
the mentee listening and absorbing the other’s world view. It’s
in flow, relational, diagonal, up and down, nephew listening and
interchanging role with uncle, which helps both grow.
In essence, this is the heart of Hoodie Economics. The citizen
role is the mentor/mentee\mentee/mentor.
We are only a year or two into formalising the UNC×5 model
across our network. We think it’s a model for others to build their
project teams. We’ve seen in our work that it activates imaginative
thinking and illuminates where the organisation is homogenous
and needs regeneration. UNC×5 is also a circular cellular – a
model that can take the pressure off individual leadership and the
hierarchy, like the Buurtzorg healthcare model. And the richness of
unlikely connections honours the seesaw mentoring that can flow
from aunty/niece\uncle/nephew role relations.impermanence of life. Since then, she has dedicated herself to the
benefit of humankind.
Miao let truth flow that day. One gem in particular, glimmering
with a purple and bronze haze, emerged into the room when
Miao spoke about how we relate to each other and the
process of kindness. Miao explained that we have to practise
receiving kindness.
In this moment I realised that give-give is not enough. We also
have to practise how to receive offerings, knowledge and energy,
otherwise the energy is blocked, the current stops and we lose our
current-see. Unlike give-take, give-give doesn’t assume that in the
act of giving one will get an immediate return from the person they
have given to, but it does assume that as we give-give, we will also
be receiving, and sometimes receiving in abundance, maybe even
receiving-receiving.
Miao’s words sung to the roots of the thinking we’ve been
dancing through – not only must we practise our giving in relation,
but also practise our receiving in relation. To practise saying yes
when someone makes an offer of kindness – that is an art for a
relational economy. To practise listening when someone has been
thinking about your life and makes an offer on what you may do
with your life, to feel this energy in gratitude – that takes effort too,
one we need to learn and practise.
When we release control and humbly receive, we let the
energy flow through us and around us. We can see so many of the
gifts that are there in abundance every day and that we too often
walk past.
When receiving an offering of an idea or advice or a suggestion,
we can honour the offer – we may not agree with the idea, but we
can receive in our hearts the energy of thoughtfulness, of thought.
7. Give-give, receive-receive – energy, knowledge, time,
opportunities
On 16 July 2022 I found myself at the Nan Tien Temple in
Wollongong, New South Wales. It’s a Buddhist temple and I was
there delivering a speech as part of an event on virtue alongside
Venerable Miao You, a well-known figure in the area. She adopted
a monastic lifestyle after 9/11, which brought home for her the
146

I feel this in spaces AIME curates. When we get it right you can
almost see the particles of energy bursting through the surface as
we witness the systemic practice of give-give, receive-receive, in
a never-ending, overlaying, moving pattern of energy rivers. When
we map this (which is what I found myself painting for this chapter)
our relational economies are enriched.
Online we already have a relational economy architecture at
scale, in the form of social media networks. But the exchanges
are with shadows. They take our time, our attention, the gift of our
minds, lost in their little distractions – then they sell our data. The
relational economies we have are sick. Very, very sick.
The relational economy AIME is working in is centred on
Indigenous systems thinking, on relating to each other, on building
across our nuclear family, or, as Tyson said to me, ‘giving and not
expecting anything in return and knowing it’s not a waste of time’.
What’s the exchange value when we give our time to someone
and don’t expect a direct benefit? Is the benefit when we give
without expectations that sometime we can be surprised with joy
and happiness? That we can feel satisfied? Anchored in relations?
Dare I say complete – as opposed to the incompleteness that
looking at the perfect lives of Instagram influencers brings? After
a day of exchanging, building, sharing skills, the only people that
know are those you are in relation with. We invest in process
not outcome. The energy transfer is real. The energy lives on
beyond us, but in a healthy flow. It’s the sort of energy transfer in
relations that can help sustain intelligent life in sync with nature for
60,000+ years.
Beyond giving and not expecting anything in return, I think
we should go larger: delete the focus on any return. Giving is
investment – receiving is the externality. When we give-give,then the energy moves-moves, and it moves at speed. When we
give-give, there will by design be receiving-receiving – it’s supply
and demand networked relationally. When giving we unlock our
relation to everything.
As we wrap up the this chapter, let’s look back together through a
game of reflection tennis.
The opening serve came with velocity and directness down
the T of the court as we expanded our minds with the idea that
everything is in relation, and we have to look at the biggest possible
view. As we visualised our return of serve, we looked at the whole
court and activated our imagination to shape a rich spinning slice
backhand into the corner of the deuce side of the court – the slice
spin allowed us to anchor the belief that activating imagination
creates space for spin and movement in sync with the Earth’s
natural spin, change and movement. From the deuce court, we
149150
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
replied by looping a heavy top-spinning forehand back down
the line, sending the ball up into space – and as the ball space-
travelled, we replaced the painted straight lines and square edges
with string and rope in the shapes of circles, curves and loops that
wove from the court and into the stands, and across the world.
The new lines reminded us to shift how we shape the impact, how
we shape the court, to have emergence as the process to design
impact tools. When the ball returned from orbit it landed on one
of the ropes and spun up into the crowd and out of the stadium.
Along the way it grew a mouth and began to share every secret
it had learned since the oldest known ball, an Egyptian child’s
toy made of linen rags and string from 2500 BC, and the secrets
were shared as the ball followed the weaves of the court around
the world, with everyone, everywhere, knowledge flowed freely.
The ball spun into a hole and we found ourselves staring at the
underground luminescent network web of mycelium and took
notes as we were reminded of our custodial role, and of nature
as the source of intelligence, and the place intelligence should
be returned to. The plates shifted underneath us and a small
volcanic eruption took the ball into a meeting room in New York,
where we adjusted the make-up of the room from ten people of
similar knowledge fields, to unlikely connections by five, suddenly
connecting the office to entities that are non-human, past, present,
across borders, spiders, even Spider Man, and then everyone in
the office was singing ‘Incy Wincy Spider’. Together they made a
huge web and spun the tennis ball to the centre of the web to a
kindness shop where patterns were lighting up the system, give-
give, receive-receive, networked.
From tennis to some case studies on relations versus financial
profit, and some thoughts around Australian Aboriginality.In February 2022, northern NSW and south-east Queensland
were under water, thanks to weeks of torrential rain. One town in
particular, Lismore, was devastated with unprecedented flooding.
My sister, Ella Bancroft, and her partner, were soon on the ground
there, volunteering their help with the recovery, and a month later
I went up with some crew from AIME to help Ella and the crew
at The Koori Mail, the national Indigenous newspaper, who were
driving the community-organised disaster response.
When we drove into Lismore the devastation was palpable –
it was like a bomb had gone off. Houses were inside out. Stuff
was everywhere. The place was gutted. The town was already
experiencing a homelessness crisis, and now thousands more had
been made homeless. Even the town’s homeless service, Social
Futures, had been flooded.
My thoughts turned to the tourist hotspot of Byron Bay and its
surrounding regions, just forty minutes’ drive north from Lismore,
and Airbnb.
A little background. Byron Bay has a problem – the people who
work there, pouring beers and coffee, doing all the maintenance
and building – can’t afford to live there, because landlords are
better off Airbnbing to holiday-makers who pay more for their
week of holidays. Airbnb is already facing bans or regulations in
big destinations – Berlin, Barcelona, Paris, New York – because
it has driven up housing costs and driven up homelessness,
gutting neighbourhoods and killing local cohesion. Looking over
the horizon, there’s a homelessness disaster on the doorstep in
Lismore, but empty houses in Byron Bay.
Let’s play out a thought experiment: what if instead of Airbnb
doing what it has always done, maybe it goes UNC×5. Step one –
set the intention: solve homelessness. Step two – deepen the
151152
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
relations. Add in, say: national government × state government ×
local government × the homeless population × those rebuilding
their flood-damaged homes. In expanding its relational framework,
Airbnb increases its intelligence. The elements of this UNC×5
include: government is looking for new land and would pay for
the land to build community housing; climate change is making
housing investments more fragile in many regions; service
providers pay for temporary housing; Airbnb owners have homes
empty for much of the year; towns and cities are losing their
relational health, becoming split by $$ not woven richly across
different cultures, ages, backgrounds, knowledge fields. Stir the
pot around and the idea emerges. Airbnb says to government, ‘Will
you subsidise our owners to offer long-term community housing to
marginalised people?’ Suburbs of high wealth with holiday rentals
suddenly get an influx of diversity, which creates relational health,
and people who are homeless suddenly have homes. Suddenly
Airbnb’s value has expanded beyond any financial return, to
become the global leader in housing.
As we step out of the thought experiment into reality, Airbnb
currently does temporary disaster relief in the non-profit arm of
its work – the relational work is on the outer edge, not at the core.
Imagine more. If Airbnb zoomed out to become a social enterprise
that didn’t divide communities; they could lead the decentralised
economy of tech firms that have flipped the model of ownership
to the individual, and lead through the next decade with relational
health being the heart of the model. Airbnb, if it went relational at
its core, could help solve global homelessness.
And let’s be clear, problems like homelessness can be solved
with systemic relational design. It has been done already – let’s
look to Singapore for example.Singapore had one of the worst housing markets in the world
half a century ago, with tens of thousands of people living in slums,
which amplified racial tensions. Now more than ninety per cent of
people own their own home and Singapore has all but eradicated
homelessness.
That success was driven in part by a disaster, in 1961, as
journalist Adam Majendie wrote in an article on Singapore’s home
ownership rates for Bloomberg in July 2020: ‘On the afternoon of
Hari Raya Haji, one of the biggest Muslim holidays of the year, a fire
broke out in the shanty town of Bukit Ho Swee, razing an area the
size of eight football fields of densely packed slums.’ That disaster
killed four people and made 16,000 homeless. Singapore’s new
Housing Development Board rehoused the 16,000 people within a
year, and 400,000 people by the end of the 60s.
The board now runs one million apartments, which it
meticulously maintains. Its apartments are offered for sale
on ninety-nine-year leases, with limitations on when they can
be resold to stop profiteering. More recent legislation in 1989
mandated unlikely connections, and this was done with immense
detail, where every apartment building had to have the same
percentage of racial groups as the general population – everyone
has a seat at the table in every single building. Now that’s relational
systems change from the inside out. Roughly twenty per cent of
the population now own homes that were built by the government.
Think about that when thinking about how to respond to
Lismore’s floods. Climate change will make this a recurring
problem. Part of the Singapore model I dig is the long lease.
That means the buildings will last. Ask yourself: how many of the
homes and apartment being built in Australia right now will still be
standing in ninety-nine years?

Back in Lismore, my sis said to me on the run, ‘Thousands of
houses could end up going here, and people wanna stay on their
home Country, they don’t wanna move.’
How do you stay fixed on Country that is so volatile? I took the
question to the Indigenous Knowledge Systems Lab and the crew
asked in response, what is a home? What about tiny homes that
move with the weather? Think about true social and economic
mobility – think about mobile homes. Pick up your home and drive
up the hill. There’s designers that can spin up modular tiny homes
for AU$6K a pop. We could see Indigenous people in Australia
build tiny home communities in national parks and look after the
land. Invite the neighbours affected by floods to another nation,
open up the currently held crown land, move with the seasons,
follow the songlines.
They say never waste a crisis. Let’s use this crisis to redesign
our economic patterns and behaviours. What do you reckon,
Airbnb?
From Lismore, let’s head over to New York.
I’ve spent a lot of riding kilometres on Citi Bikes, which you
hire at one place, ride, and drop off at another place, in a model
replicated in many cities.
In 2017 Dad visited us in New York and we had a great
adventure when I group-booked some Citi Bikes. We left our street
in Queens, rode across the Pulaski Bridge in Greenpoint, then rode
on to check out the Whitney Museum of American Art. On our
way into Manhattan we rode across the Williamsburg Bridge, and
I remember looking back at Dad battling away on that long slow
incline. The memory is indelible; I loved Citi Bike in that moment
because not only did it help me relate to the city in a different way,it gave me a moment of magic with my dad, in movement, that I’ll
never ever forget.
But I don’t love them so much anymore. Group hires are
gone. If I was to do that now, Dad would have to open up his own
account. You know the drill – stick your hands up and give us all
your personal information. They removed the capacity to bring
people together, just so they could get your data. I lost part of
my love of Citi Bike when they made us relate only as individuals;
before they had elements of a relational economy, potential for
UNC×5, now it’s back to the same old, one person, one card,
one company, one transaction.
That’s not the way to win the future.
The prize of the next century will go to those who defy the
pressure to take it all. It will go to those who design for us all.
I want to take us back to the painting for this chapter to help
us zoom out through the relational goop. That painting is always
moving, all the time, as close as I could get to getting life onto
a canvas – flows, interlinks, breaks, connects, remakes. Always
looping and feeding back. All of it, in relation.
And when we look in big zoom-out ways and see it all, then
nothing is ever out of context. Everything fits wherever it is, and
when things change and move around, it all fits again. When we
look at life in relation, we get a much deeper perspective and the
chance to expand the spaces and places where we shape value.
The next section of this book is about designing a digital nation
state. But first a word on Aboriginal nation states, and in particular
the one I’m a part of, Bundjalung.
It’s worth a quick search of the Aboriginal map of Australia
to see that Australia is a continent like Europe, with more than
155156
Hoodie EconomicsRelations
200 nations, all with different language groups – these nation
states still hold as we have never ceded the land. This framework
of showcasing and explaining our nations through English words
helps others value our existence – but the maps of the linear
borders of the nations aren’t as impressive to me as the relations
to flow, the relations to nature, to listening, to moving. The maps
I find inspiring are almost invisible to the eye. These maps are the
maps to the stars and to the Earth, to all the creatures, to what’s
before, mapped in songlines and through other forms of story. The
mapping is everywhere all the time, and that’s what I’m connected
to: people who map everything they can and everything they can
imagine, who try to see and feel the way by listening.
We are told that part of our Aboriginality is the connection
to the specific land where we are from. To our nation. And I hear
many people reflect on going home to Country feeling peaceful
and calm. That doesn’t happen for me. In my nation state, my
Aboriginal family was massacred. Only a few survived. I went back
there when I was a kid, as Mum was connecting back to Country.
When I was ten I went there for a year. I developed epilepsy, had
fits. I missed Dad and struggled to fit into school, but this was
something deeper. I’d feel ghosts dancing in my nightmares. I’d feel
the sickness – I believe the sickness I could feel was the massacre.
When I go back to that part of Bundjalung Country, to Lionsville,
I feel sick.
I told Mum when I went back that I don’t feel good there.
She understood.
The place where I feel most connected to Aboriginal people,
is, lo and behold, not a place, it’s in the relations – it’s when
I’m with Aboriginal people, when we are together in any place.
We are enhanced in each other’s presence, in our custodianship,in our energy and our being. We help each other see more, by
bringing each other the perspective of those that look at the
biggest possible view. I want to dig into the maybes to understand
that the richness is in the middle of the absolutes. Here’s a
few maybes.
Maybe there’s some people who like home, and some people
who like to roam? Maybe 20,000 years ago a youngster said,
‘I’m outta here,’ and adventured? Maybe our world can be a
modern set of songlines, the whole world? Maybe Indigenous
Australians can build custodial relations and patterns and health
and wealth around the world? Maybe we can move? And that
doesn’t make us any less Indigenous, or proud, or strong.
Our relations adapt. Our relations energise. Our relations move.
No one should ever feel trapped by relations, we should feel freed.
And maybe those relations are mine to help restore in
Lionsville, or maybe the world at large is where I’m born. Maybe we
do need to return, and maybe we can move; maybe both can have
value? Maybe we’re part of the sickness by not working through
the healing on the land? Maybe it’s time to move on? Maybe
our next 20,000 years’ of family story could have other roots
or shapes?
I’m playing this out to show that any fixed rule is flawed. Even
the systems in which I have seen the richest adaptation and
value have inherited patterns, and I think we must consider and
think about the patterns and our context before wholly accepting
everything as a rule. We must not be unthinking. Anything that
doesn’t allow for evolution and adaptation, in the face of change,
isn’t alive.
As we shape our ongoing design of life on Earth, if we allow
ourselves to embrace fluidity in our being, and release ourselves
157Hoodie Economics
from fixed states of temporal control, of permanence, then we
can realise that everything is built on what’s come before. And we
grow, we don’t divide and fight and yell, we be, we act, we listen,
we learn, we give-give, and we receive-receive.
And it’s with that spirit, of movement beyond place, in tradition
being fixed and fluid, in rules being right and wrong, in life being
everything and nothing – it’s with that spirit that we look to shape
a network that can be as healthy as possible, a network named
after the behaviour that gives us the most flow and movement as a
species, and that is IMAGI-NATION.

What’s the economy in the network?
Hoodie Economics – a relational economy that reminds us that
human nature at its healthiest is in a constant flow of exchanges
of time, knowledge and opportunity between other humans and
the natural world. The economy in IMAGI-NATION is anchored
to nature. For example, we have cultural indicator species that
every participant in the network is linked to, and are encouraging
imagination minutes by returning people to nature. Ultimately all
the IP of IMAGI-NATION will be gifted back to nature.

When COVID hit in 2020, I had an idea calling, of a parallel system
of living in the internet, a digital nation. Not a digital world to run
away from Earth, but a place that is connected in relation to Earth,
that gives us the chance to alter some of the established rules and
patterns that we’ve inherited, a lab to test different designs around
relations and access our best collective intelligence to help all of
humanity soar in sync with the rest of the natural world.
When the world was closed during the pandemic, we had
school online, we had work online (if we were lucky), we walked
through the computer into the world. Never before has the internet
been so critical and the network nature of life so visible. Suddenly
the virtual world, metarealities, metaverses were mainstream.
And everything in my body said, go now!
I could see everything stopping, and the rules and structures
that had got us here freezing. Amid the pain and suffering, there
was a chance to design a newer world in this frozen moment of
time, a chance to reboot some of the economic models that we
had inherited, to shift some of the legacy values we have taken for
granted, a chance to move the status quo.
When the pandemic hit, we flipped our whole organisation into
a daily TV show, running live on YouTube, in just four days. We
invited all sorts from across the world into the conversation, kids
and prime ministers, artists and engineers, government leaders
and philosophers, environmental activists and economists. Our TV
show became our lab of unlikely connections. We created a hoodie
that paid rent – hoodie sales raised $20,000 for people struggling
to pay rent at the start of the pandemic.
There was so much pain, we couldn’t stop, we had to keep
inventing. I asked our team: what have we always wanted to doand never had the chance to? We either write the story, or we play
our part in someone else’s story.
Firstly, we decided we wanted to make a feature film with
imagination as the driver, not $$. IMAGINE: The Feature Film is
currently sitting with producers in LA, who are considering a
worldwide release.
Secondly, we decided we wanted to build a free and open
university. IMAGI-NATION {Uni} opened in 2021, a university for
all, free to everyone, because higher order thinking should be
universally available. We focused on the university having a core
purpose – to create a fairer world.
We organised our students into five course areas, identifying
five key players in our societal structures that impact the outcome
of young people. The first degree was in entrepreneurship, to
give the stage to young people outside the margins to show they
ain’t a problem to be fixed, but the solution. The second was a
mentoring degree, training teachers in how to cross the line from
being lecturers to stand alongside students as mentors and look
out at the world together, and how to build bridges and unlikely
connections between the school and the world at large. The third
degree area was for university students to build mentoring bridges
to local high schools. The fourth was for executives to activate
their organisations to build mentoring bridges into local high
schools, and to develop a co-CEO model to level the playing field
in the boardroom and fast track the connection of intelligence
from outside the margins into the mainframe. The final degree area
was for citizens to work on their own project for change.
We based the tutorial groups on our UNC×5 algorithm, so each
group had one representative from a different sphere. We believed
167168
Hoodie EconomicsIMAGI-NATION
this cross-pollination of intelligence would have as much of an
effect as anything we would teach.
But who would our professors be?
I’d been here before. In 2017, after AIME had started up in
Uganda and South Africa, I was the point person, trying to bring
the workshops to life via video. Around that time, I found myself in
the permanent Jim Henson exhibition in New York’s Museum of the
Moving Image (where Yael was filming Orange Is the New Black).
I reckon I went there twenty times while we lived there, and after
getting over my jealousy of Jim’s body of work, on the fourth visit I
sat head in hands wondering how the heck to communicate to the
world, and then Elmo whispered, It’s me, you idiot.
This was the trapdoor from the impossible hero’s journey or
founder worship, this was how I could focus on the knowledge, this
was the way to live in imagination. Puppets.
Within each course were six knowledge fields as key
theoretical components. Professor Hope, the puppet I worked
with, became the Professor of Imagination. Professor Blue, based
in LA, became the Professor of Flipping the Script, with a keen
focus on the ocean and the power of waves. Professor Energy,
based in Pretoria, became the Professor of Mentoring. Professor
Asterix, based in London, became the Professor of Hoodie
Economics, obsessed with how we can use the metaphor and
act of cooking to make sense of economic movement. Professor
Lionolcorn, who tours the world, became our Professor of
Organising Change, with a particular interest in nature. Finally, Prof
Einstein became the Professor of Building Bridges, with a specific
focus on the bridges between Earth and the internet.
We had our puppets – thanks to puppeteers extraordinaire
Vanessa Ellis (Ness) and Heath McIvor. We had our frame, andmadly I wrote and created alongside a troupe of wonderful
people in our team and around the world to build a platform in
four months.
We had a university. We had a TV network and feature film
in motion. We had a fashion line. We had our labs. But I knew we
needed something more, something to house them, an economy
that could bring all of this together. We needed a currency, a place
of exchange, to make this relational network scale. I felt this was
the moment to press ‘go’ on the creation of a new digital country
for the world.
I booked a date for May 2022, called in favours, and then went
all in on the vision. After yarning with Tyson Yunkaporta on his
podcast, things became clearer, and we gathered a crew to nut
this out. The invite read as follows:
Come and hear our plans to bring together an alliance of
wonderful organisations and human beings to design a new nation,
an online country called IMAGI-NATION, that models a different
economy and is a home for kids pushed outside the margins to
walk across a bridge into knowledge and opportunities, and a
space for citizens of our Earth to work out how to live and design
a world more equitably.
At the event, Tyson talked first, then me, and we wove through
the elements of the nation, before breaking off into smaller groups.
At the end of the session we set a simple challenge: if you want
to do the work with us, if you’ve made a commitment, then grab a
hoodie, an IMAGI-NATION{Founder} hoodie, and you are a founder
of IMAGI-NATION. Let’s go build it.
When people took the hoodie without purchasing it, they
had signed a contract with us. Hoodie Economics in play – our
169Hoodie EconomicsIMAGI-NATION
smart contract. Hiten Somalia, the CEO of textile manufacturer
Simba Global, donated 50,000 hoodies and said, ‘I’ll back this
platform to change the world and invest in Hoodie Economics.’
Hoodies are our coins, our soul tokens, and will be unlocked along
the way as the physical manifestation showcasing the currency of
citizens’ time in relation between IMAGI-NATION and Planet Earth.
The knowledge, the relations and the memories from IMAGI-
NATION will be woven into the hoodie, so that the person wearing
it can be inspired to keep building relational economic behaviour
throughout their life cycle on our blue dot.
The country design today, as it’s about to spin up, is very close
to what we sketched at the start. This is one of the original designs:We were building on what we already knew and had. So
now we just had to create the platform and weave it together.
Simple right? Yeah, well then we found ourselves asking questions
like: How do you start a country? How do you form it? What role
is the hoodie playing? Is it a currency? Who are the leaders?
What is the culture? What are the rules of behaviour? How do
you respond to possible corruption? What happens if it becomes
powerful beyond control? Do we want control?
A long pandemic year and a bit later, I’m writing this book after
wandering through the library of life to explore all the questions
under the questions.
To find the answers, I’ve followed the lead of that first yarn with
Tyson, and we’ve done so much of it in relation with others. I’ve
danced with hundreds of canvases, with questions, books, films,
other species, all yarns, all weaves, layering and layering, unfurling
madly. Channelling the oral tradition of 60,000+ years of yarning
and weaving that my ancestors have practised on this very land
I type this book on.
Talking of canvases – when I painted this chapter, I put a
canvas down in the Ethic office in Tribeca, NYC, and invited people
170

to add to it, and they did, from a seven-year-old through to a
seventy-year-old, people from four different continents added to
this piece, just scratching the surface of imagination and networks,
and what revealed itself is a web. Any section isolated would lose
its being, it is all interconnected and in movement.
From the painting back into the design process of searching
for answers to some of the biggest questions: we were betting on
unlikely connections to be the web that tied the nation together,
just like the way the painting for this chapter was created. We
believed this process was the key investment area so we went
head on into an unlikely connections design experience, lining up
fifty one-hour co-design sessions with fifty unlikely connections,
moving across ten countries, from a teenage entrepreneur in India,
to a former prime minister of Australia, to a writer in Kenya, to one
of the leading global producers of immersive theatre in LA.
It was bonkers. After eight co-design sessions, we found
ourselves with a menu for change as the frame, using the
metaphor of AIME as a restaurant.
We were in the midst of a design session with Malcolm
Turnbull, former Australian prime minister, who stopped me and
said: ‘Jack, I don’t understand what you’re talking about. Don’t you
guys do mentoring? What does this have to do with a restaurant?
And you’ve lost me on the network and the nation.’ And then we
stopped and worked through it, and by the end Malcolm said, ‘Yep,
I can see how a relationship between a kid in a remote community
and a business person in New York could make a difference.’
Another design gauntlet laid out the bridge between the
imagined and the real. I didn’t see a bridge, I saw them as one and
the same – that both enhanced the other. Thanks to a suggestion
by the chair of our AIME US organisation, Chris Bartlett, a formerbusiness professor at Harvard, we had a decision to make: go back
to the literal, or dive deeper into the imagined.
And as we were searching for an answer to the question, we
received it from an unlikely connection.
Our breakthrough moment came from a session with Greg
Hutchinson, who has worked at Bain and Company helping coach
leaders around the world. He said, ‘It would really help me if there
was a story here to tie it together, a person who was experiencing
this restaurant in IMAGI-NATION. Maybe they are a sceptic, from a
business world, from inside the margins.’
And so we created Stuart Reeves, a businessman who receives
a dinner invitation to a restaurant that’s ‘across the border, in
IMAGI-NATION, and the dinner is at the restaurant ROCKET – a
night of unlikely connections’. Fighting back his instinct to say
no, he accepts. And with that, we were on our way, all in on
imagination.
Life is story, one big story, and over those fifty hours, a story
found us, co-written by all of these people, and the story was
finished as A Night in IMAGI-NATION, which we turned into a
hardcopy book. Now is it imagined or real? Once we had a story
we were alive, we started to find our way through, we had guests
joining and building the plot points, we were seeing more clearly
what the nation looked like.
Our co-designers were all on board. Martin Lotti from Nike
could see this as the chance for a network for good. Kristine Dery,
a research scientist from MIT who focuses on how companies
work, pointed out that companies all over the world recognised
that learning is most effective in groups, which is just what we had
hit on. Cameron Adams, a co-founder of the design tool Canva,
saw it all like a Tarantino movie, threads everywhere that get tied
173174
Hoodie EconomicsIMAGI-NATION
together at the end. Chalon Bridges, CEO of the non-profit Hello
World, encouraged us to keep feeding the complexity. We danced
with Kunal Chandiramani, a young entrepreneur from India, and
young African American leaders such as Jacqueline Twillie, founder
of women’s leadership program ZeroGap, who inspired us to take
the program into the sensory space (smell/restaurant). We hung
out with former Indigenous mentees from Australia like Rhian
Miller and Drew Paten, and also Fulbright Scholar Adam Davids.
It was remarkable to see all these different people embrace a
process of emergence – we could feel the flow growing.
One quick lesson from this I’d love to share – imagination is a
precious life, every imagining is a newborn, fragile before it can
even sit by itself alone for a moment. It needs love and attention.
And this imagination is killed at birth ruthlessly by grown-ups
every single day. I learned through this process to not be broken
by grown-ups, to keep imagining, and to not apologise for birthing
imaginative life.
As this was all transpiring, Tyson and Johny Mair evolved to
become two of the core unlikely connections externally from
AIME to anchor the movement of the design intelligence that
was coming at us from all quarters. The Indigenous Knowledge
Systems Lab through Tyson brought huge intelligence, and Johny’s
network kept informing whether this could actually cut through to
those deep inside the system and pass for example the financial
advisor’s sceptic test. And then we found Ben Johnson, co-founder
of Josephmark design studio in Brisbane, and the Josephmark
team came on board to build the thing. Together we yarned –
heaps; we worked through UNC×5 as our algorithm; we spoke of
the need of an endpoint to guard against institutionalisation and
decay, we spoke of sharing the IP and all the learnings.Once more Tyson made an unlikely connection on his podcast
where we did an episode called ‘Processes of Emergence’ with
Fritjof Capra, a systems thinker, theoretical physicist, ecologist
and best-selling author (his most recent book is The Systems
View of Life) who’s been working in the field for five decades plus.
Full of knowledge and wisdom, he encouraged our work as work
that hasn’t been done before and that spoke to the fact that
all problems are interconnected – and that none can be solved
in isolation.
Consistent with our thinking, Capra went on to define four
elements that he saw as characteristics of life, from the smallest
organism to the largest – thinking that helped us along the way:
1. Wherever we see life, we see networks. The networks are
self-organising – their structures are not determined by
forces outside, but are organised by the systems itself.
2. Life is inherently regenerative, from the turning of the seasons
to a cell constantly regenerating its molecules. When an
organism dies, the molecular structures do not disappear;
the piece of dead wood has exactly the same amount of DNA
it had as a living tree, but what has stopped is the process
of regeneration.
3. Life is inherently creative – confirmed recently in complexity
theory. Living organisms are able to maintain themselves in
a state of balance, adapting, for example, to hot weather and
freezing temperatures. Every now and again the organism
will encounter points of instability, and the whole system
may break down and die. But often what happens instead
of a breakdown is a breakthrough, to a new state of order.
175Hoodie EconomicsIMAGI-NATION
Out of instability or crisis comes a new state of order. This is
the underlying characteristic of the creativity of nature at all
levels.3. The nation is nature – it’s taking Indigenous relational mapping
4. Life is inherently intelligent. A radical new concept of the
systems view is that the mind is not a thing but a process.
It’s the core of the process of continual regeneration. All
living organisms respond to their environments in specific
ways – and these are cognitive responses. Because of this
special cognitive response to the environment, we can call
all organisms intelligent.
Following this yarn with Capra, I had an even deeper feeling
of IMAGI-NATION’s regenerative nature. I could see how we
were designing with death, with networked complexity, with
imagination.
Next challenge was around investment and measurement.
We were flowing through a river on a boat with Johny Mair to
explore ideas around linking the money to the relations that have
helped people make their money, and to then explore the relational
input that could evolve from IMAGI-NATION by allowing others
to develop new unlikely connections to elevate their thinking,
status, agency.
As we wrestled with the return for the investor, six anchor
points emerged about IMAGI-NATION:
1. It’s a return on relations.
2. It’s a lab that can generate tools – like a tool for organisations
systems, weaving that with modern systems of organising,
modelled on other natural design networks like mycelium,
and in doing so helping us relate to one of Planet Earth’s most
marginalised participants: nature.
4. It’s a lab to solve problems with imagination.
5. It models an economy that centres intelligence from outside
the margins, builds mini collective units, and focuses on
exchanges of time, knowledge and opportunities.
6. It’s unlikely – it connects people not to who and what they
know, but to who they don’t know and what they don’t know,
and in doing so undoes major problems created by social
media: the affirmation of bias and the division of humanity.
Tyson suggested we had to go out before we came back in,
to split into men’s and women’s business, so we channeled aunty
and uncle yarn sessions. We fused Bronwyn Bancroft (AIME
founding board director and my magical mother), Kristy Grieves,
Rhian Miller, Irmin Durand, Kristine Dery and Steph Beck in the
Aunty Yarns, and then in the Uncle Yarns we connected Tyson with
Ben Johnson, Chris Baker and Freedom Cheteni.
The knowledge unfurled and wove wildly, and it would be too
much to list here because words often fail complexity, but art
doesn’t. LUNA TUNES jumped in the game and visualised the
intelligence from the Aunty/Uncle Yarns, which you can see on the
next pages.
to test the strength of their relations, which can in turn improve
the outcomes and health of that organisation.

From there, we landed on five central promises to build a digital
state:
1. Relations that value everyone’s intelligence
2. Knowledge: free tools for free minds
3. Networking: unlikely connections for a fairer world
4. Imagination that powers unlikely connections, relations and
knowledge
5. Actionable projects that create change
As we came towards the pointy end of the design process we
had to ask, if the money is hoodies, how is it valued – as money
or currency? How does the money move? How is it banked?
What’s the bank look like? How is the economy stimulated by
the bank? Following these questions led me into a rabbit hole
digesting operating processes for reserve banks and I needed air,
so reached out once more to yarn and try find the weave. This time
it was with Paul Kearney and Tyson. During the exploration Tyson
said, ‘What about the Re-Serve Bank? Not based on debt, but on
enhancing relations, not lending, but stimulating. About human
service, about banking our relations and valuing the process not
the outcome, the relational not transactional.’
Banks facilitate growth through lending. It’s a debt frame.
Our bank doesn’t send people into debt. It will focus on increasing
healthy relations, and on relational credit. This network is not a
Web3 project detached from Planet Earth, but one that weaves
with notes into our existing economic playgrounds and helps fuse
exchanges at pace without some of the existing restrictions – in
simple terms, how we bank the credit and can exchange it for time,
knowledge, opportunities, goods and services.
180
IMAGI-NATION
With the Re-Serve banking frame anchored we felt we had
the home run to round out the design. We build on weaves and
circles, we let the knowledge feed the system, and then power it
via relations.
In the heart of the nation lies the Knowledge Tree.
Through the Knowledge Tree, we believe we can solve the big
problems of today and tomorrow – or at the very least activate
new intelligence into the solutions.
The tree has three branches:
1. Co-created knowledge
2. A platform that profiles organisations using imagination and
creating a fairer world
3. Jalngay – a Bundjalung word from my nation for the fire and
the reflection of fire; you create a fire through an imaginative
spark, or be a reflection to someone else’s imaginative spark
IMAGI-NATION is a complex ecosystem – a new type of nation,
where everyone is welcome. It’s an intentional network – open to
all who want to do the work to solve the challenges of our time.
The next image shows how the nation’s design has
evolved. Instead of building top down, we went from the bottom
of the Earth, from the core of two of the world’s oldest systems of
intelligence: Indigenous Australian systems and mycelium.
181IMAGI-NATION
Some of the things we hope IMAGI-NATION could achieve in the
next ten years include:
One million IMAGI-NATION presidents from outside the
margins have the network of IMAGI-NATION work with them
to bring their visions to life.
Relational maps woven into one thousand-plus schools,
universities, organisations and citizens.
One million-plus meaningful deep unlikely connections that
change the way the world works.
Ten-plus systems change projects that solve the challenges
of our time.
Model a relational network, focused on the power of the
internet to engage in parallel economic exchange, taking
intelligence from outside the margins and plugging it into
the system at large.
Leave behind tools.
We’ve thought about what we are leaving behind because we
have been from the outset working towards the intentional death
of IMAGI-NATION ten years after it comes to life, which we’ll work
through in the next and last chapter.
We don’t want to own human beings’ time or data; we want
to connect, re-ignite our individual and collective imagination,
and inspire people to head back into their lives with more energy
and joy, more tools to make unlikely connections, more valuing
of diverse views and knowledge, and the impetus to build a
fairer world.
We believe IMAGI-NATION can provide the intentional
space to release the potential of the internet, of Web3, of the
metaverse, to build a stage for young people outside the margins
to ‘create and dream and live in ways they cannot in their real
183184
Hoodie EconomicsIMAGI-NATION
lives’ (as virtual reality pioneer Louis Rosenberg put it), and
extend that experience to those inside the margins, stuck in an
inherited system.
As Richard Bartle, AI expert and virtual-world designer formerly
of Essex University, said, ‘To design a virtual world is perhaps the
greatest act of creative imagination there can be.’ I feel deeply
excited to get to model some of the dreams of the cats at Essex
University in 1977 working on virtual worlds for the first time, to
see if we can come closer to the vision of equality thanks to the
internet. In working together to design a new system we can learn
from the failings of our current models, build on their strengths, and
with our collective imagination build a virtual lab to inform design in
our real world, to create a fairer world, in sync with nature. And that
was what we had to weave in as part of our final design challenge,
we had to find a way for nature to guide us.
As we cascaded down the mountain towards the finish line
of the IMAGI-NATION design process, we searched for the
governance, for ‘rite way’ for humans, and of course like all great
lessons, it’s beyond us. Our greatest teachers are non-humans;
our greatest guides, our anchor points, our flow, our mentors, our
libraries – they are stored in nature, twenty billion billion animals.
Yarning with Tyson, the Josephmark team, and Arthur Little,
Steph Beck, Sam Refshauge and Ben Knight from AIME, we
decided to anchor our governance to relations with the health of
nature. We want to re-establish humankind’s role as a custodial
species and to remind ourselves that nature is our library, our
anchor, our reason for being. We want to show how nature keeps
score on our value as human beings, on our time on Earth. We
want to bring humanity together and unearth human potential,intelligence and joy. When we are together looking out at nature,
we are in healthy human relation. Beyond us binds us.
Climate change is the battle of our times. We must think
about how to move from preservation to valuation of nature’s
intelligence, how we could gift our IP or resources back to nature.
And recognise on the balance sheet nature’s IP contribution to us.
As a species, we are great when we have a common pursuit
beyond ourselves, whether it’s saving the ozone layer, putting
a man on the moon or developing a COVID vaccine. Making
IMAGIN-NATION work is the same – it’s us looking out, beyond our
own selves. Maybe in time governments will add nature’s health
and wealth as a reckoner in the budget, alongside the wellbeing of
humans index. When our collective pursuit is the health of nature,
we release ourselves from our opposition to each other and
remember who we are. Imagination frees us and nature anchors
us. Imagination allows us to think, to play, to move, to travel, while
nature guides us across the maps.
People think the way to fix the problem of poverty is to ‘help
the poor’. That’s not the way. People don’t need help, they need
a role. And it turns out many who are considered poor in our
financial capital system have a long DNA of healthy relations to
nature. We have deep relational capital. Centre nature, then we
centre intelligence from outside the margins. We aren’t spending
so much time on how we set the table for people of different
colour and who sits where; instead, we are out by the fire, near the
tree, by the lake, getting to work.
We have to look to the trees, the rivers, the birds, as so many
Indigenous people have worked out for thousands of years, to
know where IMAGI-NATION is headed. Our totemic maps move us
185from each other towards animals, and our yarns weave us into the
land, the water, the sky.
The point is not simply preserving old knowledge; we must also
be open to emerging knowledge. Uncle/nephew. That’s where the
monsters and mashups, like my totem, the platypus, can show us
different ways forward. Like the giant opossum I saw in a New York
garbage can. Nature adapts, new life emerges. It’s in nature that
we die and are reborn, in nature that the energy stays finite and
balanced. When we see ourselves as Earth’s servants, then we see
our death as a part of our life, and nature as our safe that holds
onto our life’s work. Nature is the conductor that looks after the
orchestra – and passes on the notes after we’ve gone.DEATH
It’s dark outside. I’m in a plane, 30,000 feet above the Pacific
Ocean. It’s been dark for a while. We are tracking the moon,
I think. It’s a long night, a time-space bend – fourteen hours in the
air, but when I land in Sydney the calendar will say it’s two days
since I left the US.
I’m looking back at the two weeks I have just spent in
New York. Tyson Yunkaporta and I were helping design a nature
fund, and presenting our dreams for the future to big-time big-
money investors. We have been weaving Indigenous-informed
systemic processes into the onboarding experience for investors.
I think we are on the verge of busting open Indigenous value
and worth, centring our intelligence, letting us enter the room
as rich, joyful, generous designers, looking outward beyond our
horizons, helping humanity recover our natural way – our way as
custodial species.
This was a moment.

Hoodie EconomicsDeath
As part of this trip I’m remembering our weekend together
with Ethic and AIME in upstate New York. On the first morning
of the weekend our crew gathered for breakfast and passed
around meat in plastic and duck liver pate in a can. Soon after, a
real life deer presented itself to Tyson and Arthur Little, my AIME
bro. Tyson accepted the life of the deer, and brought many of the
people there into the experience, into the the process, touching,
feeling and thanking the deer for the life transference, intentionally
connecting with death in the process of cooking the meal. I
imagined myself a few hundred years hence, with the deer now
become our totem, our modern songline; the deer’s death had
united us, and changed our relation to the meat in plastic and liver
in tin. If you eat meat, this is the rite way.As the plane ploughs through the night sky, I’m thinking back
on the deep relations we built with some of the biggest wealth
advisors and investors in the US, who engaged deeply on the topic
of organisational death (I’m coming to that) and could see the
need for it as a design principle in organisational strategy. Some
even declared in the meetings how they’d like to start immediately
advising some of their clients to move towards this process. I’m
thinking about how empowering it would feel for so many leaders
to have a destination, to release and pass it on.
I’m thinking of the design gift that landed in my lap the month
before, riding the train from Thirroul towards Sydney’s Circular
Quay after finishing philosopher and ex-Google strategist James
Williams’ 2018 book, Stand Out of Our Light. The lesson he
taught me was to make sure our network was not addictive, not
manipulating people, not making them need and want more of us.
Getting off that train, I looked out at the water of Sydney
Harbour, imagining the feelings that ripped through my ancestors
when the British ships first rolled in, and the feelings of other
ancestors of mine on those ships. I imagined all the trees on the
harbour witnessing that moment. I felt life’s complexity. My mind
was filled with family, past and present, with thoughts of their
lives, and their deaths. I was thinking about Jane Goodall, working
all her life to pass on hope to us all, to pass on the energy, Tyson,
Pemau – the one today and the other one from a long time ago. I
thought about Mum’s life, her paintings, her worlds, I thought about
Dad, how I’ll miss Mum and Dad when they die, and how happy I
am they’ve lived. I felt my family. I felt humanity.
I immediately called Ben Johnson, a co-builder of IMAGI-
NATION. ‘Bro, I don’t want it to be so rich inside IMAGI-NATION
191192
Hoodie EconomicsDeath
that people forget their own imagination. If people really want
to go into IMAGI-NATION, let’s make it focused for a short time,
maximum one year. On the outside walls of IMAGI-NATION, let’s
invite people to not come in. Remind them that imagination is with
them right now, and invite them to make an imagination minutes
pledge – ask them to turn off their screens and take back their
time. We shouldn’t create networks that steal their time, we should
be gifting it back.’
Ultimately that’s the role of the mentor – to be a mentor, not a
saviour. To build the other’s capacity to be stronger without you.
To let the relationship pass and die, regrow, regenerate, relate
beyond you.
When I got to painting this chapter, I wasn’t thinking death
as the end, I was thinking of it as never-ending beginning-end-
beginning. Thinking five ways: /\\/–. I was thinking of it as
abundance. Of released energy. Of processes that allow us to find
joy in life by intentionally preparing for death. I saw brightness.
I saw hope. I saw nature. I saw reality. I saw that through staring at
a space that could be dark and scary that we can look through the
darkness and see magic, colour, light.
Death is challenging. It hurts. It’s sad. It’s also inevitable.
So how do we design with knowledge of death? With a focus on
death? Just as we centre nature as our scorekeeper, could we
make death an anchor point as a design process for life? Could we
anchor our organisations more securely with an intentional death
strategy for life to emerge, for regeneration?
Have you ever looked at your ancestry? Ances-tree? The family
tree, the tree linking your life to the lives of those that have come
before? Have you ever felt the DNA of life inside you – the longcontinuum, the DNA that we share with other animals, have you
listened to the long long story stored inside you?
AIME, for example, would not exist without the groups that ran
the civil rights movements. It wouldn’t exist without me going to St
Paul’s College and working out how to communicate with people
inside the system, to understand the system. My grandfather
couldn’t go to school; I was invited to Australia’s oldest university
on a scholarship. IMAGI-NATION wouldn’t exist without all the
work of all the social networks to date. All those bends and sways
of the branches.
Tolkien’s trees from Lord of the Rings popped into my mind,
and I was wondering: how do trees stand up? My daughter Pemau
answered the question for me: ‘It’s the roots, Dad.’
Yes, our roots, which cling to the Earth, which connect the
treetops to the underground mycelium networks and thus to all
the other trees. Until the roots give way and the tree falls, when it
becomes a home to all the creatures that will live in it and all that
life is given back to the Earth.
Death is natural. Knowledge of death makes life infinitely richer.
The strongest cultures have a long connection to death and the
passing on of knowledge. When we ignore death it becomes a
ghost, a shadow, a dangerous space. When we dismiss death,
we dismiss life. When we know life is going to end, we savour it.
We open our hearts up and feel.
When designing, the greatest intelligence can be gleaned
from the most natural realities. Why would we not design with
death in mind when it’s one of the only anchor points that apply
to everything on Earth? Humans prepare for death – shouldn’t
organisations too? All organisations eventually die anyway.
193194
Hoodie EconomicsDeath
When it’s not intentional, they institutionalise, lose their spirit and
energy, get corrupted, implode, explode or fade into irrelevance.
To walk the talk on this philosophy, I proposed to our
organisation that not only should IMAGI-NATION have an
intentional death strategy and destination, AIME should also.
In 2022, after spending time in Marrickville exploring a new
potential head office for AIME with the former chair of our board
Tom Dery, I took the time to share the idea of intentional death
with him. Then I rode the train from Sydney back to Thirroul, and
my soul started to scream for me to make this happen. I’d been
thinking about AIME’s death since we started, never wanting
to be a forever group, and I’d been thinking about intentional
death for the organisation for at least four years – now it was
time to see if I could make it real. I formulated my thoughts for
consideration for the AIME board of directors.
The death of an organisation can be exactly like the death
of a person. We take knowledge for granted while the holders
are still alive; the foreknowledge of death brings urgency. If we
declare our organisation’s death ten years out, it will have the
same effect as when you know a family member is going to die –
we suddenly race to quality time, knowing it is finite. When we
know it won’t be forever, we start to grow into the space that
will be left behind by that person, to embody their qualities, their
knowledge, and carry it on.
I could see the university filling up because there will only
ever be ten years. I could see IMAGI-NATION becoming a must-
visit because the show won’t roll on forever. I could see hoodies
becoming collector items. I could see others talking up our mission
when we are gone. I could see the explosion of the AIME star
at its end sending stardust across the Earth to be collected inthis generation and for many to come, in the form of documented
knowledge and tools.
Those questions I had been asking myself – how to prevent
the decay, corruption and institutionalisation of AIME; how to
prevent IMAGI-NATION becoming bigger than all of us, unruly,
staff everywhere, a cash cow, always with updates and new
design features, with trade secrets to protect – had their answer:
intentional death.
Likewise for the questions on the other side of that coin: how
could we create urgency? How could we create the largest systemic
change? Was it through building our own empire, or designing from
natural design? Could we hand over the notes and let it go?
The only way I could see forward was to intentionally die.
One frosty Sydney winter evening, I was having a follow-up
session with Tom Dery over coffee in a hotel lobby in Darling
Harbour discussing all this. Tom said, ‘When I was at business
school, I had this brilliant professor who at one point in the course
turned to us all and said: “Businesses have one imperative, survival.”’
We spoke of Facebook as an example, and Tom said, ‘Facebook will
have a natural death. It will come to an end when it’s right, and you
can see how that is starting to happen now.’
I responded, ‘They won’t die a natural timed death if their only
business imperative is survival.’
No organisation on Earth should last forever.
There are two natural laws, life and death.
In the space I work in – social change – there should be an even
faster intentional acceleration towards death as a design feature for
organisations. As Jacqueline Twillie, one of our 2022
co-CEOs, wrote to me, ‘When you become part of the status quo,
you become part of the system maintaining its power structures.’
195Hoodie EconomicsDeath
Death is not simply the end: you do it so you can pass on the
notes, the tools for others to use. For AIME I imagine some of
the tools we’ll leave behind are a mentor class for schools, an
imagination curriculum for education ministers, our example of
how to use internet TV streaming to connect students to the
rest of the world, and of using fashion for good. We’ll leave an
example of how to develop intelligence from outside the margins
and to employ Indigenous knowledge systems, shifting how we
shape investments into nature, and our global economy. And all of
our code will be knowledge shared, open-sourced so others can
borrow and build on the baseline we’ve worked on. Of course, all
this lives on in the thousands of alumni.
I had a yarn about this to one of AIME’s founding members and
still serving board director, my mum, Bronwyn Bancroft. ‘I think the
deadline enlivens people to move,’ she said. ‘It’s peculiar because
many of us never even talk about death, but I think it’s necessary,
and yes it’s the tools we leave behind, but it’s also the energy we
bring to the time we have.’the way. Chris Wirasinha spoke about passing on knowledge
to other organisations, potentially accelerating change. Helen
Wiseman shared her excitement, while Paul Kearney explored how
other organisations could also take up our model. Looking around
the cinema where we were holding the meeting, Tom Dery said,
‘This is the time for this.’
They put the proposal to a vote, and the AIME board endorsed
AIME’s intentional death strategy and ten-year countdown.
As far as I know, such a thing has never occurred before.
Staring at the roof of the old cinema, joy rushed through me
and my memory immediately took me back to New York and the
morning of 9 June 2022, sitting in a small park in Tribeca as the sun
rose, taking it all in before Johny would introduce Tyson and me
to some of the major financial players in the US. I looked up to the
Ethic office, five storeys up. My gaze went up to the trees, I felt
the ancestors with me, I felt I was on a cloud, in a flow of rite way,
and a huge ocean of breath exhaled out of my soul, carrying all
the pressure of this journey, the quest for understanding, the fight
for hope, the belief in you and in me, in us. When I exhaled, I felt
relief – and a sense of what might be next.
This is intentional death for system-wide relational health and
wealth. This is regeneration. This is an abundance mindset, this
is natural law, this is human beings designing our organisations
with reality anchored in our roots. This is about ances-tree and
the current-see. This is ceremony. This is human beings facing the
biggest reality of life – our death. We inherit everything, and this
move towards intentional death of organisations accelerates the
process of inheritance for those to come – ensuring they inherit
something in good health before corruption and decay set in.
We all die.
In September 2022, AIME’s board directors convened in our new
home base, the IMAGI-NATION{Factory}, an old cinema complex in
the Entertainment Quarter in Sydney. We were there to put AIME’s
intentional death strategy to a vote. As each director reflected
before casting their vote, I held my breath.
Kate Koch spoke of intentional death in university research,
which typically has a problem to solve and a timespan attached.
Bronwyn Bancroft spoke of the regenerative nature of this
process, as did John Davis. Ben Jones reflected that this was
196
197198
Hoodie EconomicsDeath
We live on in those we were in relations with.
We live on in knowledge and story passed on to others.
The best way to tell a story is to make sure there is an ending.
The best ending for your organisation is the one you intended.
The embrace of death is central to the design of the relational
networks that have sustained Indigenous systems in Australia
for 60,000+ years. The embrace of death has been central to
handing on the knowledge throughout those millennia. Central
for storing the knowledge in story, in the stars, in the ground, in
the rivers, in the animals, in song and dance and art. What we are
doing is shaping a pathway of energy continuum and flow for the
next 60,000 years. My vision is for the organisational strategy and
process of intentional death to spread throughout the world and
become one of Australia’s great exports.
Our goal at AIME has been reducing and removing inequity.
No one organisation can change the world alone, but we can light
a spark. If we are here forever, that means we have failed. If we
exit and pass on our work so that it is taken up by many more, we
have succeeded. We are building a strong platform and stage, then
making space for others to play the music.
Death is the outcome. Life is the process. Freedom is in
focusing on and valuing the process, not the outcome.
Declaring death in advance removes that sense that you are
keeping secrets to increase profit or success. There is no hidden
agenda when you have announced your own departure. It is
responsible, transparent and brave.
Death can reduce the fear of bankruptcy, which hobbles so
many organisations, making them wary of risk. The equation
changes when you have a deadline. Removing that fear unlocks
more potential.Death introduces urgency – it makes you want to try out and
spin up every great idea you might think you’ve ever had. No more
saving for a rainy day. Spend while the sun is shining.
Death removes the pretend permanence, the illusion of
perfection, the promise of eternity. When we stare death in the
face, we don’t have to pretend that our organisations are the
armour of our human frailty, that our jobs are our identity, that our
uniforms are who we are.
Death releases joy, which emerged while creating the painting
for this chapter. The painting whispering in my ear that there is no
greater reminder to live than death.
Death’s imminence makes you remember your inner child, the
imagination inside that originally sparked the mashup of unlikely
connections to make the organisation come to life.
And finally, foreknowledge of death lets you finish the story.
You get to capture the knowledge of what you’ve worked on, in
order to bequeath it. This is the greatest tool we can shape as a
species. The finished story.
This is the most important decade in human history – we gotta
change the way the world works or there just won’t be human
life on Earth – so throw your hat in the ring to go all in with your
organisation, then stardust the thing and let the magic sing now
and forever.
Every ending is a beginning.
I’m sad to end this book, it’s not got long left, and the prospect
also fills me with joy. It will never be finished of course; it’s yours
now, passed on to you, to do with what you will.
I’m joyous at the death ahead of AIME, enraptured by the
light on the hill, by putting both hands up and saying, ‘This is
the best we can do, the best one organisation can do, and
199Hoodie EconomicsDeath
not long from now we will step off the stage and hand over
the notes.’
This book encapsulates my life’s work to date. It’s felt inspiring
to have a purpose beyond myself, to be striving for us and not I.
And I suppose that is the whole point of this book – I wonder
what you’ll do next, what we’ll do next. I can’t wait to read the
next chapter.
After Donald Trump was elected president, my partner Yael
joined the Freedom Resistance Revival Choir. Some of the choir
organisers had put together the Women’s March on Washington in
2017. When they were thinking about what to do next, the singer
and civil rights leader Harry Belafonte said to them: ‘When the
music is strong, the movement is strong.’ Out of that the choir was
born. I’ll never forget Yael standing strongly, with Pemau growing
in her womb, alongside women of all shapes and sizes, in harmony,
singing in Times Square. This is one of the songs they sang, based
on an old Chinese saying:Please sing or write the next chapter with joy in your heart and
hope in your hands.
Go, be, wander, think, act, fail, love, cry, live, die and remember
as you move through this world, don’t fight yourself, don’t fight
each other, don’t fight nature. You are enough. Flow and move
with the forces of life. The energy is here. Don’t extract it, channel
it. We are custodial, we shepherd, we conduct. Richness is in
relations. We have one long history, a birth from a star, and a
natural world beyond anything we as a species can fathom in
language. Our oldest Indigenous systems give us the largest
intelligence to activate the patterns for how to live with and from
and in nature. Nature is our anchor. We are one species. We are
many species. Nature is our shared home. It’s where we come from
and where we end up, in the earth. As we look ahead to the next
seven billion years of Earth existing, before the sun munches it up,
can we imagine human life still here? Can we find a way to imagine
a billion years from now how this time sparked the songlines for
the next billion years, in relation to the intelligence of everything
that has been, embracing emergence, to release our control, and
find our place in this ongoing energy dance? As you look ahead,
may I wish upon you the most joyous of lives, emancipated from
individual control and command, freed through imagination, and
flowing with a vibe. May your light reflect, from the fire back to you,
on to all of us, deeply in relation, feeling that Jalngay energy. May
peace be the journey, and joy, the legacy of humankind.
When there is light in the soul,
There is beauty in the person.
When there is beauty in the person,
There is harmony in the home.
When there is harmony in the home,
There is honour in the nation.
When there is honour in the nation,
There is peace in the world.
When there is freedom in the IMAGI-NATION ...
And with that, I pass the notes on to you and step off the stage,
and I thank you for singing, dancing, flowing, rolling, bouncing and
weaving with me.
