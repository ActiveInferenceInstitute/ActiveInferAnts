it turns out that if you train a

planarian and then cut their heads off

the tail will regenerate a brand new

brain that still remembers the original

information I think planaria hold the

answer to pretty much every deep

question of life for one thing they're

similar to our ancestors so they have

true symmetry they have a true brain

they're not like earthworms they're you

know they're much more advanced life

form they have lots of different

internal organs but they're these little

um they're about you know maybe two

centimeters in in the centimeter to two

in size

I have a head in the tail and the first

thing is plenary are Immortal so they do

not age there's no such thing as an old

planarian so that right there tells you

that these theories of thermodynamic

limitations of on lifespan are wrong

it's not it's not that well over time of

everything degrades no planaria can keep

it going for uh probably you know how

long have they've been around 400

million years right so these are the

actual so the planaria in our lab are

actually in physical continuity with

planaria that we're here 400 million

years ago

the following is a conversation with

Michael Levin one of the most

fascinating and Brilliant biologists

I've ever talked to he and his lab at

Tufts University works on novel ways to

understand and control complex pattern

formation in biological systems Andre

carpathi a world-class AI researcher is

the person who first introduced me to

Michael Levin's work

I bring this up because these two people

make me realize that biology has a lot

to teach us about Ai and AI might have a

lot to teach us about biology

this is Alex Friedman podcast to support

it please check out our sponsors in the

description and now dear friends here's

Michael Levin

Embryogenesis
embryogenesis is the process of building

the human body from a single cell I

think it's one of the most incredible

things that exists on Earth from a

single embryo so how does this process

work yeah it is it is an incredible

process uh I think it's maybe the most

magical process there is and I think one

of the most fundamentally interesting

things about it is that it shows that

each of us takes the journey from

so-called just physics to mind right

because we all Start Life as a single

quiescent unfertilized oocyte and it's

basically a bag of chemicals and you

look at that and you say okay this is

chemistry and physics and then nine

months and some years later you have an

organism with high level cognition and

preferences and an inner life and so on

and what embryogenesis tells us is that

that transformation from physics to mind

is gradual it's smooth there is no

special place where you know a lightning

bolt says boom now you've gone from from

physics to True cognition that doesn't

happen and so we can see in this process

that the whole mystery you know the

biggest mystery of the you of the

universe basically how you get mind from

matter from just physics in quotes yeah

so where's the magic into the thing how

do we get from information encoded in

DNA

and make physical reality out of that

information so one of the things that I

think is really important if we're going

to bring in DNA into this picture is to

think about the fact that what DNA

encodes is the hardware of Life DNA

contains the instructions for the kind

of micro level Hardware that every cell

gets to play with so all the proteins

all the signaling factors the ion

channels all the cool little pieces of

Hardware that cells have that's what's

in the DNA the rest of it is in

so-called generic laws and these are

laws of mathematics these are laws of

computation these are laws of um of

physics of all all kinds of interesting

things that are not directly in the DNA

and that that process you know I think I

think the reason the reason I always put

just physics in quotes is because I

don't think there is such a thing as

just physics I think that thinking about

these things in binary categories like

this is physics this is true cognition

this is as if it's only faking other

these kinds of things I think that's

what gets us in trouble I think that we

really have to understand that it's a

Continuum and we have to work up the

scaling the laws of scaling and we can

and we can certainly talk about that

there's a lot of really interesting

thoughts to be had there so the physics

is deeply integrated with the

information so the DNA doesn't exist on

its own the DNA is a integrated as in

some sense in response to the the laws

of physics at every scale the laws

of the environment it exists in yeah the

environment and also the laws of the

Universe I mean the thing about the

thing about the the DNA is that it's um

once Evolution discovers a certain kind

of machine that if if the physical

implementation is appropriate it's sort

of uh and this is hard to talk about

because we don't have a good vocabulary

for this yet but it's a very kind of a

platonic notion that if the machine is

there it pulls down interesting uh

interesting things that you do not have

to evolve from scratch because the laws

of physics give it to you for free so

just as a really stupid example if

you're trying to evolve a particular

triangle you can evolve the first angle

and you evolve the second angle but you

don't need to evolve the third you know

what it is already now why do you know

that's that's a gift for free from

geometry in a particular space you know

what that angle has to be and if you

evolve an ion Channel which is Ion

channels are basically transistors right

they're voltage-gated current

conductances if you evolve that ION

channel you immediately get to use

things like truth tables you get logic

functions you don't have to evolve the

logic function you don't have to evolve

a truth table doesn't have to be in the

DNA it's you get it for free right and

the fact that if you have nand Gates you

can build anything you want you get that

for free all you have to evolve is that

that first step a first little machine

that that enables you to couple to those

laws and there's laws of adhesion and

and many other things and this is all um

that interplay between the the hardware

that's set up by the genetics and the

software that's paid right the

physiological software that basically

does all the computation and the

cognition and everything else is a real

interplay between the information and

the DNA and the laws of physics of

computation and so on so is it fair to

say just like this idea that the laws of

mathematics are discovered

they're Laden within the fabric of the

universe in that same way the laws of

biology are kind of discovered yeah I

think that's absolutely and it's

probably not a popular view but I think

that's right on the money yeah well I

think that's a really deep idea

then embryogenesis is the process of

revealing

of um

embodying of manifesting these laws

you're not building the laws you're just

creating the capacity to reveal yes I

think again not the standard view of

molecular biology by any means but I

think that's right on the money I'll

give you a simple example you know some

of our latest work with these xenobots

right so what we've done is to take some

skin cells off of an early frog embryo

and basically ask about their plasticity

if we give you a chance to sort of

reboot your multicellularity in a

different context what would you do

because what you might assume by the

thing about embryogenesis is that it's

super reliable right it's very robust

and that really obscures some of its

most interesting features we get used to

it we get used to the fact that acorns

make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs

and we say well what else is it going to

make that's what it you know that's what

it makes that's a standard story but the

reality is and so and so you look at

these um these skin cells you say well

what do they know how to do well they

know how to be a passive boring

two-dimensional outer layer keeping the

bacteria from getting into the embryo

that's what they know how to do well it

turns out that if you take these skin

cells and you remove the rest of the

embryo so you remove all of the rest of

the cells and you say well you're by

yourself now what do you want to do so

what they do is they form this little um

this multi-little creature that runs

around the dish they have all kinds of

incredible capacities they navigate

through mazes they have various

behaviors that they do both

independently and and together they uh

they have a uh but they basically they

Implement Von Neumann's dream of

self-replication because if you sprinkle

a bunch of loose cells into the dish

what they do is they run around they

collect those cells into little piles

they they sort of mush them together

until those little piles become the next

generation of xenobots so you've got

this machine that builds copies of

itself from loose material in its

environment none of this are

things that you would have expected from

the Frog genome in fact there's wild

type the genome was wild type there's

nothing wrong with their genetics

nothing has been added no Nano materials

no genomic editing nothing and so what

we have done there is engineer by

subtraction which you've done is you've

removed the other cells that normally

basically bully these cells into being

skin cells and you find out that what

they really want to do is is to be this

they want their default behaviors to be

a xenobot but in Vivo in the embryo they

get told to be skinned by these other

cell types and so so now so now here

comes this this really interesting

question that you just posed

when you ask where does the form of the

tadpole and the Frog come from the

standard answer as well it's it's it's a

selection so over over millions of years

right it's been shaped to to produce the

specific body with that's fit for froggy

environments where does the shape of the

xenobot come from there's never been any

zenobots there's never been selection to

be a good xenobot these cells find

themselves in the new environment in 48

hours they figure out how to be an

entirely different uh proto-organism

with new capacities like kinematic

self-replication that's not how frogs or

tadpoles replicate we've made it

impossible for them to replicate their

normal way within a couple days these

guys find a new way of doing it that's

not done anywhere else in the biosphere

well actually let's step back and Define

Xenobots: biological robots
what are xenobots

so a xenobod is uh self-assembling

little proto-organism it's also a

biological robot those things are not um

distinct it's a member of both classes

how much is a biology how much is it

robot

at this point most of it is biology

because what we're doing is we're

discovering natural uh behaviors of

these uh of these of the cells and also

of the cell collectives now one of the

really important parts of this was that

we're working together with Josh

bongard's group at University of Vermont

their computer scientists do Ai and

they've basically been able to use an

evolutionary a simulated Evolution

approach to ask how can we manipulate

these cells give them signals not rewire

their DNA so not Hardware but experience

as signals so can we remove some cells

can we add some cells can we poke them

in different ways to get them to do

other things so in the future there's

going to be you know we're now and this

is this is future on published work but

we're doing all sorts of interesting

ways to reprogram them to new behaviors

but before you can start to reprogram

these things you have to understand what

their innate capacities are okay so that

means

engineering programming you're

engineering them in in the future and in

some sense the the definition of a robot

is something you impart engineer yeah

and first versus evolve I mean um

it's such a fuzzy definition anyway in

some sense many of the organisms within

our body are kinds of robots yes yes and

I think robots is a weird line because

it's we tend to see robots as the other

I think there will be a time in the

future when there's going to be

something akin to the Civil Rights

movements for robots but we'll talk

about that later perhaps sure anyway

um

so how do you can we just Linger on it

how do you build a zenobot what are we

talking about here

from from whence does it start and how

does it become

the Glorious zenobot yeah so just to

take one step back one of the things

that a lot of people uh get stuck on is

they say well uh you know engineering

requires new DNA circuits or it requires

new nanomaterials you know what the

thing is we are now moving from Old

School engineering which use passive

materials right that things like you

know wood metal things like this that

basically the only thing you could

depend on is that they were going to

keep their shape that's it they don't do

anything else you it's on you as an

engineer to make them do everything

they're going to do and then there were

active materials and now computationals

this is a whole new era these are

agential materials this is your you're

now collaborating with your substrate

because your material has an agenda

these cells have you know billions of

years of evolution they have goals they

have preferences they're not just going

to sit where you put them that's

hilarious that you have to talk your

material and to keep your kitchen that's

it that is exactly right that is exactly

right stay there it's like getting a

bunch of cats or something and trying to

organize the shape out of them it's

funny we're on the same page here

because in a paper this is this is

currently um just been accepted in

nature by engineering one of the figures

I have is building a tower out of Legos

versus dogs right yeah so think about

the difference right if you build out of

Legos you have full control over where

it's going to go but if somebody knocks

it over it's game over with the dogs you

cannot just come and stack them they're

not going to stay that way but the good

news is that if you train them then

somebody knocks it over they'll get

right back up so it's all right so as an

engineer what you really want to know is

what can they depend on this thing to do

right that's really you know a lot of

people have definitions of robots as far

as what they're made of or how they got

here you know design versus evolve

whatever I don't think any of that is

useful I think I think as an engineer

what you want to know is how much can I

depend on this thing to do when I'm not

around to micromanage it what level of

uh what level of dependency can I can I

give this thing how much agency does it

have which then tells you what

techniques do you use so do you use

micromanagement like you put everything

where it goes do you train it do you

give it signals do you try to convince

it to do things right how much you know

how intelligent is your substrate and so

now we're moving into this into this

area where you're you're working with

agential materials that's a

collaboration that's not that's not old

old style what's the word you're using a

gentle a gentle what's that mean agency

if it comes from the word agency so so

basically the material has agency

meaning that it has some some level of

obviously not human level but some level

of uh preferences goals memories ability

to remember things to compute into the

future meaning anticipate uh you know

when you're working with cells they have

all of that to some to various degrees

is that empowering or limiting having

material as a mind of its own literally

I think it's both right so it raises

difficulties because it means that it if

you if you're using the old mindset

which is a linear

um kind of extrapolation of what's going

to happen you're going to be surprised

and shocked all the time because biology

uh does not do what we linearly expect

materials to do on the other hand it's

massively liberating and so in the

following way I've argued that advances

in regenerative medicine require us to

take advantage of this because what it

means is that you can get the material

to do things that you don't know how to

micromanage so just as a simple example

right if you if you you had a rat and uh

you wanted this rat to do a circus trick

put a ball in the little hoop you can do

it the micromanagement way which is try

to control every neuron and try to play

the thing like a puppet right and maybe

someday that'll be possible maybe or you

can train the rat and this is why

Humanity for thousands of years before

we knew any Neuroscience we had no idea

what's behind what's between the ears of

any animal we were able to train these

animals because once you recognize the

level of agency of a certain system you

can use appropriate techniques if you

know the currency of motivation reward

and Punishment you know how smart it is

you know what kinds of things it likes

to do you are searching a much more much

smoother much nicer problem space than

if you try to micromanage the thing and

then regenerative medicine when you're

trying to get let's say an arm to grow

back or an eye to repair so birth defect

or something do you really want to be

controlling tens of thousands of genes

at each point to try to micromanage it

or do you want to find the high level

modular control roles let's say build an

arm here you already know how to build

an arm you did it before do it again so

that's I I think it's it's both it's

both the difficult and it challenges us

to develop new ways of engineering and

it's it's hugely empowering okay so how

do you do I mean maybe sticking with the

metaphor of dogs and cats

I presume you have to figure out the

find the dogs and uh dispose of the cats

um because you know it's like the old

herding cats is an issue so you may be

able to train dogs

I suspect you will not be able to train

cats

or if you do you're never going to be

able to trust them so is there a way to

figure out which material is amenable

to hurting is it in the lab work or is

it in simulation right now it's largely

in the lab because we are our

simulations do not capture yet the most

uh interesting and Powerful things about

biology so the simulation what what

we're pretty good at simulating are feed

forward emergent types of things right

so cellular automata if you have simple

rules and you sort of roll those forward

for every every agent or every cell in

the simulation then complex things

happen you know ant colony or algorithms

things like that we're we're good at

that and that's and that's fine the

difficulty with all of that is that it's

incredibly hard to reverse so this is a

really hard inverse problem right if you

look at a bunch of termites and they

make a you know a thing with a single

chimney and you say well I like it but

I'd like two chimneys how do you change

the rules of behavior for each termite

so they make two chimneys right or or if

you say hear a bunch of cells that are

creating this kind of organism I I don't

think that's optimal I'd like to to

repair that birth defect how do you

control all the all the individual

low-level rules right all the protein

interactions and everything else rolling

it back from the anatomy that you want

to the low-level Hardware rules is in

general intractable it's a it's an

inverse problem that's generally not

soluble so

um right now it's mostly in the lab

because what we need to do is we need to

understand how biology uses top-down

controls so the idea is not not

bottom-up emergence but the idea of

things like gold directed uh test

operate exit kinds of Loops where where

it's basically an error minimization

function over a new space it's not a

space of gene expression but for example

a space of anatomy so just as a simple

example if you have you have a

salamander it's got an arm you can you

can amputate that arm anywhere along the

length it will grow exactly what's

needed and then it stops that's the most

amazing thing about regeneration is that

it stops it knows when to stop when does

it stop it stops when a correct

salamander arm has been completed so

that tells you that's the right that's a

that's a uh a mean Zen's kind of

analysis where it has to know what the

correct limb is supposed to look like

right so it has a way to ascertain the

current shape it has a way to measure

that Delta from from what shape it's

supposed to be and then we'll keep

taking actions meaning Remodeling and

growing and everything else until that's

complete so once you know that and we've

taken advantage of this in the lab to do

some some really wild things with with

both planaria and frog embryos and so on

once you know that

um you can start playing with that uh

with that homeostatic cycle you can ask

for example well how does it remember

what the correct shape is and can we

mess with that memory can we give it a

false memory of what the shape should be

and let the cells build something else

or can we mess with the measurement

apparatus right so it gives you it gives

you those kinds of so so the idea is to

basically appropriate a lot of the um

approaches and Concepts from cognitive

neuroscience and Behavioral Science into

things that uh previously were taken to

be dumb materials and you know you get

yelled at in class if you if you for

being anthropomorphic if you said well

my cells want to do this and my cells

want to do that and I think I think

that's a that's a major mistake that

leaves a ton of capabilities on the

table so thinking about biologic systems

is things that have memory have almost

something like cognitive ability

but

I mean

how incredible is it you know that the

salamander arm is being

rebuilt not with a dictator

it's kind of like the cellular automata

system all the individual workers are

doing their own thing

so where's that oh wait top down signal

that doesn't control coming from like

how can you find it yeah like why does

it stop growing how does it know the

shape how does it have memory of the

shape and how does it tell everybody to

be like whoa whoa slow down we're done

so the first thing to to think about I

think is that there are no examples

anywhere of of a central dictator

because in in this in this kind of

science because everything is made of

parts and so we we even though we we

feel as a unified Central sort of

intelligence and kind of point of of

cognition we are a bag of neurons right

we all intelligence is collective

intelligence there's this this is

important to kind of um and think about

because a lot of people think okay

there's real intelligence like me and

then there's collective intelligence

which is the ants and flocks of birds

and you know termites and things like

that and and you know and and maybe it's

appropriate to think of them as a as a

as an individual and maybe it's not a

lot of people are skeptical about about

that and so on but you've got to realize

that we are not there's no such thing as

this like indivisible Diamond of

intelligence that's like this one

Central thing that's not made of parts

we are all made of parts and so if if

you believe that which I think is is

hard to uh to get around that that we in

fact have a centralized um set of goals

and preferences and we plan and we do

things and so on you are already

committed to the fact that a collection

of cells is able to do this because we

are a collection of cells there's no

getting around that in our case what we

do is we navigate the three-dimensional

world and we have Behavior this is

blowing my mind right now because we are

just a collection of stuff oh yeah yeah

so when I'm moving this arm

I feel like I'm the central dictator of

that action but there's a lot of stuff

going on like every all all the cells

here collaborating in some interesting

way they're getting signal from the

central nervous system well even the

central nervous system is is

misleadingly named because it isn't

really Central again it's it's what it's

just a bunch of cells I mean all of the

right there are no you there are no

singular indivisible intelligences

anywhere we are all every every example

that we've ever seen is is a collective

of some of something it's just that

we're used to it we're used to that you

know we're used to okay this thing is

kind of a single thing but it's really

not you zoom in you know what you see

you see a bunch of cells running around

and so is there some unifying I mean

we're just jumping around but that

something that you look as the the

biological signal versus the biochemical

the

um the chemistry the electricity

maybe the life isn't that

versus the cells

it's the uh there's there's an orchestra

playing and uh the resulting music is

the dictator that's not bad um Dennis

that's Dennis Nobles uh kind of view of

things he has two really good books

where he talks about this musical

analogy right so so I think that's

that's I like it um I like it is it

wrong though I don't think it's no I

don't think it's wrong

um I don't I don't think it's wrong I

think I think the important thing about

it is that we have to come to grips with

the fact that a true a a true proper uh

cognitive intelligence can still be made

of Parts those things are and in fact it

has to be and I I think it's a real

shame but I see this all the time when

you have uh when you have a collective

like this whether it be uh a group of

robots or a you know a collection of

cells or neurons or whatever as soon as

as soon as we gain some insight into how

it works right meaning that oh I see in

order to take this action here's the

information that got processed via this

camera mechanism or whatever immediately

people say oh well then that's not real

cognition that's just physics I think

this is this is fundamentally flawed

Sense of self
because if you zoom into anything what

are you going to see of course you're

just going to see physics what else

could be underneath right that's not

going to be fairy dust it's going to be

physics and chemistry but that doesn't

take away from the magic of the fact

that there are certain ways to arrange

that physics and chemistry and in

particular the bioelectricity which I

like a lot uh to give you an emergent uh

Collective with goals and preferences

and memories and anticipations that do

not belong to any of the subunits so I

think what we're getting into here and

we can talk about how how this happens

during embryogenesis and so on what

we're getting into is the origin of the

of a self yeah with a big with a capital

S so we ourselves there are many other

kinds of selves and we can tell some

really interesting stories about where

selves come from and how they become

unified yeah is this the first

or at least humans tend to think that

this is the the level at which the self

with the capital s is first born

but uh and we really don't want to see

um human civilization or Earth itself as

one living organism yeah that's very

uncomfortable to us it is yeah but is um

yeah where's the self born we have to

grow up past that so what I like to do

is uh I'll tell you two quick stories

about that I like to roll backwards so

so as opposed to so if you start and you

say okay here's a paramecium and you see

it um you know it's a single cell

organism you see it doing various things

and people will say okay I'm sure

there's some chemical story to be told

about how it's doing it so that's not

true cognition right and people will

argue about that I I like to work it

backwards I said let's let's agree that

you and I as as we sit here are examples

of true cognition if anything is if

there's anything that's true cognition

we are we are examples of it now let's

just roll back slowly right so you roll

back to the time when you're a small

child and used to doing whatever and

then just sort of day by day you roll

you roll back and eventually you become

more or less that paramecium and then

and then you sort of even below that

right as an unfertilized Osa so it's no

one has to my knowledge no one has come

up with any convincing discreet Step At

which my cognitive Powers disappear

right it just doesn't the biology

doesn't offer any specific step it's com

it's incredibly smooth and slow and

continuous and so I think this idea that

it just sort of magically shows up uh at

one point and then and then uh you know

humans have true selves that don't exist

elsewhere I think it runs against

everything we know about Evolution

everything we know about developmental

biology these are all slow continua and

the other really important story I want

to tell is where embryos come from so

think about this for a second amniot

embryo so this is humans birds and so on

mammals and birds and so on imagine a

flat disc of cells so there's maybe 50

000 cells and in that so when you get an

egg from a from a fertilizer let's say

you buy a fertilized egg from a farm

right that that egg uh will will have

about 50 000 cells in um in a flat disc

it looks like a little little tiny

little Frisbee and in that flat disc

what will happen is there'll be uh one

one set of cells will uh becomes will

become special and it will tell all the

other cells I'm I'm going to be the head

you guys don't be the head and so it'll

amplify symmetry breaking amplification

you get one embryo there's a there's a

you know there's some neural tissue and

some other stuff forms now now you say

okay I had one egg and one embryo and

then there you go what else could it be

well the reality is and I used to I I

did all of this as a grad student if you

um if you take a little needle and you

make a scratch in that blasted room in

that in that disc such that the cells

can't talk to each other for a while it

heals up but for a while they can't talk

to each other what will happen is that

uh both regions will decide that they

can be the embryo and there will be two

of them and then when they heal up they

become conjoint Twins and you can make

two you can make three you can make lots

so the question of how many selves are

in there cannot be answered until it's

actually played all the way through it

isn't necessarily that there's just one

there can be many so what you have is

you have this medium this this

undifferentiated I'm sure there's a

there's a psychological

um version of this somewhere that I

don't know the proper terminology but

you have this you have this list like

put ocean of potentiality you have these

thousands of cells and some number of

individuals are going to be formed out

of it usually one sometimes zero

sometimes several and they they form out

of these cells because a region of these

cells organizes into a collective that

will have goals goals that individual

cells don't have for example make a limb

make an eye how many eyes well exactly

two so individual cells don't know what

an eye is they don't know how many eyes

you're supposed to have but the

collective does the collective has goals

and memories and anticipations that the

individual cells don't and that that the

establishment of that boundary with its

own ability to maintain to to pursue

certain goals that's the origin of of

selfhood

but I is that goal

in there somewhere but they always

destined like are they discovering that

goal like where the hell did Evolution

um discover this when you went from the

prokaryotes to you you carry out excels

and then they started making groups and

when you make a certain group you make a

you you make it sound

that's such a tricky thing to try to

understand you make it sound like this

cells didn't get together and came up

with a goal but the very Act of them

getting together

revealed the goal that was always there

there was always that potential for that

goal so the first thing to say is that

there are way more questions here than

than certainties okay so everything I'm

telling you is is Cutting Edge

developing you know stuff so so it's not

as if any of us know the answer to this

but but here's here's here's my opinion

on this I think what evolution I I don't

think that Evolution produces solutions

to specific problems in other words

specific environments like here's a frog

that can live well in a froggy

environment I think what evolution

produces is problem-solving machines and

that that will that will solve problems

in different spaces so not just

three-dimensional space this goes back

to what we were talking about before we

the the brain is a evolutionarily a late

development it's a system that is able

to to pursue goals in three-dimensional

Space by giving commands to muscles

where did that system come from that

system evolved from a much more ancient

evolutionarily much more ancient system

where collections of cells gave

instructions to for cell behaviors

meaning cells move to to divide to to

die to change into different cell types

to navigate morphe space the space of

anatomies the space of all possible

anatomies and before that cells were

navigating transcriptional space which

is a space of all possible Gene

expressions and before that metabolic

space so what evolution has done I think

is is is produced Hardware that is very

good at navigating different spaces

using a bag of tricks right which which

I'm sure many of them we can steal for

autonomous vehicles and Robotics and

various things and what happens is that

they navigate these spaces without a

whole lot of commitment to what the

space is in fact they don't know what

the space is right we are all brains in

a vat so to speak every cell does not

know right every cell is some other some

other cells external environment right

so where does the with that border

between you you and the outside world

you don't really know where that is

right every every collection of cell has

to figure that out from scratch

and the fact that Evolution requires all

of these things to figure out what they

are what effectors they have what

sensors they have where does it make

sense to draw a boundary between me and

the outside world the fact that you have

to build all that from scratch this

autopoiesis is what defines uh the

border of a self now biology uses like a

um a multi a multi-scale competency

architecture meaning that every level

has goals so so molecular networks have

goals cells have goals tissues organs

colonies uh and and it's the interplay

of all of those that uh that enable

biology to solve problems in new ways

for example and xenobots and various

other things

um this is

you know uh it's it's exactly as you

said in many ways the cells are

discovering new ways of being but at the

same time Evolution certainly shapes all

this so so evolution is very good at

this agential bioengineering right when

evolution is uh discovering a new way of

being an animal yet one animal or a

plant or something sometimes it's by

changing the hardware you know protein

changing proteins protein structure and

so on but much of the time it's not by

changing the hardware it's by changing

the signals that the cells give to each

other it's doing what we as Engineers do

which is try to convince the cells to do

various things by using signals

experiences stimuli that's what biology

does it has to because it's not dealing

with a blank slate every time as you

know if you're a Evolution and you're

trying to uh uh make make a make an

organism you're not dealing with a

passive material that is is fresh and

you have to specify it already wants to

do certain things so the easiest way to

do that search to find whatever is going

to be adaptive is to find the signals

that are going to um convince cells to

do various things right

your sense is that Evolution operates

both in the software and the hardware

and it's just easier more efficient to

operate in the software yes and I should

also say I I don't think the distinction

is sharp in other words I think it's a

Continuum but I think we can but I think

it's a meaningful distinction where you

can make changes to a particular protein

and now the enzymatic function is

different and it metabolizes differently

and whatever and that will have

implications for Fitness or you can

change the huge

um amount of information in the genome

that isn't structural at all it's it's

uh it's signaling it's when and how do

cells say certain things to each other

and that can have massive changes as far

as how it's going to solve problems I

Multi-scale competency architecture
mean this idea of multi-hierarchical

competence architecture which is

incredible to think about so this

hierarchy that Evolution builds I don't

know who's responsible for this

I also see the incompetence of

bureaucracies of humans when they get

together

so how the hell does evolution build

this where

at every level only the best get to

stick around they somehow figure out how

to do their job without knowing the

bigger picture

and then there's like the bosses that do

the bigger thing

somehow or that you can now abstract

away the small group of cells as a as an

organ or something and then that organ

does something bigger

in the context of the full body or

something like this

how is that built is there some

intuition you can kind of provide of how

that's constructed that that

hierarchical confidence architecture

I love that confidence just the word

confidence is pretty cool in this

context because everybody's good at

their job somehow yeah no it's really

key and the other nice thing about

competency is that so so my my central

belief in all of this is that

engineering is the right perspective on

all of this stuff because it gets you

away from uh subjective uh terms you

know people talk about sentience and

this and that those things very hard to

define or people argue about them

philosophically I think that engineering

terms like competency like um you know

pursuit of goals right all of these

things are uh are empirically incredibly

useful because you know it when you see

it and if it helps you build right if I

if I can pick the right level I say uh

this thing has I believe this is X level

of like con if you competency I think

it's like a thermostat or I think it's

like a a better thermostat or I think

it's a you know a a various other kinds

of you know many many different kinds of

complex systems if that helps me to

control and and predict and build such

system then that's all there is to say

there's no more philosophy to argue

about so so I like competency in that

way because you can quantify you could

you have to in fact you have to you have

to make a claim competent at what and

then or if I say if I tell you it has a

goal the question is what's the goal and

how do you know and I say well because

every time I deviated from this

particular State that's what it spends

energy to get back to that's the goal

and we can quantify and we can be

objective about it so so so the the when

we're not used to thinking about this I

I give a talk sometimes called why don't

robots get cancer right and the reason

robots don't get cancer is because

generally speaking with a few exceptions

are our architectures have been you've

got a bunch of dumb parts and you hope

that if you put them together the the

the the overlying machine will have some

intelligence and do something rather

right but the individual Parts don't

don't care they don't have an agenda

biology isn't like that every level has

an agenda and the final outcome is the

result of cooperation and competition

both within and across levels so for

example during embryogenesis your

tissues and organs are competing with

each other and it's actually a really

important part of development there's a

reason they compete with each other

they're not all just uh you know sort of

helping each other they're also

competing for for information for

metabolic for limited metabolic

constraints

but to get back to your your other point

which is you know which is which is this

seems like really efficient and and good

and and so on compared to some of our

human efforts we also have to keep in

mind that what happens here is that each

level

bends the option space for the level

beneath so that your parts basically

they don't see the the geometry so so

I'm using um and I think I I take this

this seriously uh terminology from from

like um from like relativity right where

the space is literally bent so the

option space is deformed by the higher

level so that the lower levels all they

really have to do is go down their

concentration gradient they don't have

to in fact they don't they can't know

what the big picture is but if you bend

the space just right if they do what

locally seems right they end up doing

your bidding they end up doing things

that are optimal in the in the higher

space conversely because the components

are good at getting their job done you

as the higher level don't need to to try

to compute all the low level controls

all you're doing is bending the space

you don't know or care how they're going

to do it give you a super simple example

in the um in the tadpole we found that

okay so so tadpoles need to become frogs

and to become to go from a tadpole head

to a frog head you have to rearrange the

face so the eyes have to move forward

the Jaws have to to come out the

nostrils move like everything moves it

used to be thought that because all

tadpoles look the same and all frogs

look the same if you just remember if

every piece just moves in the right

direction the right amount then you get

your you get your frog right so we

decided to test we I had this hypothesis

that I thought I thought actually the

system is probably more intelligent than

that so what did we do we made what we

call Picasso tadpoles so these are so

everything is scramble so the eyes are

on the back of the head their jaws are

off to the side everything is scrambled

well guess what they make they make

pretty normal frogs because all the

different things move around in novel

paths configurations until they get to

the correct froggy sort of frog face

configuration then they stop so so the

thing about that is now imagine

Evolution right so so you make some sort

of mutation and it does like every

mutation it does many things so so

something good comes of it but also it

moves your mouth off to the side right

now if if if there wasn't this

multi-scale companies you can see where

this is going if there wasn't this

multi-scale competency the organism

would be dead your Fitness is zero

because you can't eat and you would

never get to explore the other

beneficial consequences of that mutation

you'd have to wait until you find some

other way of doing it without moving

them out that's really hard so so the

fitness landscape would be incredibly

rugged Evolution would take forever the

reason it works one of the reasons it

works so well is because you do that no

worries the mouth will find its way

where where it belongs right so now you

get to explore so so what that means is

that all these mutations that otherwise

would be deleterious are now neutral

because the competency of the parts

make up for all kinds of things so all

the noise of development all the the

variability in the environment all these

things the companies do the parts makes

up for it so the so so that's all that's

all fantastic right that's all that's

all great the only other thing to

remember when we compare this to human

efforts is this every component has its

own goals in various spaces usually with

very little regard for the welfare of

the other levels so so as a simple

example you know

um you as a as a complex system

um you will go out and you will do you

know Jiu Jitsu or whatever you'll have

some to go rock climbing scrape a bunch

of cells off your hands and then you're

happy as a system right you come back

and you've you've accomplished some

goals and you're really happy those

cells are dead they're gone right did

you think about those cells not really

right you had some you had some bruising

out selfish SLB that's it and so and so

that's the thing to remember is that

um you know and we know this from from

history is that is that just being a

collective isn't enough because uh what

the goals of that Collective will be

relative to the welfare of the

individual Parts is a massively open

place justify the means I'm telling you

Stalin was on to something no that's the

danger but we can exactly that's the

danger of uh

for us humans we have to construct

ethical systems

under which we don't take seriously the

full mechanism of biology and apply it

to the way the world functions which is

which is an interesting line we've drawn

the world that built us

is the one we reject in some sense when

we construct human societies the idea

that this country was founded on that

all men are created equal that's such a

fascinating idea it's like uh you're

fighting against

nature

and you're saying well there's something

bigger here than um yeah a hierarchical

competency architecture yeah uh but

there's so many interesting things you

said so from an algorithmic perspective

the act of bending the option space

that's really that's really profound

because if you look at the way AI

systems are built today there's a big

system like I said with robots and as a

goal and he gets better and better at

optimizing that goal at accomplishing

that goal but if biology built a

hierarchical system where everything is

doing computation

and everything is accomplishing the goal

not only that

it's kind of dumb

you know with the uh with the limited

with the bent option space it's just

doing the thing that's the easiest thing

for it in some sense and somehow that

allows you to have

um Turtles on top of turtles literally

dump systems on top of dump systems that

as a whole create something incredibly

smart yeah I mean every system is has

some degree of intelligence in its own

problem domain so so cells will have

problems they're trying to solve in

physiological space and transcriptional

space and then I could give you some

some cool examples of that but the

collective is trying to solve problems

in anatomical space right and forming a

you know a creature and growing your

blood vessels and so on and then the

collect the the the the whole body is

solving yet other problems they may be

in Social space and linguistic space in

three-dimensional space and and who

knows you know the group might be

solving problems and and um you know I

don't know some sort of financial space

or something so one of the major

differences with with most

um uh with most AIS today is is a the

the kind of flatness of the architecture

but also of the fact that they're

constructed

from outside their their borders and

their you know so so if you're so to a

large extent and of course there are

counter examples now but but to a large

extent our technology has been such that

you create a machine or a robot it knows

what its sensors are it knows what its

effectors are it knows the boundary

between it and the outside world all

this is given from the outside

biology constructs this from scratch now

the best example of this that that

originally uh in in robotics was

actually Josh bongard's work in 2006

where he made these these robots that

did not know their shape to start with

so like a baby these are floundered

around they made some hypotheses well I

did this and I moved in this way well

maybe I'm a whatever maybe I have wheels

or maybe I have six legs or whatever

right and they would make a model and

eventually they would crawl around so

that's I mean that's really good that's

part of the autopoiesis but we can go a

step further and some people are doing

this and then we're sort of working on

some of this too is this idea that let's

even go back further you don't even know

what sensors you have you don't know

where you end and the outside world

begins all you have is is certain things

like active inference meaning you're

trying to minimize surprise right you

have some metabolic constraints you

don't have all the energy you need you

don't have all the time in the world to

to think about everything you want to

think about so that means that you can't

afford to be a micro

um reductionist you know all this data

coming in you have to coarse grain it

and say I'm going to take all this stuff

and I'm going to call that a cat I'm

gonna take all this I'm going to call

that the edge of the table I don't want

to follow off of and I don't want to

know anything about the microstates what

I want to know is what is the optimal

way to cut up my world and by the way

this thing over here that's me and the

reason that's me is because I have more

control over this than I have over any

of this other stuff and so now you can

begin to write so that's

self-construction that that figuring out

making models of the outside world and

then turning that inwards and starting

to make a model of yourself right which

immediately starts to get into issues of

agency and control because

in order to if if you are under

Free will
metabolic constraints meaning you don't

have the energy right that all the

energy in the world you have to be

efficient that immediately forces you to

start telling stories about course

grained agents that do things right you

don't have the energy to like laplaces

demon you know calculate every every

possible uh State that's going to happen

you have to you have to coarse grain and

you have to say that is the kind of

creature that does things either things

that I avoid or things that I will go

towards that's a mate or food or

whatever it's going to be and so right

at the base of uh simple very simple

organisms starting to make

models of Agents doing things that is

the origin of uh models of of Free Will

basically right because you see the

world around you as having agency and

then you turn that on yourself and you

say wait I have agency too I can I do

things right and and then you make

decisions about what you're going to do

so all of this one one model is to view

all of those kinds of things as

being driven by that early need to

determine what you are and to do so and

to then take actions in the most

energetically efficient space possible

right so free will emerges when you try

to simplify tell a nice narrative about

your environment I think that's very

possible yeah do you think free was an

illusion

so so you're kind of implying that it's

a useful hack

well I'll say two things the first thing

is I think I think it's very plausible

to say that any organism that's self or

any agent that's self whether it's

biological or not any agent that

self-constructs under energy constraints

is going to believe in free will but

we'll get to whether it has free will

momentarily but but I think but I think

what what it definitely drives is a view

of yourself and the outside world as an

agential view I think that's inescapable

so that's true for even primitive

organisms I think so I think that's now

now they don't have now obviously you

have to scale down right so so so so

they don't have for the kinds of complex

metacognition that we have so they can

do long-term planning and thinking about

Free Will and so and so on but but the

sense of agency is really useful to

accomplish a tasks simple or complicated

that's right in in all kinds of spaces

not just in in obvious three-dimensional

space I mean we're very good that the

thing is

humans are very good at detecting agency

of like medium-sized objects moving at

medium speeds in the three-dimensional

world right we see a bowling ball and we

see a mouse and we immediately know what

the difference is right and how we're

gonna mostly things you can eat or get

eaten by yeah yeah that's our that's our

training set right from the time you're

little your training set is visual data

on on this this like little chunk of

your experience but imagine if imagine

if uh from the time that we were born we

had innate senses of your blood

chemistry if you could feel your blood

chemistry the way you can see right you

had a high bandwidth connection and you

could feel your blood chemistry and you

could see you could sense all the things

that your organs were doing so your

pancreas your liver all the things if if

we had that you we would be very good at

detecting intelligence and physiological

space we would know the level of

intelligence that our various organs

were deploying to deal with things that

were coming to anticipate the stimuli to

you know but but we're just terrible at

that we don't in fact in fact people

don't even you know you talk about

intelligence to these other spaces and a

lot of people think that's just crazy

because because all all we're all we

know is motion we do have access to that

information so it's actually possible

that uh so Evolution could if we wanted

to construct an organism that's able to

perceive the flow of blood through your

body the way you see an old friend and

say yo what's up how's the wife and the

kids uh in that same way you would see

that you would feel like a connection to

the liver yeah yeah I think you know

maybe other people's liver no just your

own because you don't have access to

other people's lives not yet but you

could imagine some really interesting

connection right but like sexual

selection like oh that girl's got a nice

liver well that's like the the way her

blood flows the the Dynamics of the

blood

uh is very interesting it's novel I've

never seen one of those but you know

that's that's exactly what we're trying

to half-ass when we when we um uh judge

Judgment of beauty by facial Symmetry

and so on that's that's a half-assed

assessment of exactly that of exactly

that because if your cells could not

cooperate enough to keep your your

organism symmetrical yeah you know you

can make some inferences about what else

is wrong right like that's a that's a

very you know that's a very basic

interesting yeah so that in some deep

sense actually that is what we're doing

where

trying to infer

how

the health we use the word healthy but

basically how functional is this

biological system I'm looking at so I

can con hook up with that one and make

Offspring yeah yeah well what kind of

Hardware might their genomics give me

that that might be useful in the future

I wonder why Evolution didn't give us

um higher resolution signal like why the

whole peacock thing with the feathers it

doesn't seem

the very low bandwidth signal for sexual

selection I'm gonna and I'm not an

expert on on this stuff but on peacocks

well no you know but but I'll take a

stab at the reason I think that it's

because it's an arms race you see you

don't want everybody to know everything

about you so I think that as much as as

much as and in fact there's another

interesting part of this arms race which

is

if you think about this uh the the most

adaptive evolvable system is one that

has the most level of top-down control

right if it's really easy to say to a

bunch of cells make another finger

versus okay here's 10 000 gene

expression changes that you need to do

to make it to change your finger right

the the the the the the system with good

top-down control that has memory and we

need to get back to that by the way

that's a question I neglected to answer

about where the memory is and so on

um a system that uses all of that is

really highly evolvable and that's

fantastic but guess what it's also

highly um subject to hijacking by

parasites by uh by by by cheaters of

various kinds by con specifics like we

we found that um and then that that goes

back to the story of the pattern memory

these in these planaria there's a

bacterium that lives on these planaria

that bacterium has an input into how

many heads the worm is going to have

because it's hijacks that that control

system and it's able to make a chemical

that basically interfaces with the

system that calculates how many heads

you're supposed to have have and they

can have to and they can make them have

two heads and so you can imagine that if

you are two so you want to be

understandable for your own parts to

understand each other but you don't want

to be too understandable because you'll

be too easily controllable and so I

think that that my guess is that that

um that that that that opposing pressure

keeps this from being a super high

bandwidth kind of thing where we can

just look at somebody and know you know

everything about them so it's a kind of

biological game of Texas Hold'em yeah

he's showing some cards and you're

hiding other cards and that's part of it

and there's bluffing and there's and all

that and then just probably whole

species that would do way too much

bluffing that's probably where peacocks

fall I mean there's a there's a book

that I don't remember if I read or if I

if I wrote If I read summaries of the

book but it's about the evolution of

beauty and birds where is that from is

that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk

about it but basically there's some

species start to like over select for

beauty not overselect they just some

reason select for beauty there is a case

to be made actually now I'm starting to

remember I think Darwin himself made a

case that you can select based on beauty

alone

so yeah that beauty there's a point

would be it doesn't represent some

underlying biological truth you start to

select for for beauty itself and I think

the the Deep question is there is some

if is there some evolutionary value to

Beauty but that's an interesting kind of

thought that this

can we deviate completely from the deep

biological truth to actually appreciate

some kind of the the summarization

itself

let me get back to memory because that's

a really interesting idea

um

how do a collection of cells remember

anything how do biological systems

remember anything how is that akin to

the kind of memory we think of humans as

having within our big cognitive engine

yeah one of the ways to start thinking

about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves

where did neurons and all these cool

tricks that the brain uses to run these

amazing problem-solving abilities on and

basically an electrical Network right

where did that come from they didn't

just evolve you know up here out of

nowhere it must have evolved from

something and what it evolved from was a

much more ancient ability of cells to

form networks to solve other kinds of

problems for example to navigate morphos

space to control the body's shape and so

all of the components

of uh of neurons so so ion channels um

neurotransmitter Machinery electrical

synapses all this stuff is way older

than brains way older than neurons in

fact older than multicellularity and so

it was already even even bacterial

biofilms there's some beautiful work

from UCSD on on on brain-like Dynamics

and bacterial biofilms so Evolution

figured out very early on that

electrical networks are amazing at

having memories at integrating

information across distance at different

kinds of optimization tasks you know

image recognition and so on long before

there were brains can you actually step

back we'll return to it what is

Bioelectricity
bioelectricity what is biochemistry what

is what are electrical networks I think

a lot of the biology Community focuses

on

the chemicals as the signaling

mechanisms that make the whole thing

work you have

I think

to a large degree uniquely maybe you can

correct me on that have focused on the

bioelectricity which is using

electricity for signaling there's also

probably mechanical sure sure knocking

on the door

uh so what what what's the difference

and what's an electrical Network yeah so

I want to make sure and and kind of give

credit where creditors do so so as far

back as 1903 and probably

um late 1800s already people were

thinking about the importance of

electrical phenomena in in life so I'm

for sure not the first person to stress

the importance of electricity

um people there were there were waves of

research in the in the 30s in the 40s

and then again in the kind of uh 70s 80s

and 90s of of sort of the pioneers of

bioelectricity who did some amazing work

on all this I think I think what what

we've done that's new is to step away

from this idea that and I'll describe

what what the bioelectricity is is step

away from the idea that well here's

another piece of physics that you need

to keep track of to understand

physiology and development and to really

start looking at this as saying no this

is a a privileged computational layer

that gives you access to the actual

cognition of the tissue of basal

cognition so so merging that that

developmental biophysics with ideas and

cognition of computation and so on I

think I think that's what we've done

that's new but people have been talking

about bioelectricity for a really long

time and and so also I'll Define that so

um what happens is that uh if you have

uh if you have a single cell cell has a

membrane in that membrane are proteins

called ion channels and those proteins

allow charged molecules potassium sodium

chloride to go in and out under certain

circumstances and when there's an

imbalance of of those ions there becomes

a voltage gradient across that membrane

and so all cells all living cells try to

hold a particular kind of voltage uh

difference across the membrane and they

spend a lot of energy to do so when you

now now so so that's that's a single

cell when you have multiple cells that's

all sitting next to each other they can

communicate their voltage state to each

other via a number of different ways but

one of them is this thing called a gap

Junction which is basically like a

Little Submarine hash that's just kind

of docks right and the ions from one

side can flow to the other side and vice

versa

so isn't it incredible that this evolved

it's not it's not wild because that

didn't exist

correct this had to be this had to be

evolved and had to be invented that's

right somebody invented electricity in

the in the ocean one of this is a good

event yeah so so I mean it is it is

incredible um the guy who discovered Gap

Junctions Werner Lowenstein I visited

him he was really old human being he

discovered because who really discovered

them live probably four billion years

ago good point so your your give credit

where credit is due he he rediscovered

he rediscovered uh Gap Junctions but um

when I visited him in in Woods Hole uh

maybe 20 years ago now uh he told me

that he was writing and unfortunately he

he passed away and I think this this

book never got written he was writing a

book on on Gap Junctions and

Consciousness and I think I think it

would have been a an Incredible Book

because because Gap junctures are magic

I'll explain why in a minute uh what

happens is that just imagine the thing

about both these ion channels and these

Gap Junctions is that many of them are

themselves voltage sensitive

so that's a voltage sensitive current

conductance that's a transistor and as

soon as you've invented one immediately

you now get access to from from this

platonic space of of mathematical truths

you get access to all of the cool things

that transistors do so now when you have

a network of cells not only do they do

they talk to each other but they can

send messages to each other and the

differences of voltage can propagate now

to neuroscientists this is old hat

because you see this in the brain right

this action potential is the you know

the electricity

um you can you can they have they have

these awesome movies where you can take

a zebra like a transparent animal like a

zebrafish you can literally look down

and you can see all the all the firings

as the fish is like making decisions

about what to eat and things like this

right it's amazing well your whole body

is doing that all the time just much

slower so there are very few things that

neurons do that other cells that all the

cells in your body don't do they all

they all do very similar things just on

a much slower time scale and whereas

your brain is thinking about thing how

to uh solve problems in

three-dimensional space the cell embryo

are thinking about how to solve problems

in anatomical space they're trying to

have memories like hey how many fingers

are we supposed to have well how many do

we have now what do we do to get from

here to there that's the kind of

problems they're thinking about and the

reason that Gap Junctions are magic is

Imagine right from the from the from the

earliest from the earliest time

I'm here are two cells this cell uh how

can they communicate well well the

simple version is this cell could send a

chemical a chemical signal it floats

over and it hits a receptor on this cell

right

because it comes from outside this cell

can very easily tell that that came from

outside it's this is whatever

information is coming that's not my

information that information is coming

from the outside so I can I can trust it

I can ignore it I can do various things

with it whatever but I know it comes

from the outside now imagine instead

that you have two cells with a gap

Junction between them something happens

let's say the cell gets poked there's a

calcium Spike the calcium Spike or

whatever small molecule signal

propagates through the Gap Junction to

the cell there's no ownership metadata

on that signal this cell does not know

now that it's didn't that it came from

outside because it looks exactly like

its own memories would have looked like

of being of being of whatever had

happened right so Gap Junctions to some

extent wipe ownership information on

data which means that if I can't if if

you and I are sharing memories and we

can't quite tell who the memories belong

to that's the beginning of a mind melt

that's the beginning of a scale up of

cognition from here's me and here's you

two no now there's just us so they

enforce the collective intelligence

that's our Gap Junction that's right it

helps it's the beginning it's not the

the whole story by any means but it's

the start where's State stored

of the system so there's some is it in

part in the Gap Junctions themselves is

it in the cells there are many many

layers to this as always in biology so

there are

um uh chemical networks so for example

Gene regulatory networks right which

which are or basically any kind of

chemical pathway where different

chemicals activate and repress each

other they can store memories so in the

dynamical system sense they can store

memories they can they can get into

stable states that are hard to pull them

out of right so that's that becomes once

they get in that's a memory a permanent

memory of so or a semi-permanent memory

of something that's happened there are

cytoskeletal structures right that are

physically they store they store

memories in in physical configuration

there are uh electrical memories like

flip-flops where there is no physical

right so so if you look at it I show my

students this example as a flip-flop and

the reason that it stores a zero one is

not because some some uh piece of the

hardware moved it's because there's a

there's a cycling of the current in one

side of the thing if I come over and I

hold

um you know I hold the other side to uh

to a high voltage for for you know a

brief period of time it flips over and

now it's here but the heart none of the

hardware moved the information is in a

stable dynamical sense and if you were

to x-ray the thing you couldn't tell me

if it was zero or one because all you

would see is where the hardware is you

wouldn't see the the energetic state of

the system so there are also so there

are bioelectrical states that are held

in that exact way like like volatile Ram

basically like in the in the electrical

status it's very akin to

the different ways the memory is stored

in a computer

so there's Ram there's hard drives you

can make that mapping right so I think

the interesting thing is that based on

the biology we can have a more

sophisticated you know I think we can

revise some of our some of our um

Computer Engineering methods because

there are some interesting things that

biology does we haven't done yet but but

you can but that map but that mapping is

not bad I mean I think it works in many

ways yeah I wonder because I mean the

way we build computers at the root of

computer science is the idea of proof of

correctness we program things to be

perfect

reliable

you know this idea of resilience and

robustness to unknown conditions is not

as important so that's what biology is

really good at so I don't know what kind

of systems I don't know how we go from a

computer to a biological system in the

future yeah I think that you know you

know the thing about biology like is is

all about making really important

decisions really quickly on very limited

information I mean that's what biology

is all about you have to act you have to

act now that Stakes are very high and

you don't know most of what you need to

know to be perfect and so there's not

even an attempt to be to be perfect or

to get it right in any sense there are

just uh things like active inference

minimize surprise optimize uh some some

efficiency and and some things like this

that that guides the whole the whole

business I mentioned to uh Offline that

um somebody is a Affinity work is Andre

capathi and he's uh amongst many things

also uh writes occasionally a great blog

he came up with this idea I don't know

if he coined the term but of software

2.0 uh where the programming is done in

the space of configuring these

artificial neural networks

is there some sense in which that would

be the future of programming for us

humans where we're

less doing like python-like programming

and more

um

how would you how would that look like

but basically doing the hyper parameters

of something akin to a biological system

and watching it Go and keeping it

adjusting it and creating some kind of

feedback loop within the system so

correct itself yeah and then we watch it

over time

accomplished the goals we wanted to

accomplish is that kind of the the dream

of the the dogs that you described in

the nature paper yeah yeah I mean that's

what you just painted is a very good um

description of our efforts at

regenerative medicine as a kind of

somatic Psychiatry so the idea is that

you're not you know you're not trying to

micromanage I mean think about the

limitations of of a lot of the medicines

today we try to

interact down at the level of Pathways

right so so we're trying to micromanage

it what what's the problem well one

problem is that for almost every

medicine other than antibiotics once you

stop it the problem comes right back you

haven't fixed anything you were

addressing symptoms you weren't actually

curing anything again except for

antibiotics uh that's one problem the

other problem is you have massive amount

of side effects because you were trying

to interact at the lowest level it's

right it's like I'm gonna you know I'm

gonna I'm gonna try to program this

computer by changing the the melting

point of copper like maybe you can do

things that way but my God it's hard to

to program it right at the hardware

level so what what I think we're we're

starting to understand is that and and

by the way this goes back to what you

were saying before about uh that we

could have access to our internal state

right so people who practice that kind

of stuff right so yoga and then

biofeedback and those those are all the

people that uniformly will say things

like well the body has an intelligence

in the scenario like those two sets

overlap perfectly because because that's

exactly right because once you once you

start thinking about it that way you

realize that the better locus of control

is not always at the lowest level this

is why we don't all program with a

soldering iron right we we we take

advantage of of the high level

intelligences that are there which means

trying to figure out okay which of your

tissues can learn what can they learn uh

what you know why is it that um certain

drugs stop working after you take them

for a while with this habituation right

and so can we understand habituation

sensitization associative learning and

these kinds of things in chemical

Pathways we're going to have a

completely different way I think

um we're gonna have a completely

different way of of using drugs and of

medicine in general when we start

focusing on the goal state States and on

the intelligence of our subsystems as

opposed to treating everything as if the

only path was micromanagement from

chemistry upwards well can you speak to

this idea of somatic Psychiatry what are

somatic cells how do they form

networks that use bioelectricity to have

memory and all those kinds of things

yeah what are somatic cells like Basics

here systematic cells just means the

cells of your body so much just means

body right so so somatic cells are just

this I'm not even specifically making a

distinction between somatic cells and

stem cells or anything like that I mean

basically all the cells in your body not

just neurons but all the cells in your

body

they form electrical networks during

embryogenesis during regeneration what

those networks are doing

in part is processing information about

what our current shape is and what the

goal shape is now how do I know this

because I can give you a couple of

examples one one example is when we

Planaria
started studying this we said okay

here's a here's a planarian a planarian

is a flatworm it has one head and one

tail normally and the amazing the

several amazing things about planaria

but basically they kind of I think I

think planaria hold the answer to pretty

much every deep question of life for one

thing they're similar to our ancestors

so they have true symmetry they have a

true brain they're not like earthworms

they're you know they're much more

advanced life form they have lots of

different internal organs but they're

these little um they're about you know

maybe two centimeters in in the

centimeter to two in size

I have a head and a tail and the first

thing is plenary are Immortal so they do

not age there's no such thing as an old

planarian so that right there tells you

that these theories of thermodynamic

limitations of on lifespan are wrong

it's not it's not that well over time of

everything degrades no planaria can keep

it going for uh probably you know how

long have they've been around 400

million years right so these are the

actual so the plenary in our lab are

actually in physical continuity with

planaria that we're here 400 million

years ago so there's planaria that have

lived that long essentially what does it

mean physical continuity because because

what they do is they split in half the

way they reproduce is they split in half

so so the planarian the back the back

end grabs the petri dish the front end

takes off and then they rip themselves

in half but is it isn't in some sense

where

like you are a physical continuation Yes

except that except that we go through a

bottleneck of one cell which is the egg

they do not I mean they can there's

certain planarians so we go through a

very uh ruthless compression process and

they don't yes like an auto encoder you

know squash down to one cell and then

back out these these guys just tear

themselves in half and then each and

then and so the other amazing thing

about them is they regenerate so you can

cut them into pieces the record is I

think 276 or something like that by

Thomas Hunt Morgan uh and each piece

regrows a perfect little worm they know

exactly every piece knows exactly what's

missing what needs to happen uh in fact

in fact if you chop it in half as it

grows the other half uh the original the

original tissue shrinks so that when the

new tiny head shows up they're

proportional so it keeps it keeps

perfect proportion if you if you starve

them they shrink if you feed them again

they expand their control their

anatomical control is is just insane

somebody cut them into over 200 pieces

yeah yeah Thomas Hunt Morgan did hashtag

science yeah amazing yeah and maybe more

I mean they didn't have antibiotics back

then I bet he lost some due to infection

I bet I bet it's actually more than that

you could I bet you could do more than

that humans can do that

because well yeah yes I mean again true

I accept that you can't at the embryonic

level well that's that's the thing right

so so I tell when I talk about this I

said just remember that is as amazing as

it is to grow a whole planarian from a

tiny fragment half of the human

population can grow a full body from one

cell right so so development is really

you can look at development as a as a

just an example of regeneration yeah to

think we'll talk about regenerative

medicine but there's some sense what

would be like that warm in like 500

years ago

regrow hand yep I with we're given time

it takes time to grow large things but

for now yeah I think so I think you can

probably why not accelerate oh biology

takes his time I'm not going to say

anything is impossible but I don't know

of a way to accelerate these processes I

think it's possible I think we are going

to be regenerative but I don't know of a

way to make it fast if you just think

people from a few centuries from now be

like well they have to they used to have

to wait a week for the hand to regrow

it's like when the microwave was

invented you can you can toast your

um what's that called when you put a

cheese on a toast

um

foreign

all right so uh planaria why were we

talking about the magical planaria that

they have the Mystery of Life yeah so

the reason we're talking about plenary

is not only are they Immortal okay not

only do they regenerate every part of

the body uh they do they generally don't

get cancer right so which we can talk

about why that's important they're smart

they can learn things so you can train

them and it turns out that if you train

a planarian and then cut their heads off

the tail will regenerate a brand new

brain that still remembers the original

information do they have a biological

Network going on or no yes so their

somatic cells are forming a network and

that's that's what you mean by true

brain what's the requirement for a true

brain I I like everything else it's a

Continuum but but a true brain has

certain characteristics as far as the

density like a localized density of

neuronsa guides behavior in the head

exactly exactly if you cut their head

off uh the the tail doesn't have that

doesn't do anything it just sits there

until the new brain is is you know until

a new brain regenerates they have all

the same neurotransmitters that you and

I have but here's why here's what we're

talking about them in in this in this

context so here's your plenary you cut

off the head you cut off the tail you

have a middle fragment that middle

fragment has to make one head and one

tail how does it know how many of each

to make and where do they go how come it

doesn't switch how come

so so we did a very simple uh thing and

we said okay let's let's make the

hypothesis that there's a somatic

electrical Network that remembers the

correct pattern and then what it's doing

is is recalling that memory and building

to that pattern so what we did was we

used a um a way to visualize electrical

activity in these cells right it's a

it's a it's a variant of what people use

to look for electricity in the brain and

we saw that it has a that that fragment

has a very very particular electrical

pattern you can literally see it once

once we developed a technique it has a

very particular electrical pattern that

shows you where the head and the tail

goes right you can you can just see it

and then we said okay well now let's

test the idea that that's a memory that

actually controls where the head and the

tail goes let's change that pattern so

basically incept a false memory and so

what you can do is you can do that in

many different ways one way is with

drugs the target ion channels to say and

so you pick these drugs and you say okay

I'm going to do it so that instead of so

that instead of this one head one tail

electrical pattern you have a two-headed

pattern right you're just editing the

electrical information in the in the

network when you do that guess what the

cells build they build a two-headed worm

and the coolest thing about it now no

genetic changes so we haven't touched

the genome The genome is totally wild

type but the amazing thing about it is

that when you take these two-headed

animals and you cut them into pieces

again

some of those pieces will continue to

make two-headed animals

so so that information that that memory

that that electrical circuit not only

does it hold the information for how

many heads not only does it use that

information to tell the cells what to do

to regenerate but it stores it once

you've reset it it keeps and we can go

back we can take a two-headed animal and

put it back to one-headed so now imagine

so there's a couple of interesting

things here that um that have

implications for understanding what web

genomes and things like that imagine I

take this two-headed animal

um oh and by the way when they reproduce

when they tear themselves in half you

still get two-headed animals so imagine

they take them I throw them in the

Charles River over here so 100 years

later some scientists come along and

they scoop up some samples and they go

oh here's a single headed form in a

two-headed form wow a speciation event

cool let's sequence The genome and see

why what happened the genomes are

identical there's nothing wrong with the

genome so if you ask the question how

does so so this goes back to your very

first question is where do body plants

come from right how does the planarian

know how many heads it's supposed to

have now it's interesting because you

could say DNA but what hap what what as

it turns out the DNA produces a piece of

of Hardware that by default

says one head the way that when you turn

on a calculator by default it's a zero

every single time right when you turn it

on just a zero but it's a programmable

calculator as it turns out so once

you've changed that next time it won't

say zero it'll say something else and

the same thing here so you can make you

can make one-headed two-headed you can

make no headed worms we've done some

other things along these lines some

other really weird constructs

so so this this is this this question

all right so again it's really important

the the hardware software distinction is

really important because the hardware is

essential because without proper

Hardware you're never going to get to

the right physiology of having that

memory but once you have it it doesn't

fully determine what the information is

going to be you can have other

information in there and it's

reprogrammable by us by bacteria by

various parasites probably

um things like that the other amazing

thing about these planarias think about

this most animals when we get a mutation

in our bodies our children don't inherit

it right so you could go on you could

run around for 50 60 years getting

mutations your children don't have those

mutations because we go through the egg

stage planaria tear themselves in half

and that's how they reproduce so for 400

million years they keep every mutation

that they've had that doesn't kill the

cell that it's in so when you look at

these planaria their bodies are what's

called mixoploid meaning that every cell

might have a different number of

chromosomes they look like a tumor if

you look at the the the the the the the

the the the genome is an incredible mess

because they accumulate all this stuff

and yet the the their body structure is

they are the best regenerators on the

planet their Anatomy is Rock Solid even

though their genome is always all kinds

of crap so this is uh kind of a scandal

right that you know when we learn that

well you know what are genomes to what

genomes determine your body okay why is

the animal with the worst genome have

the best anatomical control the most

cancer resistant the most regenerative

right really we're just beginning to

start to understand this um relationship

between the genomically determined

hardware and and by the way just as a as

of a couple of months ago I think I now

somewhat understand why this is but it's

really it's really a major you know a

major puzzle I mean that really throws a

wrench into the whole

nature versus nurture

because you usually associate

electricity within with the nurture

and the hardware with the nature as

there's just this weird integrated mess

yeah that propagates to Generations yeah

it's much more fluid it's much more

complex

um you can you can imagine what's what's

happening here is just imagine the

evolution of a of an animal like this

that multi-skillers goes back to this

multi-scale competency right imagine

that you have two two you have an animal

that um that where it's it's tissues

have some degree of multi-scale

Competency so for example if the like

like we saw in the tadpole you know if

you put an eye on its tail they can

still see out of that eye right that the

you know there's all this incredible

plasticity so if you have an animal and

it comes up for selection and uh the

fitness is quite good

Evolution doesn't know whether the

fitness is good because the genome was

awesome or because the genome was kind

of junky but but the competency made up

for it right and things kind of ended up

good so what that means is that the more

competency you have the harder it is for

selection to pick the best genomes it

hides information right and so that

means that uh so so what happens you

know Evolution starts basically starts

although start all the hard work is

being done to increase the competency

because it's harder and harder to see

the genomes and so I think in planaria

what happened is that there's this

runaway phenomenon where all the effort

went into the algorithm such that we

know you got a crappy genome we can't

keep we can't clean up the genome we

can't keep track of it so what what's

going to happen is what survives are the

algorithms that can create a great worm

no matter what the genome is so

everything went into the algorithm and

which which of course then reduces the

pressure on keeping a you know keeping a

clean genome so this idea of right and

different animals have this in different

to different levels but this idea of

putting energy into an algorithm that

does not over train on priors right it

can't assume I mean I think biology is

this way in general Evolution doesn't

take the past too seriously because it

makes these basically problem-solving

machines as opposed to like exactly what

you know to to deal with exactly what

happened last time yeah problem solving

versus memory recall so a little memory

but a lot of problems so I think so yeah

in many cases yeah problem solving

foreign

I mean it's incredible that those kinds

of systems are able to be constructed

um especially how much they contrast

with the way we build problem solving

systems in the AI world

Building xenobots
um back to xenobots

I'm not sure if we ever described

housing about our bill but I mean you

have a paper titled biological robots

perspectives on an emerging

interdisciplinary field and the

beginning you uh you mentioned that the

word zenobots is like

controversial do you guys get in trouble

for using xenobots or what do people not

like the words endobots are you trying

to be provocative with the word xenobots

versus biological robots I don't know

this yeah is there some drama that we

should be aware of so there's a little

bit of drama uh I think I think the

drama is basically related to people

um having very fixed ideas about what

terms mean and I think in many cases

these ideas are completely out of date

with with where science is now and for

sure they're they're out of date with

what's going to be I mean these these

Concepts uh are not going to survive the

next couple of decades so if you ask a

person and including um you know a lot

of people in biology who kind of want to

keep a sharp distinction between

Biologicals and robots right see what's

a robot well a robot it comes out of a

factory it's made by humans it is boring

it is a meaning that you can predict

everything it's going to do it's made of

metal and certain other inorganic

materials living organisms magical they

they arise right and so on so there's

these distinctions I think these these

distinctions I think were were never

good but uh they're going to be

completely useless going forward and so

part of there's a couple of papers that

that's one paper and there's another one

that Josh bongard and I wrote where we

really attacked the terminology and we

say these binary categories are based on

very

um non-essential kind of surface uh

limitations of of technology and

Imagination that were true before but

they've got to go and so and so we call

them xenobot so so Zeno for xenopus

lavis whether it's the frog that these

guys are made of but we think it's an

example of of of of a biobot technology

because

ultimately if we if we under once we

understand how to uh communicate and

manipulate

um the inputs to these cells we will be

able to get them to build whatever we

want them to build and that's robotics

right it's it's the rational

construction of machines that have

useful purposes I I absolutely think

that this is a robotics platform whereas

some biologists don't but it's built in

a way that

uh all the different components of doing

their own computation so in a way that

we've been talking about so you're

trying to do top down control now that's

a biological system and in the future

all of this will will merge together

because of course at some point we're

going to throw in synthetic biology

circuits right new new um you know new

transcriptional circuits to get them to

do new things of course we'll throw some

of that in but we specifically stayed

away from all of that because in the

first few papers and there's some more

coming down the pike that are I think

going to be pretty pretty Dynamite

um that uh we want to show what the

native cells are made of because what

happens is you know if you engineer the

heck out of them right if we were to put

in new you know new transcription

factors and some new metabolic machinery

and whatever people will say well okay

you engineered this and you made it do

whatever and fine

I wanted to show uh and and the whole

team uh wanted to show the plasticity

and the intelligence and the biology

what does it do that's surprising before

you even start manipulating the hardware

in that way yeah don't try to uh Over

Control the thing Let It flourish

the the full beauty of the biological

system why xenopus love is how do you

pronounce it for slavis yeah yeah it's a

very why this frog it's been used since

I think the 50s uh it's just very

convenient because you can you you know

we keep the adults in this in this very

fine frog habitat they lay eggs they lay

tens of thousands of eggs at a time

um the eggs develop right in front of

your eyes it's the most mad magical

thing you can you can see because

normally you know if you were to deal

with mice or rabbits or whatever you

don't see the early stages right because

everything's inside the mother here

everything's in a Petri dish at room

temperature so you just you you have an

egg it's fertilized and you can just

watch it divide and divide and divide

and on all the organs form you can just

see it and at that point

um the community has has developed lots

of different tools for

understanding what's going on and also

but for manipulating right so it's

people use it for um you know for

understanding birth defects and

neurobiology and cancer Immunology also

so you get the whole uh embryogenesis in

the pizza dish

that's so cool to watch Is there videos

of this oh yeah yeah there's been yeah

there's there's amazing videos on on

online I mean mammalian embryos are

super cool too for example monozygotic

twins are what happens when you cut a

mammalian embryo in half you don't get

two half bodies you get two perfectly

normal bodies because it's a

regeneration event right a development

is just it's just the kind of

regeneration really and why this

particular frog is just uh because they

were doing in the 50s and it breeds well

in um you know in in case it's easy to

raise in in the laboratory and uh it's

very prolific and all the tools

basically for decades people have been

developing tools there's other some

people use other frogs but I have to say

this is this is this is important

xenobots are fundamentally not anything

about frogs so

um I I can't say too much about this

because it's not published and

peer-reviewed yet but we've made

xenobots out of other things that have

nothing to do with frogs it's this is

not a frog phenomenon this is it we

started with frog because it's so

convenient but this this plasticity is

not a fraud you know it's not related to

the fact that their frogs what happens

when you kiss it does it turn to a

prince no or princess which way uh

Prince yeah princess yeah that's an

experiment I don't believe we've done

and if we have I don't know we'll

collaborate I can I can take on the lead

uh on that effort okay cool uh how does

the cells coordinate let's focus in on

just the embryogenesis so there's one

cell

so it divides doesn't have to be very

careful about what each cell starts

doing once they divide yes and like yeah

when there's three of them it's like the

co-founders or whatever like what like

slow down you're responsible for this

when do they become specialized and how

do they coordinate that specialization

so so this is the the basic science of

Developmental biology there's a lot

known about all of that but um but what

I'll tell you what I think is the kind

of the most important part which is yes

it's very important who does what

however because going back to this issue

of of well I made this claim that

um biology doesn't take the past too

seriously and what I mean by that is it

doesn't assume that everything is the

way it's it's expected to be right and

here's an example of that

um this was this was done this was this

was an old experiment going back to the

40s but um basically imagine it's a newt

the salamander it's got these little two

tubules that go to the kidneys right

there's a little tube take a cross

section of that tube you see eight to

ten cells that have cooperated to make

this little tube and cross-section right

so one amazing one amazing thing you can

do is

um you can you can mess with the very

early cell division to make the cells

gigantic bigger you can you can make

them different sizes you can force them

to be different sizes so if you make the

cells different sizes the Whole Nude is

still the same size so if you take a

cross section through the through that

tubule instead of eight to ten cells you

might have four or five or you might

have you know three until you make the

cells so enormous that one single cell

wraps around itself

and and gives you that same large-scale

structure by a completely different

molecular mechanism so now instead of

cell to cell communication to make a

tubule instead of that it's one cell

using the cytoskeleton to bend itself

around so think about what that means in

the service of a large scale it talk

about top-down control right and the

service of a large scale anatomical

feature different molecular mechanisms

get called up so now think about this

you're you're you're you're a nude

selling trying to make an embryo if you

had a fixed idea of who was supposed to

do what you'd be screwed because now

your cells are gigantic nothing would

work the there's an incredible tolerance

for changes in the size of the parts in

the amount of DNA in those parts

um all sorts of stuff you can you can

the life is highly interoperable you can

put electrodes in there you can put

weird nanomaterials it still works it's

it's uh this is that problem solving

action right it's able to do what it

needs to do even when circumstances

change that is you know uh the Hallmark

of intelligence right William James

defined intelligence as the ability to

get to the same goal by different means

that's this you get to the same goal by

completely different means and so so why

am I bringing this up is just to say

that yeah it's important for the cells

to do the right stuff but they have

incredible tolerances for things not

being what you expect and to still get

their job done so if you're you know all

of these things are not hardwired there

are organisms that might be hardwired

for example the nematode C elegans in

that organism every cell is numbered

meaning that every AC Elegance has

exactly the same number of cells as

every other C elegans they're all in the

same place they all divide there's

literally a map of how it works that in

that in that sort of system it's it's

much more cookie cutter but but most

most organisms are incredibly plastic in

that way is there something particularly

magical to you about the whole

developmental biology process

is there something you could say because

you just said it they're very good at

accomplishing the goal of the job they

need to do the competency thing but you

get freaking organism for one cell

it's like uh

it's very hard

to Intuit that whole process

to even think about reverse engineering

that process right they're very hard to

the point where I often just imagine I I

sometimes ask my students to do this

thought experiment imagine you were you

were shrunk down to the to the scale of

a single cell and you were in the middle

of an embryo and you were looking around

at what's going on and the cells running

around some cells are dying it you know

every time you look it's kind of a

different number of cells for most

organisms and so I think that if you

didn't know what embryonic development

was you would have no clue that what

you're seeing is always going to make

the same thing never mind knowing what

that what that is never mind being able

to say even with full genomic

information being able to say what the

hell are they building we have no way to

do that but but just even to Guess that

wow the the the outcome of all this

activity is it's always going to be it's

always going to build the same thing the

imperative to create the final you as

you are now is there already

so you can you would so if you start

from the same embryo you create a very

similar organism

yeah on except for cases like the

xenobots when you give them a different

environment they come up with a

different way to be adaptive in that

environment but overall I mean so so I

think so I think to you know kind of

um uh summarize it I think what

evolution is really good at is creating

Hardware that has a very stable Baseline

mode meaning that left to its own

devices it's very good at doing the same

thing but it has a bunch of

problem-solving capacity such that if

any if any assumptions don't hold if

your cells are a weird size or you get

the wrong number of cells or there's a

you know somebody stuck in electrode

halfway through the body whatever it

will still get most of what it needs to

do done

you've talked about the magic and the

power of biology here if we look at the

human brain how special is the brain in

this context you're kind of minimizing

the importance of the brain or lessening

it's we think of all the special

computation happens in the brain

everything else is like the help

you're kind of saying that the whole

thing is the whole thing is doing

computation

but nevertheless how special is the

human brain in this full context of

biology yeah I mean look there's no

getting away from the fact that the

human brain allows us to do things that

we could not do without it you can say

the same thing about the liver

this is true and so and so you know I I

my goal is not no you're right my goal

is you're just being polite to the brain

right now well looking a politician like

listen everybody has everybody has a

role yeah and it's very important role

that's right we have to acknowledge the

importance of the brain you know there

are more than enough people who are um

cheerleading the the brain right so so I

I don't feel like uh nothing I say is

going to reduce people's excitement

about the human brain and so so I I

emphasize others credit I don't think it

gets too much credit I think other

things don't get enough credit I think

the brain is is the human brain is

incredible and special and all that I

think other things need more credit and

and I also think that

this and I'm sort of this way about

everything I don't like binary

categories but almost anything I like a

Continuum and the thing about the human

brain is that it by by accepting that as

as some kind of an important category or

essential um essential thing we end up

with all kinds of weird pseudo problems

and conundrum so for example uh when we

talk about it you know if you don't want

to talk about

um uh uh ethics and other other things

like that uh and and what you know this

this idea that surely if we look out

into the universe surely we don't

believe that this human brain is the

only way to be sentient right surely we

don't you know and to have high level

cognition I just I can't even wrap my

mind around this this idea that that is

the only way to do it no doubt there are

other architectures made made of

completely different principles that

achieve the same thing and once we

believe that then that tells us

something important it tells us that

things that are not quite human brains

or chimeras of human brains and other

tissue or human brains or other kinds of

brains and novel configurations or

things that are sort of brains but not

really or plants or embryos or whatever

might also have important cognitive

status so that's the only thing I think

we have to be really careful about

treating the human brain as if it was

some kind of like sharp binary category

you know you are or you aren't I I don't

believe that exists so when we look out

at all the beautiful variety of

semibological architectures out there in

the universe how many how many

intelligent alien civilizations do you

think are out there yeah boy I have you

know no expertise in that whatsoever

yeah you haven't met any I I have met

the ones we've made I think that I mean

exactly in some sense with synthetic

biology are you not creating aliens I

absolutely think so because because look

all of life all of St all standard model

systems are an N of one course of

evolution on earth right and trying to

make conclusions about biology from

looking at life on Earth is like testing

your theory on the same data that

generated it it's all it's all kind of

like locked in so we absolutely have to

create novel uh examples that have no

history on Earth that don't you know as

xenobots have no history of selection to

be a good xenobot the cells have

selection for various things but but the

xenobot itself never existed before and

so we can make chimeras you know we make

frogalodels that are you know sort of

half frog have Axolotl you can make all

sorts of high brats right constructions

of living to issue with robots and

whatever we need to be making these

things until we find actual aliens

because otherwise we're just looking at

an N of one set of examples all kinds of

Frozen accidents of evolution and so on

we need to go beyond that to really

understand biology but we're still even

if you when you do a synthetic biology

you're locked in to the basic components

of the way biology is done on this Earth

yeah right yeah yeah

and also the basic constraints to the

environment even artificial environments

to construct in the lab are tied up to

the environment I mean what do you okay

let's say there is I mean what I think

is there's

a nearly infinite number of intelligent

civilizations living or dead out there

um

if you pick one out of the box

what do you think it would look like

so

in in when you think about synthetic

biology

or creating synthetic organisms

how hard is it to create something

that's very different

yeah I think it's very hard to create

something that's very different right

it's um uh we are just locked in both

both uh experimentally and in terms of

our imagination right it's very hard and

you also emphasize several times that

the idea of shape yeah the individual

cell get together with other cells and

they kind of

they're gonna build a shape so it's

shape and function but shape is a

critical thing yeah so here I'll take a

stab I mean I I agree with you to

whatever extent though that we can say

anything I I do think that there's you

know probably an infinite number of of

different uh different

um uh architectures with with that are

with interesting cognitive properties

out there uh what can we say about them

I think that

um the only things that are going I I

don't think we can rely on any of the

typical stuff you know carbon based yeah

no no like I think all of that is just

um you know us being having having a

lack of imagination but I think the

things that um are going to be Universal

if anything is are things for example

driven by resource limitation the fact

that you are fighting a hostile world

and you have to draw a boundary between

yourself and the world somewhere the

fact that that boundary is not given to

you by anybody you have to you have to

assume it you know uh estimate it

yourself and the fact that you have to

coarse grain your experience and the

fact that you're going to try to

minimize surprise and the fact that like

these these are the things that I think

are fundamental about biology none of

the you know the facts about the genetic

code or even the fact that we have genes

or or the biochemistry of it I don't

think any of those things are

fundamental but um it's going to be a

lot more about the information and about

the creation of the self the fact that

so in my in my framework selves are

demarcated by uh the scale of the goals

that they can pursue so from little tiny

local goals to like massive you know

planetary scale goals for for certain

humans

um and everything and everything in

between so you can draw this like

cognitive light cone about that that

determines the the scale of the goals

you could possibly pursue I think those

kinds of Frameworks uh like that like

active inference and so on are going to

be universally applicable but but none

of the other things that are that are

typically um discussed

quick pause during the bathroom break

we were just talking about uh you know

aliens and all that that's a funny thing

which is yeah I don't know if you've

seen them there's a kind of debate that

goes on about cognition and plants and

what can you say about different kinds

of computation and cognition implants

and I always I always look at that

something like if if you're weirded out

by cognition in Plants you're not ready

for exobiology right if if you know

something that's that similar here on

Earth is already like freaking you out

then I think there's going to be all

kinds of cognitive life out there that

we're gonna have a really hard time

recognizing

I think robots will help us yeah

like expand our mind about cognition

either that or the word like xenobots so

and they maybe becomes the same thing it

is you know really when the human

Engineers the thing at least in part and

then is able to achieve some kind of

cognition that's different than what

you're used to then you start to

understand like oh

cut you know every living organism is

capable of cognition oh I need to kind

of broaden my understanding what

cognition is but do you think plants um

like when you when you eat them are they

screaming I don't know about screaming I

think you have to see what I think when

I eat a salad yeah good yeah I think you

have to scale down the expectations in

terms of right so so probably they're

not screaming in the way that we would

be screaming however there's plenty of

data on Plants being able to um to do

anticipation and certain kinds of memory

and and so on

um I think you know what you just said

about robots uh I I hope you're right

and I hope that's but but there's two

there's two ways that people can take

that right so one way is exactly what

you just said to try to kind of expand

their expand their their their Notions

for that category the other way people

often go is uh they just sort of Define

the term as if if it's not a natural

product it's it's just faking right it's

not really intelligence if it was made

by somebody else because it's that same

it's the same thing they can see how

it's done and once you see how it's like

a magic trick when you see how it's done

it's not as fun anymore and and I think

people have a real tendency for that and

they sort of which which I find really

strange in the sense that if somebody he

said to me

we have this this sort of blind like

like uh hill climbing search and then

and then we have a really smart team of

Engineers which one do you think is

going to produce a system that has good

intelligence I think it's really weird

to say that it only comes from the blind

search right it can't be done by people

who by the way can also use evolutionary

techniques if they want to but also

rational design I think it's really

weird to say that

um real intelligence only comes from

Natural Evolution

so I hope you're right I hope people

take it the other the other way but

there's a nice shortcut so I work with

Lego robots a lot now from for my own uh

personal pleasure not in that way

internet uh so the four legs

and uh one of the things that

changes my experience with the robots a

lot is um

when I can't understand why I did a

certain thing and there's a lot of ways

to engineer that

meet the person that created the

software that runs it

there's a lot of ways for me to build

that software in such a way that I don't

exactly know why it did a certain basic

decision

of course as an engineer you can go in

and start to look at logs you can log

all kind of data sensory data the the

decisions you made you know all the

outputs and neural networks and so on

but I also try to really experience that

surprise and that really experience as

another person would that totally

doesn't know how it's built and I think

the magic is there and not knowing how

it works

that I think biology does that for you

through the layers of abstraction yeah

it because nobody really knows what's

going on inside the biological like each

one component is clueless about the big

picture I think there's actually really

cheap systems that can that can

illustrate that kind of thing which is

even like um you know uh fractals right

like you have a very small short formula

in Z and you see it and there's no magic

you're just going to crank through you

know Z squared plus C whatever you're

just going to crank through it but the

result of it is this incredibly Rich

beautiful image right that that just

like wow all of that was in this like 10

character long string like amazing so

the fact that you can you can know

everything there is to know about the

details and the process and all the

parts and everything like there's

literally no magic of any kind there and

yet the outcome is something that you

would never have expected and it's just

it just you know is incredibly rich and

complex and beautiful so there's a lot

Unconventional cognition
of that you write that you work on

developing conceptual Frameworks for

understanding unconventional cognition

so the kind of thing we've been talking

about I just like the term

unconventional cognition

and you want to figure out how to detect

study and communicate with a thing

you've already mentioned a few examples

but what is unconventional cognition is

it as simply as everything outside of

what we Define usually as cognition

cognitive science the stuff going on

between our ears or is there some deeper

way to get at the fundamentals of

what is cognition

yeah I think like uh and and if I'm

certainly not the only person who works

in unconvention unconventional um

cognition so it's the term used yeah

that's one that so I've coined a number

of weird terms but that's not one of

mine like that that's an existing thing

so so for example somebody like Andy

adamasky who um I don't know if you've

if you've had him on if you haven't you

you should he's a he's a he's a you know

very interesting guy he's a computer

scientist and he does unconventional

cognition and Sly molds and all kinds of

weird um he's a real weird weird cat

really interesting anyway so so that's

on you know there's a bunch of terms

that I've come up with but that's not

one of mine so I think like many terms

that one is is really defined by the

times meaning that unconventional

cognitive thing things that are

unconventional cognition today are not

going to be considered unconventional

cognition at some point uh it's one of

those it's one of those things and so

it's you know it's it's it's this it's

this really deep question of how do you

recognize communicate with

um um classify cognition when you cannot

rely on the typical Milestones right so

so typical

um you know again if you stick with the

with the uh the history of life on earth

like these these exact model systems you

would say ah here's a particular

structure of the brain and this one has

fewer of those and this one has a bigger

frontal cortex and this one right so

these are these are landmarks that that

we're that we're used to and and it

allows us to make very um kind of Rapid

judgments about things but if you can't

rely on that either because you're

looking at a synthetic thing or or an

engineered thing or an alien thing then

what do you do right how do you and so

and so that's what I'm really interested

I'm interested in mind in all of its

possible implementations not just the

obvious ones that we know from from

looking at brains here on Earth

whenever I think about something like

unconventional cognition I think about

cellular automata I'm just captivated by

the beauty of the thing

the fact that from simple little

uh objects you can create some such

beautiful complexity that very quickly

you forget about the individual objects

and you see the things that it creates

as its own organisms that blows my mind

every time like honestly

I could full time just

eat mushrooms and watch cellular time

don't you have to do mushrooms uh just

just sell your automata it feels like I

mean from an engineering perspective I

love

when a very simple system captures

something really powerful because then

you can study that system to understand

something fundamental about complexity

about life on Earth

anyway how do I communicate with a thing

for cellular automata can can do

cognition if a plant can do cognition if

uh a xenobot can do cognition how do I

like whisper in its ear and and and get

an answer back to how do I have a

conversation yeah

um well how do I have a xenobot on a

podcast that's really a really

interesting line of um investigation

that that that that opens up I mean I

mean we thought about this so you need a

few things you need you need to

understand the space in which they live

so uh what not not just the physical

modality like can they see like can they

feel vibration I mean that's important

of course because that's how you deliver

your message but but not just not just

the ideas for a communication medium not

not just the physical medium but what is

saliency right so so what are these what

what are important to this what's

important to this system and systems of

all kinds of different levels of

sophistication of what you could expect

to get back and I I think what's what's

really important I call this um the the

spectrum of persuadability which is this

this idea that when you're looking at a

system you can't you can't assume where

on the Spectrum it is you have to do

experiments and so so for so so

uh for example uh if you look at a gene

regulatory Network which is just a bunch

of bunch of nodes that turn each other

on and off at various rates you might

look at that and you say wow there's no

magic here I mean clearly this thing is

uh is is as deterministic as it gets

it's a piece of Hardware the only way

we're going to be able to control it is

by rewiring it which is the way my

molecular biology works right we can add

nodes remove notes or whatever well so

we've done simulations and shown that

um biological and now we're doing this

in in the lab the biological networks

like that have have associative memory

so they can actually learn they can

learn from experience they have

habituation they have sensitization they

have associative memory which you

wouldn't have known if you assume that

they have to be on the left side of that

Spectrum so when you're going to

communicate with something and we've

even um uh uh Charles Abramson I've

written a paper on um behaviorist

approaches to synthetic organism meaning

that if you're given something you have

no idea what it is or what it can do how

do you figure out what its psychology is

what its level is what does it and so

and so we literally lay out a set of

protocols starting with the simplest

things that I'm moving up to more

complex things where you can make no

assumptions about what this thing can do

right just from you you have to start

and you'll find out

so so when you're gonna so so here's a

simple I mean here's one way to

communicate with something if you can

train it

that's a way of communicating so if you

can provide if you can figure out what

the currency of reward of positive and

negative reinforcement is right and you

can get it to do something it wasn't

doing before based on experiences you've

given it you have taught it one thing

you have communicated one thing that

that such and such an action is good so

some other action is is not good that's

that's like a basic atom of a primitive

atom of communication what about

in some sense if it gets you to do

something you haven't done before is it

answering back yeah most most certainly

and then there's there's I've seen

cartoons I think maybe Gary Larson or

somebody had had a cartoon of these of

these rats in the Maze and the one rat

you know assists to the other hey look

at this every time every time I walk

over here he starts scribbling in that

on the you know almost the clipboard

that he has it's awesome if we step

outside ourselves

and really measure how much like if I if

I actually measure how much I've changed

because of my interaction with certain

cellular automata and you really have to

take that it's a consideration about

like well these things are changing you

too yes I know you know how it works and

so on but you're being changed by the

thing absolutely I think I think I read

um I don't know any details but I I

think I read something about

um how how wheat and other things of

domesticated humans in terms right but

by their properties change the way that

the human behavior and societal

structures in that sense cats are

running the world

because they they took over the so first

of all so first they while not giving a

shit about humans clearly would ever

with with every ounce of their being

they've somehow got just millions and

millions of humans to to to to take them

home and feed them and then not only the

physical space that they take over they

took over the digital space they

dominate the internet in terms of

cuteness in terms of immutability

and so they're they're like they got

themselves literally inside the memes

they become viral and spread on the

internet

and they're the ones that are probably

controlling humans that's my theory

another that's a follow-up paper after

the frog kissing okay

I mean you mentioned

sentience and consciousness

uh you have a paper titled generalizing

Frameworks for sentience Beyond natural

species

so beyond

normal cognition if we look at

sentience and Consciousness and I wonder

if you draw an interesting distinction

between those two uh elsewhere

outside of humans and uh maybe outside

of Earth

you think aliens are half sentients and

if they do how do we think about it so

when you have this framework what is

this paper what is what is the way you

propose to think about ascensions yeah

that that particular paper was was a

very short um commentary on another

paper that was written about crabs

there's a really good paper on them uh

crabs and and various like like a rubric

of uh of different types of behaviors

that that could be applied to different

creatures and they're trying to apply it

to crabs and so on them I I've

Consciousness we can talk about a

feeling but it's a whole separate kettle

of fish I I I almost never talk about

crabs in this case yes I almost never

talk about Consciousness per se I've

said very very little about it but we

can we can talk about it if you want

mostly what I talk about is is cognition

because I think that that's much easier

to deal with in a um kind of rigorous

experimental experimental way I think

that um all of these all of these terms

have uh you know sentience and and so on

have different definitions and I

fundamentally I think that people can as

long as they specify what they mean

ahead of time

um I think people can Define them in

various ways the one the the the the

only thing that I really kind of insist

on is that

the right way to think about all this

stuff is is an energy from an

engineering perspective what does it

help me to to control predict and uh to

and does it help me do my next

experiment so so so so that that's

that's not a universal perspective so

some people have uh philosophical kind

of underpinnings and those are primary

and if anything runs against that then

it must automatically be wrong so so

some people will say I don't care what

else if your theory says to me that

thermostats have little tiny goals I'm

not I'm not I'm not so that's it I just

like that's my philosophical you know

preconception that like thermostats do

not have goals and that's it so um so

that's one way of doing it and some

people do it that way I do not do it

that way and I think that we can't if we

we can't I don't think we can know much

of anything from our from a

philosophical armchair I think that all

of these theories and ways of doing

things stand or fall based on just just

basically one set of criteria does it

help you run a rich research program

that's it if I agree with you totally

but so forget philosophy what about the

Poetry of ambiguity what about at the

limits of the things you can engineer

using terms that are that can be defined

in multiple ways

and living within that yeah

uncertainty in order to play with words

until something lands that you can

engineer I mean that's to me where

Consciousness sits currently nobody

really understands the the hard problem

of Consciousness is the subject what it

feels like because it really feels like

it feels like something to be this

biological system this conglomerate of a

bunch of cells in this hierarchy of

competencies feels like something and

yeah I feel like one thing and is that

just

is that just a as a side effect of a

complex system

or is there something more

that humans have or is there something

more than any biological system has some

kind of magic some kind of not just the

sense of agency but a real sense with a

capital letter s of agency yeah

uh boy uh yeah that's a deep question

now is there room for poetry and

Engineering or no no there definitely is

and a lot of the Poetry comes in when we

realize that none of the categories we

deal with are sharp as we think they are

right and so and so in the you know in

the different areas of of all these

Spectra are where a lot of the Poetry

sits I have many new theories about

things but I in fact do not have a a

good theory about Consciousness that I

plan to trot out so and you almost don't

see it as useful for your current work

unconsciousness I think it will come I

have some thoughts about it but I don't

feel like they're going to move the

needle yet on on that but do you want to

ground in in engineering always

so well

I mean I don't so so so so if we really

tackle Consciousness per se in terms of

the hard problem I don't I don't that

that isn't necessarily going to be

groundable in engineering right that

that aspect of the cognition is but

actual Consciousness per se you know for

first person perspective I'm not sure

that that's groundable in engineering

and I think specifically what's

different about what's different about

it is there's a couple things so so

let's you know here we go I'll say a

couple things about about Consciousness

one one thing is that what makes it

different is that for every other type

aspect of science

when we think about having a correct or

a good theory of it we have some idea of

what format it that theory makes

predictions in so whether those be

numbers or whatever we we have some idea

we may not know the answer we may not

have the theory but we know that when we

get the theory here's what it's going to

output and then we'll know if it's right

or wrong for actual Consciousness not

Behavior not neural correlates but

actual first person Consciousness if we

had a correct Theory Of Consciousness or

even a good one what the hell would what

what format would would it make

predictions in right because because all

the things that we know about it

basically boil down to observable

behaviors so the only thing I can think

of when I think about that is is is

it'll be poetry or it'll be it'll be

it'll be something to um if if I ask you

okay you've got a great Theory Of

Consciousness and here's this here's

this creature maybe it's a natural maybe

it's an engineer one whatever and I want

you to tell me what your theory says

about this this beings um what it's like

to be this being the only thing I can

imagine you giving me is some piece of

art a poem or or something that once

I've taken it in I share I I I I now

have a similar State as whatever that's

that's about as good as I can come up

with well it's possible that that once

you have a good understanding of

Consciousness it would be mapped to some

things that are more measurable so for

example it's possible that

a conscious being is one that's able to

suffer

so you start to look at pain and

suffering you can start to connect it

closer to

things that

you can measure that in terms of how

they reflect themselves in Behavior

and problem solving and uh creation and

attainment of goals for example which I

think suffering is one of the you know

life is suffering it's one of the one of

the big aspects of the The Human

Condition

and so if Consciousness is somehow a

maybe at least a catalyst for suffering

you could start to get like Echoes of it

and you start you you start to see like

the actual effects of Consciousness and

behavior that it's not just about

subjective experience it's like it's

really deeply integrated in the problem

solving uh decision making of a system

uh something like this but also it's

possible that we realize this is not a

philosophical statement philosophers can

write their books I welcome it uh you

know I I take the touring test really

seriously I I don't know why people

really don't like it

when a robot convinces you that it's

intelligent I think that's a really

incredible accomplishment and there's

some deep sense in which that is

intelligence

if it looks like it's intelligent it is

intelligent and I think there's some

deep aspect

of

um a system that appears to be conscious

it

in some deep sense it is conscious

for these for me we have to consider

that possibility and a system that

appears to be conscious

is an engineering challenge

yeah I don't disagree with any of that I

mean especially intelligence I think is

a publicly observable thing I I and and

I mean you know science fiction has

dealt with this for a century or or much

more maybe uh this idea that when you

are confronted with something that just

doesn't meet any of your typical

assumptions so you can't look in the

skull and say oh well there's that

frontal cortex so then I guess we're

good right if it's if it's you know so

so this thing lands on your front lawn

and this you know with the the little

door opens and something trundles out

and it's sort of like

um you know kind of shiny and aluminum

looking and it hands you this uh you

know it hands you this poem that it

wrote while it was on you know flying

over and how happy it is to meet you

like what's going to be your criteria

right for whether whether you get to

take it apart and see what makes a tick

or whether you have to you know be nice

to it and and whatever right like all

the all the criteria that we have now

and you know that people are using and

as you said a lot of people are down on

the touring tests and things like this

but but what else have we got you know

because measuring measuring a quart

excise isn't gonna isn't gonna cut it

right in the broader scheme of things so

uh I think this is it's it's a wide open

it's a wide open problem that right that

we you know our our solution to the

problem of other Minds it's very

simplistic right we we give each other

credit for having Minds just because we

sort of on uh you know on an anatomical

level we're pretty similar and then so

that's good enough but how how far is

that going to go so I think that's

really primitive so um yeah I think I

think it's a major unsolved problem it's

a really challenging

uh direction of thought to the human

race

uh that you talked about like embodied

Minds if you start to think that other

things other than humans have Minds

that's really challenging yeah because

all men are created equal starts

starts being like all right well we

should probably treat

not just cows with respect yeah but like

plants and not just plants but

uh some kind of organized conglomerates

of cells in a petri dish

in fact some of the work we're we're

doing like you're doing and the whole

community of science is doing with

Biology people might be like we weren't

really mean to viruses yeah

I mean yeah I the thing is you're right

and and I get I get I certainly get

phone calls about uh people complaining

about frog skin and so on but

I think we have to separate the sort of

deep philosophical aspects versus what

actually happened so what actually

happens on Earth is that people with

exactly the same anatomical structure

kill each other you know on a daily

basis right so so so it I think it's

clear that simply knowing that something

else is equally or maybe more uh

cognitive or conscious than you are is

is not a guarantee of of of kind

behavior that that much we know of so

then and so then then we look at a

commercial farming of mammals and

various other things and so so I think

on a practical basis long before we get

to worrying about

um things like frog skin we have to ask

ourselves why are we uh what what can we

do about the way that we've been

behaving with the towards creatures

which we know for a factor because of

our similarities are are basically just

like us you know that's kind of a whole

other this is a social thing but but but

fundamentally you know of course you're

absolutely right in that we we are also

thinking about this we are on this

planet in some way incredibly lucky it's

just dumb luck that we really only have

one dominant species it didn't have to

work out that way so you could easily

imagine that there could be a planet

somewhere with more than one equally or

maybe near equally intelligent species

and then uh but but then they may not

look anything like each other right so

there may be multiple ecosystems where

there are uh things of of similar to

human-like intelligence and then you'd

have all kinds of issues about you know

how do you how do you relate to them

when they're physically not like you at

all but yet yet you know in terms of

behavior and culture and whatever it's

pretty obvious that they've got as you

know as much on the ball as you have or

maybe imagine imagine that there was

another

um group of beings that was like on

average you know 40 IQ points lower

right like like we're just we're pretty

lucky in many ways we you know we don't

really have even though we we sort of

you know we still act badly in many ways

but but but the fact is you know all

humans are more or less in this like in

the same that same range but didn't have

to work out that way well but I think

that's part of the way life works on

Earth maybe human civilization works

is it seems like we want us ourselves to

be quite similar

and then within that you know what

everybody's about the same relatively IQ

intelligence problem solving

capabilities even physical

characteristics

but then we'll find some aspect of that

as different and that seems to be like

I mean it's it's really dark to say but

there seems to be the

I'm not even a bug but like a feature of

the early development of human

civilization you pick the other your

tribe versus the other tribe in your War

it's a kind of evolution evolution in

the space of of memes a space of ideas I

think a new war with each other so we're

very good at finding the other even when

the characteristics are really the same

that's I don't know what

that I mean I'm sure so many of these

things echo in the biological World in

some way yeah there's a fun um

experiment that uh I did my my son

actually came up with this so we we did

um a a biology unit together he would

use so homeschool and so we did this a

couple years ago we did this thing where

it imagines you get the sly mold right

and polycephalum and it grows on them uh

on a uh on a petri dish of agar and it

sort of spreads out and and it's it's

it's a single cell you know produce but

it's like this giant thing and so you

put down a piece of oat and it wants to

go get the oat and it sort of grows

towards the oat so what you do is you

take a razor blade and you just you just

separate the piece of the whole culture

that's growing towards the the oh you

just kind of separate it and so now

think about think about the interesting

decision-making calculus for that little

piece I can I can go get the oat and

therefore I won't have to share those

nutrients with this giant mass over

there so the so the nutrients per unit

volume is going to be amazing so I

should go ethio

but if I first rejoin because faizaram

once you cut it has the ability to join

back up if I first rejoin then that

whole calculus becomes impossible

because there is no more me anymore

there's just we and then and then we

will go eat this thing right so so this

interesting you know this this you can

imagine a kind of game theory where the

number of Agents isn't fixed and that

it's not just cooperate or defect but

it's actually merge and and whatever

right yeah so that kind of that that

competition how does it do that decision

making yeah so so that right so so it's

it's really interesting and so and so

empirically what we found is that it

tends to merge first it tends to merge

first and then the whole thing goes but

but it's really interesting that that

that that that calculus like do we even

have I mean I'm not an expert in the

economic Game Theory and all that but

maybe there's account maybe some sort of

hyperbolic discounting or something but

but maybe you know this idea that the

the actions you take not only change

your payoff but they change who or what

you are and that you may not you you

could take an action after which you

don't exist anymore or you are radically

changed or you are merged with somebody

else like that's I you know as far as I

know that's a whole you know we're still

missing a formalism for even knowing how

to how to model any of that DC evolution

Origin of evolution
by the way is a process that applies

here on Earth or is it some where did

Evolution come from yeah yeah so this

thing

um that from the very origin of life

that took us to today what what what the

heck is that I think evolution is

inevitable in the sense that if you

combine and and basically I think one of

the most uh useful things that was done

in early Computing I guess in the 60s it

started was was evolutionary computation

and just showing how how uh simple it is

that if you have if you have imperfect

heredity and competition together those

two things were three things right so

heredity imperfect heredity and

competition or selection those three

things and that's it now now now you're

you're off through the races right and

so that can be it's not just on Earth

because it can be done in the computer

it can be done in chemical systems it

can be done in um you know Elise Mullen

says it it works in on on you know

Cosmic scales so I think that uh that

kind of thing is incredibly

um pervasive and and and and general

it's a general feature of life it's it's

interesting to think about

you know the standard uh the standard

thought about this is that it's uh it's

blind right meaning that the the the

intelligence of the process is zero it's

stumbling around

and I think that back in the day when

the options with the options were it's

dumb like machines or it's smart like

humans then of course the scientists

went in this direction because nobody

wanted creationism and so they said okay

it's got to be like completely blind I'm

not actually sure right because because

I I think that um I think that

everything is a Continuum and I think

that it doesn't have to be smart with

foresight like us but it doesn't have to

be completely blind either I think there

may be aspects of it and in particular

this kind of multi-scale Competency

might give it a little bit of look ahead

maybe or a little bit of um problem

solving sort of baked in but but that's

going to be completely different in

different in different systems but I do

think I do think it's General I don't

think it's just on Earth I think it's a

very fundamental thing and it does seem

to have a kind of direction that is

taking us

that's somehow perhaps is defined by the

environment itself

it feels like we're headed towards

something

like

we're playing out a script that was just

like a single cell defines the entire

organism yeah it feels like from the

origin of Earth itself

playing out a kind of script yeah you

can't really go any other way I mean so

this is very controversial and I don't

know the answer but people have people

have argued that this is called uh you

know sort of rewinding the tape of life

right and and some people have argued I

think I think I think Conway Morris

maybe has argued that it it is that

there's a deep attractor for example to

human to the human um

uh kind of uh structure and that and

that if you were to rewind it again

you'd basically get more or less the

same thing and then other people have

argued that no it's it's incredibly

sensitive to Frozen accidents and then

once a certain stochastic decisions are

made Downstream everything is going to

be different I don't know I don't know

you know we're very bad at predicting uh

attractors in the space of complex

systems generally speaking right we

don't know so may so maybe Evolution on

Earth has these deep attractors that no

matter what has happened it pretty much

would likely to end up there or maybe

not I don't know what's a really

difficult idea to imagine that

if you ran Earth a million times 500 000

times you would get Hitler

like yeah we don't like to think like

that we think like because

at least maybe in America

you like to think that individual

decisions can change the world and if

individual decisions can change the

world then surely

any perturbation results in a totally

different trajectory but maybe there's a

in this competency hierarchy it's a

self-correcting system

that's just ultimately there's a bunch

of chaos that ultimately is leading

towards something like a super

intelligent artificial intelligence

system

the answers 42.

I mean there might be a kind of

imperative for life that is headed to

and we're too focused on our day-to-day

life of getting coffee and snacks and

having sex and getting uh a promotion at

work not to see the big imperative of

life on earth that is headed towards

something yeah maybe maybe I don't it's

it's it's difficult I think one of the

things that's important about

um

chimerica by engineer Technologies all

of those things are that we have to

start developing a better science of

predicting the cognitive goals of of

composite systems so we're just not very

good at it right we don't know uh if if

if if I create a composite system and

this could be internet of things or

swarm robotics or a cellular a cellular

swarm or whatever

what is the emergent intelligence of

this thing first of all what level is it

going to be at and if it has goal

directed capacity what are the goals

going to be like we are just not very

good at predicting that yet and I think

that uh it's it's a

it's a it's a existential level uh need

for us to be able to because we're

building these things all the time right

we're building we're building both

physical structures like swarm Robotics

and we're building uh a social Financial

structures and so on with very little

ability to uh predict what sort of

autonomous goals that system is going to

have of which we are now cogs and so

right so so learning learning to predict

and control those things is going to be

critical so we've so so in fact so so if

you're right and there is some kind of

attractor to Evolution it would be nice

to know what that is and then to make a

rational decision of whether we're going

to go along or we're going to pop out of

it or try to pop out of it because

there's no guarantee I mean that's

that's the other you know kind of

important thing a lot of people

I get a lot of complaints uh from from

people email me and say yeah you know

what you're doing uh it isn't natural

you know and I'll say look natural that

that'd be nice if if somebody was making

sure that natural was was was matched up

to our values but no one's doing that

but you know Evolution optimizes for

biomass that's it nobody's optimizing

it's not optimizing for your happiness

it's I don't think necessarily it's

optimizing for for for intelligence or

fairness or any of that stuff I'm gonna

find that person that emailed you beat

them up take their place

um steal everything they own and say now

we're now this is natural this is

natural yeah exactly because because it

comes from it comes from a from an old

world view where you could assume that

whatever is natural that that's probably

for the best and I think we're long out

of that Garden of Eden kind of view so I

think we can do better we I think we and

we have to right natural it just isn't

great for for a lot of a lot of life

forms what are some cool synthetic

Synthetic organisms
organisms that you you think about you

dream about out when you think about

embodied mind what do you imagine what

do you hope to build yeah on a practical

level what I really hope to do is to

gain enough of an understanding of the

embodied intelligence of the organs and

tissues such that we can achieve a

radically different regenerative

medicine so that we can say basically

and I I think about it as um you know in

terms of like okay can you what's the

what's the uh uh what's the goal kind of

uh and and end game for this whole thing

to me the end game is something that you

would call an anatomical compiler so the

idea is you would sit down in front of

the computer and you would draw the the

body or the organ that you wanted not

not molecular details but like this is

what I want I want a six-legged uh you

know frog with a propeller on top or I

want I want a heart that looks like this

or I want a leg that looks like this and

what it would do if we knew what we were

doing is

put out uh it could convert that

anatomical description into a set of

stimuli that would have to be given to

cells to convince them to build exactly

that thing right I probably won't live

to see it but I think it's achievable

and I think what that if if we can have

that then that is basically the solution

to all of medicine except for infectious

disease so birth defects right traumatic

injury cancer aging degenerative disease

if we knew how to tell cells what to

build all of those things go away so

those things go away and the um positive

feedback spiral of economic costs where

all of the advances are increasingly

more heroic and expensive interventions

of a sinking ship when you're like 90

and then and so on right all of that

goes away because basically instead of

trying to fix you up as you as you

degrade you you

um you progressively regenerate you know

you apply the regenerative medicine

early before things degrade so I think

that that'll have massive economic

impacts over what we're trying to do now

which is not at all you know sustainable

and uh and that that's what I hope I

hope that I hope that we get it so so to

me yes the xenobots will be doing useful

things cleaning up the environment

cleaning out you know your or you know

your joints and all that kind of stuff

but more important than that I think we

can use these synthetic systems to try

to understand to to develop a science of

detecting and manipulating the goals of

collective intelligences of cells

specifically for regenerative medicine

and then sort of beyond that if we you

know sort of think further beyond that

what I hope is that kind of like what

you said all of this drives a

reconsideration of how we formulate um

ethical Norms because this old school so

so so in the olden days what you could

do is obviously we were confronted with

something you you could you could tap on

it right and if you heard a metallic

clanging sound you'd said ah fine right

so you could conclude it was made in a

factory I could take it apart I can do

whatever right if you did that and you

got you know sort of a squishy uh kind

of warm sensation you'd say I need to be

you know more or less nice to it and

whatever that's not going to be feasible

it was never really feasible but it was

good enough because we didn't have any

we didn't know any better that needs to

go and I think that

uh by by breaking down those artificial

barriers someday we can try to build a a

system of of ethical Norms that does not

rely on these completely contingent

facts of of our Earthly history but on

something much much deeper that you know

really um takes takes agency and and the

capacity to suffer and all that takes

that seriously

the capacity to suffer and the Deep

questions I would ask of a system is can

I eat it and can I have sex with it

um which is the the two fundamental

tests of Again The Human Condition

uh so I can basically do what Dali does

that's in the in in the physical space

so print out like a 3D print a Pepe the

frog with a propeller head

propeller hat

uh is the is the Dream well yes and no I

mean I want to get away from the 3D

printing thing because that will be

available for some things much earlier I

mean we can already do bladders and ears

and things like that because it's micro

level control right when you 3D print

you are in charge of where every cell

goes and for some things that you know

for for like this thing they had that I

think 20 years ago or maybe a little

earlier than that you could do that so

yeah I would like to have says the dolly

part where you provide a few words yeah

and it generates a painting so here you

say I want a frog

with these features and then it would go

direct a complex biological system to

construct something like that yeah the

main magic would be I mean I think from

from looking at Dali and so on it looks

like the first part is kind of solved

now where you go from from the words to

the image like that seems more or less

solved the next step is really hard this

is what keeps things like crispr and

genomic editing and so on it's good this

is what limits all the except

uh uh impacts for for gender medicine

because going back to okay this is the

knee joint that I want or this is the

eye that I want

now what genes do I edit to make that

happen right going back in that

direction is really hard so instead of

that it's going to be okay I understand

how to motivate cells to build

particular structures can I rewrite the

memory of what they think they're

supposed to be building such that then I

can you know take my hands off the wheel

and let them let them do their thing so

some of that is experiment but some of

that maybe AI can help too just like

with protein folding this is exactly the

problem that protein folding uh in in

the most simple

medium tried and has solved with Alpha

fold which is how does the sequence of

letters result in this three-dimensional

shape and you have to

um I guess it didn't solve it because

you have to

if you say I want this shape how do I

then have a sequence of letters

yeah the reverse engineering stuff is

really tricky it is I think I think

where where and we're doing some of this

now is is to uh use AI to try and uh

build actionable models of the

intelligence of the cellular collectives

so try to help us to help us gain models

that that

um and and we've had some success in

this so we did something like this for

um uh for you know for repairing uh

birth defects of the brain in frog we've

done some of this for um normalizing

melanoma uh where you can really start

to use AI to make models of how would I

impact this thing if I wanted to given

all the complexities right and and given

all the uh the the the controls that

that it knows how to do so when you say

Regenerative medicine
regenerative medicine so we talked about

creating biological organisms but if you

regrow a hand that information is

already there

right the biological system has that

information

so how does regenerative medicine work

today how do you hope it works what's

the hope there yeah yeah how do you make

it happen well today there's a set of

popular approaches so so one is 3D

printing so the idea is I'm going to

make a scaffold of the thing that I want

I'm going to seed it with cells and then

and then there it is right so kind of

direct and then that works for certain

things you can make a bladder that way

or an ear or something like that

um the other the other ideas is some

sort of stem cell transplant into the

ideas if we uh if we put in stem cells

with appropriate factors we can get them

to generate certain kinds of neurons for

certain you know diseases and so on all

of those things are good for relatively

simple structures but when you want an

eye or a hand or something else I think

in this maybe an unpopular opinion I

think the only hope we have in any

reasonable kind of time frame is to

understand how the thing was motivated

to get made in the first place so what

is it that that made those cells in the

in the beginning create a particular arm

with a particular uh set of sizes and

shapes and number of fingers and all

that and why is it that a salamander can

keep losing theirs and keep regrowing

theirs and a planarian can do the same

even more so to me a kind of ultimate

regenerative medicine was when you can

tell the cells to build whatever it is

you need them to build right and so so

that we can all be like planarian

basically do you have to start at the

very beginning or can you um

do a shortcut okay throwing a hand

you already got the whole organism yeah

so here's what we've done right so so

we've we've more or less solved that in

frog so frogs unlike salamanders do not

regenerate their legs as adults and so

so uh We've shown that with a very um uh

kind of simple intervention so what we

do is there's two things you need to uh

you need to have a signal that tells the

cells what to do and then you need some

way of delivering it and so this is work

together with them with David Kaplan and

I should do a disclosure here we have a

company called morpheuticals and

spin-off where we're trying to uh to

address uh regenerate you know limb

regeneration so we've solved it in the

Frog and we're now in trials and mice so

now we're going we're in mammals now and

I can't say anything about how it's

going but the Frog thing is solved so

what you do is um after you have a

little frog Luke Skywalker with every

growing hand yeah basically basically

yeah yeah so what you do is we did it

with legs instead of forearms and what

you do is after amputation normally they

they don't regenerate you put on a

wearable bioreactor so it's this thing

that um that goes on and Dave kaplan's

lab makes these things and inside it's a

it's a very controlled environment it is

a silk gel that carries uh some drugs

for example ION channel drugs and what

you're doing is you're saying to these

cells

you should regrow what normally goes

here so uh that whole thing is on for 24

hours then you take it off you don't

touch the leg again this is really

important because what we're not looking

for is a set of micromanagement you know

printing or controlling the cells we

want to trigger we want to we want to

interact with it early on and then not

touch it again because because we don't

know how to make a frog leg but the Frog

knows how to make a frog leg so 24 hours

18 months of leg growth after that

without us touching it again and after

18 months you get a pretty good leg that

kind of shows this proof of concept that

early on when the cells right after

injury when they're first making a

decision about what they're going to do

you can you can impact them and once

they've decided to make a leg they don't

need you after that they can you know do

their own thing so that's an approach

that we're now taking what about cancer

Cancer suppression
suppression that's something you

mentioned earlier how can all of these

ideas help with cancer suppression so

let's let's go back to the beginning and

ask what what what what cancer is so I

think um you know asking why there's

cancer is the wrong question I think the

right question is why is there ever

anything but cancer so so in the normal

State you have a bunch of cells that are

all cooperating towards a large-scale

goal if that process of cooperation

breaks down and you've got a cell that

is isolated from that electrical Network

that lets you remember what the big goal

is you revert back to your unicellular

lifestyle as far as now think about that

border between self and world right

normally when all these cells are

connected by gab Junctions into an

electrical Network they are all one self

right meaning that um their goals they

have these large tissue level goals and

so on as soon as the cell is

disconnected from that the self is Tiny

right and so at that point and so so

people a lot of people model cancer cell

cells as being more selfish and all that

they're not more selfish they're equally

selfish it's just that their self is

smaller normally the self is huge now

they got tiny little selves now what are

the goals of tiny little selves well

proliferate right and migrate to

wherever life is good and that's

metastasis so that's proliferation of

metastasis so so one thing we found and

people have noticed years ago that when

cells convert to cancer the first thing

they see is they close the gap Junctions

and it's a lot like I think it's a lot

like that experiment with the slime mold

where until you close that Gap Junction

you can't even entertain the idea of

leaving the collective because there is

no you at that point right your mind

melded with this with this whole other

network but as soon as the Gap Junction

is closed now the boundary between you

now now the rest of the body is just

outside environment to you you're just a

you're just a unicellular organism on

the rest of the body's environment so so

we so we study this process and we

worked out a way to artificially control

troll the bioelectric state of these

cells to physically force them to remain

in that Network and so then then what

that what that means is that nasty

mutations like k-ras and things like

that these are these really tough

oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if

you if you do them and then but but then

but then artificially um uh control of

the bioelectrics you you you greatly

reduce tumor Genesis or or normalized

cells that had already begun to convert

to basically they go back to being

normal cells and so this is another much

like with the planaria this is another

way in which the bioelectric state uh

kind of uh dominates what the what the

genetic state is so if you sequence the

the you know if you sequence the nucleic

acids you'll see the k-aras mutation

you'll say ah well that's going to be a

tumor but there isn't a tumor because

because biologically you've kept the

cells connected and they're just working

on making nice skin and kidneys and

whatever else so so we've started moving

that to um to to human glioblastoma

cells and we're hoping for um you know a

patient in the future um interaction

with patients foreign

possible ways in which we may quote uh

cure cancer I think so yeah I think so I

think I think the actual cure I mean

there are other technology you know

immune therapy I think it's a great um

technology

um chemotherapy I don't think is a good

is a good technology I think we got to

get out get off of that so chemotherapy

just kills cells yeah well chemotherapy

uh hopes to kill more of the tumor cells

than of your cells that's it it's a fine

balance the the problem is the cells are

very similar because they are yourselves

and so if you don't have a very tight

way of distinguishing between them then

uh the toll that chemo takes on the rest

of the body is just unbelievable so an

immunotherapy tries to get the immune

system to do some of the work exactly

yeah I think that's potentially a very

good uh very good approach

um if if the immune system can be taught

to recognize uh enough of of the cancer

cells that's a pretty good approach but

I but I think but I think our approach

is in a way more fundamental because if

you can if you can keep the cells

harnessed toward words organ level goals

as opposed to individual cell goals then

nobody will be making a tumor or

metastasizing and so on

Viruses
so we've been living through a pandemic

what do you think about viruses in this

full beautiful biological context we've

been talking about are they beautiful to

you are they terrifying

also maybe let's say are they

since we've been discriminating this

whole conversation are they living

are they embodied Minds

embodied Minds that are assholes

as far as I know and I haven't been able

to find this paper again but but

somewhere I saw in the last couple of

months there was some there was some

papers showing an example of a virus

that actually had physiology so there

was some something was going on I think

proton flux or something on the virus

itself but but barring that uh generally

speaking viruses are very passive they

don't do anything by themselves and so I

don't see any particular reason to

attribute much of a mind to them I think

um you know uh they represent a way to

hijack other Minds for sure like like

cells and and other things but that's an

interesting interplay though if they're

hijacking other Minds

you know the way we're we were talking

about living organisms that they can

interact with each other and have it uh

alter each other's trajectory

by having interacted I mean there that's

that's a deep

meaningful connection between a virus

and a cell

and I think both are transformed by the

experience and so in that sense both are

living

yeah yeah you know the whole category

that I um

I don't this question of what's living

and what's not living I I really am I'm

not sure I and I know there's people

that work on this and I want to I don't

want to piss anybody off but but

um I have not found that particularly

useful as as to try and make that a

binary um kind of uh distinction I think

level of cognition is very interesting

but as a Continuum but but living a

non-living at you know I don't I really

know what to do with that I don't I

don't know what you do next after after

making that distinction that's why I

make the very binary distinction can I

have sex with it or not can I eat it or

not those because those are actionable

right yeah well I think that's a

critical point that you brought up

because how you relate to something is

really what this is all about right as

an engineer how do I control it but

maybe I shouldn't be controlling it

maybe I should be you know uh can I have

a relationship with it should I be

listening to its advice like like all

the way from you know I need to take it

apart all the way to uh I better do what

it says because it seems to be pretty

smart and everything in between right

that's really what we're asking about

yeah we need to understand our

relationship to it we're searching for

that relationship even in the most

trivial senses

you came up with a lot of interesting

terms

we've mentioned some of them uh agential

material that's a really interesting one

that's a really interesting one for the

future of computation and artificial

intelligence and computer science and

all that

there's also let me go through some of

them if they spark some interesting

thought for you there's teleophobia the

unwarranted fear of airing on the side

of too much agency when considering a

new system

yeah I mean that's the opposite I mean

being afraid of

maybe anthropomorphizing the thing this

will get some people um ticked off I

think but but I I don't think I I think

I think the whole notion of

anthropomorphizing is a holdover from an

A from a pre-scientific uh age where

humans were magic and everything else

wasn't magic and you were

anthropomorphizing when you dared

suggest that uh something else has some

features of humans and I think we need

to be Way Beyond that and this this

issue of anthropomorphizing I think is

um it's a cheap it's a cheap charge I

don't think it it holds any water at all

other than when somebody makes a

cognitive claim I I think all cognitive

claims are engineering claims really so

when somebody says this thing knows or

this thing hopes or this thing wants or

this thing predicts all you can say is

fabulous give me uh the engineering

protocol that you've derived using that

hypothesis and we will see if this thing

helps us or not and then and then we can

you know then we can make a rational

decision I also like Anatomy compiler a

future system representing the long-term

end game of the science of morphogenesis

that reminds us how far away from True

understanding we are someday you will be

able to sit in front of an anatomical

computer specify the shape of the animal

or a plant that you want and it will

convert that shape specification to a

set of stimuli that will have to be

given to cells to build exactly that

shape no matter how weird

it ends up being you have total control

just imagine the possibility for memes

in the physical space one of the

Glorious accomplishments of human

civilizations is memes in digital space

now this could create memes in in

physical space I am both excited and

terrified by that possibility uh

Cognitive light cones
cognitive light cone I think we also

talked about the outer boundary in space

and time of the largest gold a given

system can work towards

is this kind of like shaping the set of

options it's a little different than

options it's it's really focused on so

so so back in uh this this I I first

came up with this back in 2018 I want to

say we had a there was a conference um a

Templeton a conference where they

challenged us to come up with Frameworks

I think actually it's the here it's the

diverse intelligence uh community that

summer Institute yeah they had a summer

Institute but um the logos the B with

some circuits yeah it's got different

different life forms and you know so so

so the whole the whole uh program is

called diverse intelligence and they

sort they challenge you to stick them up

with a framework that was suitable for

analyzing different kinds of

intelligence together right because

because the kinds of things you do to a

human who are not good with an octopus

not good with a plant and so on so so I

started thinking about this and

um I I asked myself what uh what do all

cognitive agents no matter what their

Providence no matter what their um uh uh

architecture is what what what do

cognitive agents have in common and it

seems to me that what they have in

common is some degree of Competency to

pursue a goal and so what you can do

then is you can draw and so what I what

I what I ended up drawing was this thing

that it's kind of like a like a

backwards um minkowski cone diagram

where all of space is could collapsed

into one axis and then and then here and

then time is is this axis and then what

you can do is you can draw for any

creature you can you can

semi-quantitatively estimate what are

the what are the spatial and temporal

goals that it can that it's capable of

pursuing so for example if you are a

tick and all you can uh all you really

are able to pursue is Maxima or

bacterium in the maximizing the level of

some some chemical in your vicinity

right that's all you've got it's a tiny

little icon then then you're a simple

system like a tick or a bacterium if you

are something like a dog well you've got

some ability to um uh to care about some

some spatial region some temporal you

know you can you can remember a little

bit backwards you can you can predict a

little bit forwards but you're never

ever going to care about what happens in

the next town over four weeks from now

it just it's just as far as We Know It's

Just impossible for that kind of

architecture if you're a human you might

be working towards World Peace long

after you're dead right so you might

have a a planetary scale goal that's

that's enormous right and and so and and

then there may be there may be other

greater intelligence is somewhere that

can care in the linear range about

numbers of creatures that you know some

sort of buddha-like character that can

like care about everybody's welfare like

really care the way that we can't

um and so and so that it it's it's not a

it's not a mapping of what you can sense

how far you can sense right it's not a

mapping of where how far you can act

it's a mapping of how big are the goals

you are capable of envisioning and

working towards and I think that enables

you to put

um the

synthetic kinds of constructs AIS aliens

um swarms whatever on the same diagram

because because we're not talking about

What You're Made Of or how you got here

we're talking about what are the what

are the the the the size and complexity

of the gold storage which you can work

is there any other terms that pop into

mind that are interesting

I'm trying to remember this is a I have

a list of them somewhere on my way

Target morphology yeah people yeah

definitely check it out more more

suitable I like that one ionoseutical

yeah yeah I mean those those those refer

to different types of interventions in

the regenerative medicine space so

amorphosutical is something that uh it's

a kind of uh intervention that really

targets the cells

decision making process about what

they're going to build and ionaceuticals

are like that but more focused

specifically on the bioelectrics I mean

there's also of course biochemical

biomechanical who knows what else you

know maybe Optical um kinds of signaling

systems there as well Target morphology

is is interesting it really uh it's

designed to capture this idea that it's

not just feed forward emergence and

oftentimes in biology I mean of course

that happens too but but in many cases

in biology the system is specifically

working towards a Target in anatomical

amorphous space right it's a it's a

navigation task really these kind of

problem solving can be um uh uh ski you

know uh formalized as navigation tasks

and that they're really going towards a

particular region how do you know

because you deviate them and then they

go back

Advice for young people
let me ask you because you've

really challenged a lot of ideas in

biology in in the work you do probably

because uh some of your rebelliousness

comes from the fact that you came from a

different field of Computer Engineering

but could you give advice to young

people today in high school or college

they're trying to pave

their life story whether it's in science

or elsewhere how they can have a career

they can be proud of or a life they can

be proud of advice boy it's dangerous to

give advice because things change so

fast but uh one Central thing I can say

moving up and and through Academia and

whatnot you will be surrounded by really

smart people and what you need to do is

be very careful at distinguishing

specific

critique versus kind of Meta Meta advice

and what I mean by that is

if if somebody really smart and

successful and obviously uh competent is

giving you specific

um critiques on what you've done it

that's gold that's an opportunity to

hone your craft to get better at what

you're doing to learn to find your

mistakes like that's great

if they are telling you what you ought

to be studying how you ought to approach

things what is the right way to think

about things

you should probably ignore most of that

and the reason I make that distinction

is that a lot of really

um a really successful uh people are

very well calibrated on their own ideas

and they on in their own field and their

own you know sort of uh area and they

know exactly what works and what doesn't

and what's good and what's bad but

they're not calibrated on your ideas and

so so uh the things they will they will

say oh you know this is a dumb idea

don't do this and you shouldn't do that

that stuff is generally uh worse than

worse than useless it can be very very

um uh demoralizing and and and and

really limiting and so so what I say to

people is read very broadly work really

hard know what you're talking about take

all specific criticism as a

um as an opportunity to improve what

you're doing and then completely ignore

everything else because I I just tell

you from like from from my own

experience um most of what I consider to

be interesting and useful things that

we've done very smart people have said

this is a terrible idea don't don't

don't do that don't you know just um

yeah I think I think we we just don't

know we have no idea beyond beyond our

own like at best we know what we ought

to be doing we very rarely know what

anybody else should be doing yeah and

their ideas

their perspective has been also

calibrated not just on their field and

specific situation but also on a state

of that field at a particular time in

the past so there's not many people in

this world that are able to achieve

revolutionary success multiple times in

their life so whenever you say somebody

very smart usually what that means is

somebody who's smart who achieved the

success at certain point in their life

and people often get stuck in that place

where they found success to be

constantly challenging your world view

is a very difficult thing

um so yeah and that also at the same

time probably if a lot of people tell

that's the weird thing about life if a

lot of people tell you

that something is stupid or is not going

to work

that either means it's stupid it's not

going to work or

it's actually a great opportunity to do

something new

and you don't know which one it is it's

probably equally likely to be either if

no well I don't know the probabilities

depends how lucky you are it depends how

brilliant you are but you don't know and

so you can't take that advice as actual

data yeah you have to um you have to and

this is this is kind of hard and fuzzy

like hard to describe and fuzzy but I

I'm uh a firm believer that you have to

uh build up your own intuition so over

time right you have to take your own

risks that seem like they make sense to

you and then learn from that and build

up so that you can trust your own gut

about what's a good idea even when and

then sometimes you'll make mistakes and

they'll turn out to be a dead end and

that's fine that's that's science but

but um you know what I tell my students

is is uh life is hard and science is is

hard and you're going to sweat and bleed

and everything and you should be doing

that for uh ideas that that really fire

you up inside and and um you know and

and really don't let uh kind of the uh

the the common denominator of

standardized approaches to things slow

you down

Death
so you mentioned planaria being in some

sense Immortal what's the role of death

in life

what's the role of death in this whole

process we have is is it uh when you

look at biological systems

is death an important feature

especially as you climb up the hierarchy

of uh competency boy that's an

interesting question

um I think that uh it's certainly a

factor that promotes change and turnover

and an opportunity to do something

different the next time

for a larger scale system so apoptosis

you know it's really interesting I mean

death is really interesting in a number

of ways one is like you could think

about like what was the first thing to

die you know that's that's an

interesting question what was the first

creature that you could say actually die

it's a tough it's a tough thing because

we don't have a great definition for it

so if you bring a a cabbage home and you

put it in your fridge

at what point are you gonna say it's

died you're right then so so that's it's

kind of hard

um to know there's also there's also uh

the the there's there's one paper in

which I talk about this idea that I mean

think about think about this and and

imagine that uh you have you have a

creature uh that's aquatic let's say

let's say it's a it's a frog or

something or a tadpole and the animal

dies in the in the pond it dies for

whatever reason

most of the cells are still alive so you

could imagine that if when it died there

was some sort of um breakdown of of of

of the of the connectivity between the

cells a bunch of cells crawled off they

could have a life as amoebas they some

of them could join together and become a

zenabot and toodle around right so we

know from planaria that there are cells

that don't obey the hayflick limit and

just sort of live live forever so you

could imagine an organism that when the

organism dies it doesn't disappear

rather the individual cells that are

still alive crawl off and have a

completely different kind of lifestyle

and maybe come back together as

something else or maybe they don't so so

all of this I'm sure is happening

somewhere on some on some on some Planet

so so

um death in any case I mean we already

kind of knew this because the molecules

we you know we know with something nice

the molecules go through the ecosystem

but even the cells don't necessarily die

at that point they might have another

life in a different uh in a different

way you can think about something like

Gila right The Gila cell line you know

that has this that's had this incredible

life uh there are way more Hela cells

now than there ever been than there than

there were when when she was alive it

seems like as the organisms become more

and more complex like if you look at the

mammals their relationship with death

becomes more and more complex

so the survival imperative starts

becoming interesting and humans

are arguably the first species

that have invented the fear of death the

understanding that you're going to die

let's put it this way like a long-term

so not like ins instinctual like I need

to run away from the thing that's going

to eat me but starting to contemplate

the finiteness of Life yeah I mean one

thing so one thing about the human light

cognitive light cone is that for the

first as far as we know for the first

time you might have goals that are

longer than your life that are not

achievable right so if you're if you're

let's say and I I don't know if this is

true but if if you're of goldfish and

you have a 10 minute attention span I'm

not sure if that's true but let's say

let's say there's some organism with a

with a short um you know kind of

cognitive light cone that way

all of your goals are potentially

achievable because you're probably going

to live the next 10 minutes so whatever

goals you have they are totally

achievable if you're a human you could

have all kinds of goals that are

guaranteed not achievable because they

just take too long like guaranteed

you're not going to achieve them so I

wonder if you know is that is that a per

you know like a perennial um you know

sort of thorn in our in our psychology

that drives some some psychosis or

whatever I have no idea another

interesting thing about that actually

I've been thinking about this a lot in

the last couple of weeks this notion of

giving up so you would think that

evolutionarily the most um adaptive way

of being is that you go you you you

fight as long as you physically can and

then when you can't you can't and

there's in there's this Photograph

there's some videos you can find of

insects crawling around where like you

know this like like most of it is

already gone and it's still sort of

crawling you know like

um um a Terminator style right like as

far as as long as you physically can you

keep going

mammals don't do that so so a lot of

mammals including rats have this thing

where when when they think it's it's a

hopeless situation they literally give

up and die when physically they could

have kept going I mean humans certainly

do this and there's there's some like

really unpleasant experiments that the

the this guy forget his name did with

them drowning rats where if he where

where rats normally drown after a couple

of minutes but if you teach them that if

you just tread water for a couple of

minutes you'll get rescued they can

tread water for like an hour and so

right and so they literally just give up

and die and so evolutionarily that

doesn't seem like a good strategy at all

evolutionarily since why would you like

what's the benefit ever of giving up you

just do what you can and you know one

time out of a thousand you'll actually

get rescued right but this issue of of

of actually giving up suggests some very

interesting metacognitive controls where

you've now gotten to the point where

survival actually isn't the top drive

and that for whatever you know there are

other considerations that have like

taken over and I I think that's uniquely

a mammalian thing but um I don't know

yeah the Camus

the existentialist question of Why Live

just the fact that humans commit suicide

is a really fascinating question from an

evolutionary perspective and what was

the first and that's the other thing

like what is the simplest uh system

whether whether evolved or you know

natural or whatever that is able to do

that right like you can think you know

what other animals are actually able to

do that I'm not sure maybe

you could see animals over time for some

reason lowering the value of survive at

all costs gradually until other

objectives might become more important

maybe I don't know how evolutionarily

how that how that gets off the ground

that just seems like that would have

such a strong pressure against it you

know

just imagine a you know a population

with with with a lower

um you know what what if if you were a

mutant in a population that had less of

a uh less of a survival imperative would

you would your genes outperform the

others it seems no is there such a thing

as population selection because maybe

suicide is a way

uh for organisms to decide that

themselves that they're not

fit for the environment somehow yeah

that's a that's a really uh country you

know population level selection is a is

a kind of a deep controversial area but

it's tough because on the face of it if

that was your genome it wouldn't get

propagated because you would die and

then your neighbor who didn't have that

would have all the kids it feels like

there could be some deep truth there

that we're not understanding

um what about you yourself as one

biological system are you afraid of

death

to be honest I'm more concerned with uh

especially now getting older and having

helped a couple of people pass I think

about what's a um

what's a good way to go basically like

nowadays I don't know what that is I you

know sitting in a you know a facility

that sort of tries to uh stretch you out

as as long as you can that doesn't seem

that doesn't seem good and there's not a

lot of opportunities to sort of

um I don't know sacrifice yourself for

something useful right there's not

terribly many opportunities for that in

modern society so I don't know that's

that's that's more of I'm not I'm not

particularly worried about uh death

itself but uh I've I've seen it happen

uh and and it's not it's not pretty and

I don't know what what a better what a

better alternative is so the existential

aspect of it does not

worry you deeply the fact that this ride

ends

no it began I mean the ride began right

so there was I don't know how many

billions of years before that I wasn't

around so that's okay but isn't the

experience of life

it's almost like feels like you're

Immortal because the way you make plans

the way you think about the future I

mean if if you re if you look at your

own personal Rich experience

yes you can understand okay eventually I

died there's people I love that have

died so surely I will die and it hurts

and so on but like it sure doesn't it's

so easy to get lost and feeling like

this is going to go on forever yeah it's

a little bit like the people who say

they don't believe in Free Will right I

mean you can say that but but when you

go to a restaurant you still have to

pick a soup and stuff so right so so I

don't know if I know I've I've actually

seen that that happen at lunch with a

with a well-known philosopher and uh he

wouldn't believe in Free Will and you

know the waitress came around and he was

like well let me see I was like what are

you doing you're gonna choose a sandwich

right so um it's I think it's one of

those things I think you you can know

that you know you're not going to live

forever but you can't you can't it's not

practical to live that way unless you

know so you buy insurance and then you

do some stuff like that but but but

mostly you know

um I think you just you just live as if

uh as if as if you can make plans

fuck

Meaning of life
we talked about all kinds of life we

talked about all kinds of embodied Minds

what do you think is the meaning of it

all

what's the meaning

of all the biological eyes I've been

talking about here on Earth why are we

here

I don't know that that's a that that's a

well-posed question other than the

existential question you posed before is

that question hanging out with the

question of what is consciousness and

their uh Edward Retreat somewhere not

sure because sipping pina coladas and

because they're Ambiguously defined

maybe I'm I'm not sure that any of these

things really ride on the the

correctness of our scientific

understanding but I mean just just for

an example right

um I've I've always found I've always

found it weird that uh people get really

worked up uh to find out realities about

their their bodies for for example right

you've seen them uh ex machina right and

so so there's this great scene where

he's cutting his hand to find out he's

you know he's full of cock now to me

right if if I open up and I find out and

I find a bunch of cogs my conclusion is

not oh crap I must not have true

cognition that sucks my conclusion is

wow cogs can have true cognition great

so right so so it seems to me I guess I

guess I'm with Descartes on this one

then whatever whatever the truth uh ends

up being of of how is what is

consciousness how it can be conscious

none of that is going to alter my

primary experience which is this is what

it is and if and if a bunch of molecular

networks can do it fantastic if it turns

out that um there's a there's a

non-corporeal you know Soul uh great we

could you know we'll study that whatever

but but the fundamental

um existential aspect of it is you know

if somebody if somebody told me uh today

that uh yeah yeah you were created

yesterday and all your memories are you

know sort of uh fake you know kind of

like um like like boltzmann brains right

and the human you know human skepticism

and all that uh yeah okay well so so but

but here I am now so so let's experience

is Primal so it like that's the that's

the thing that matters so the the back

story doesn't matter the explanation I

think so from a first person per second

now from a third person like

scientifically it's all very interesting

from a third person perspective I could

say wow that's that's amazing that that

this happens and how does it happen or

whatever but from a first person

perspective I could care less like I

just it's just what I've what I learned

from any of these scientific facts is

okay well I guess then that's that then

I guess that's what is sufficient to to

give me my uh you know amazing first

person perspective well I think if you

dig deeper and deeper and get a

get surprising answers to why the hell

we're here

it might give you some guidance on how

to live

maybe maybe I don't know um that would

be nice on the one hand you might be

right because on the one hand if I don't

know what else could possibly give you

that guidance right so so you would

think that it would have to be that or

it would it would have to be science

because there isn't anything else so so

that's so maybe on the other hand

I am really not sure how you go from any

you know what they call from an is to an

ought right from any factual description

of what's going on this this goes back

to the natural right just because

somebody says oh man that's completely

not natural it's never happened on Earth

before I I'm not you know impressed by

that whatsoever I think I think whatever

has or hasn't happened we are now in a

position to do better if we can right

well there's also good because you said

there's science and there's nothing else

there it's it's really tricky

to know

how to intellectually deal with the

thing that science doesn't currently

understand

right so like

the thing is if you believe that science

solves everything

you can too easily in your mind think

our current understanding like we've

solved everything right right right like

it jumps really quickly to not science

as a mechanism as a as a process

but more like the size of today like you

could just look at human history and

throughout human history just physicists

and everybody would claim we've solved

everything sure sure like there's a few

small things to figure out and just we

basically solved everything uh where in

reality I think asking like what is the

meaning of life

is uh resetting the palette

yeah of like

we might be tiny and confused and don't

have anything figured out it's almost

going to be hilarious a few centuries

from now when they look back how dumb we

were yeah 100 agree so so when I say uh

science and nothing else I certainly

don't mean the science of today because

I think overall I think we are we know

very little I think most of the things

that we're sure of now are going to be

as you said are going to look hilarious

down the line

um so I think we're just at the

beginning of a lot of really important

things

when I say nothing but science I also

include the kind of first person what I

call science that you do so the

interesting thing about um I think about

Consciousness and studying Consciousness

and things like that in the first person

is unlike doing science in the third

person where you as the scientists are

minimally Changed by it maybe not at all

so when I do an experiment I'm still me

there's the experiment whatever I've

done I've learned something so that's a

small change but but overall that's it

in order to really study Consciousness

you will you are part of the experiment

you will be altered by that experiment

right whatever whatever it is that

you're doing whether it's you know some

sort of contemplative practice or

uh or or some sort of uh you know

psychoactive but you know whatever uh

you are now you are now your own

experiment and you are right and so so I

can say I fold that in I think that's

that's part of it I think that exploring

um our own mind and our own

Consciousness is very important I think

much of it is not captured by what

currently is third person science for

sure but ultimately I include all of

that in science

with a capital s in terms of like a um

uh a rational investigation of both

first and third person aspects of our

world

we are our own experiment as beautifully

put and uh when when two systems get to

interact with each other that's the kind

of experiment so I'm deeply honored you

would uh do this experiment with me

today thanks so much I'm a huge fan of

your work likewise thank you for doing

everything you're doing

um I can't wait to see the kind of

incredible things you build so thank you

for talking today really appreciate

being here thank you

thank you for listening to this

conversation with Michael Levin to

let me leave you with some words from

Charles Darwin in the Origin of Species

from the war of nature from famine and

death

the most exalted object which we're

capable of conceiving namely the

production of the higher animals

directly follows

there's Grandeur in this view of life

with its several Powers having been

originally breathed into a few forms or

into one and that whilst this planet has

gone cycling on according to the fixed

laws of gravity from a so simpler

beginning endless forms most beautiful

and most wonderful have been and are

being evolved
