NIST also has a participation agreement with CHORUS, facilitating access to publication metrics for NIST and awardee-authored publications. NIST research data is accessible through links on data.gov and through the NIST data portal. Software produced by NIST for research purposes is inventoried and accessible through our data infrastructure, and open-source code is now also discoverable through a new NIST code portal.

NIST Public Access Plan 
 
The above-linked Public Access Plan, for which the public comment period closed on August 14, 2023 (see Federal Register Notice), will be used to revise the existing NIST Policy for Providing Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research. Information on these webpages has not been updated to reflect changes that may result from implementation of the new plan.

 
NIST is committed to the idea that results of federally funded research are a valuable national resource and a strategic asset.  To the extent feasible and consistent with law, agency mission, resource constraints, and U.S. national, homeland, and economic security, NIST will promote the deposit of scientific data arising from unclassified research and programs, funded wholly or in part by NIST, except for Standard Reference Data, free of charge in publicly accessible databases.  Subject to the same conditions and constraints listed above, NIST also intends to make freely available to the public, in publicly accessible repositories, all peer-reviewed scholarly publications arising from unclassified research and programs funded wholly or in part by NIST. 
 
NIST publications can be located through the NIST website.  Peer-reviewed papers are deposited in PMC.  NIST Technical Series and publications that are not peer reviewed are available through govinfo.  Papers can also be located through science.gov along with other government papers.  NIST data can be located through the Science Data Portal on the NIST website and through data.gov, along with other government data.  Links to repositories containing NIST code, data, and publications are provided to the right.
 
NIST has established an embargo period of no more than 12 months post-publication for making peer-reviewed publications freely available through NIST’s repository on PMC.  Stakeholders may petition NIST’s Open Access Officer to change the embargo period in the following year for publications in a specified scientific field.  A petition must demonstrate that the existing embargo period for certain fields of scientific research does not provide a public benefit and is inconsistent with the objectives articulated in the OSTP Memo.  When considering changes to the embargo period, NIST will consult with other agencies that fund related areas of scientific research.   


Editorial Review of Manuscripts
Share

Scientific and technical manuscripts with NIST authors or coauthors must be reviewed and approved through the Editorial Review Board (ERB) prior to submission to a publisher.  NIST authors are responsible for informing their non-NIST collaborators of this policy. The ERB review is meant to ensure that NIST’s quality management objectives are met:  

Scientific and technical information disseminated by NIST is presented in a clear, complete, and unbiased manner.  

Conclusions are supported by data and observations.  

Figures and tables are correct, clear, useful, necessary, and properly labeled.  

Manuscripts are organized efficiently and appropriately and contain proper syntax, grammar, and spelling.  

Acronyms are used sparingly and defined properly the first time that they are used.  

Results are reliable and accurate within an acceptable degree of uncertainty. 

 

NIST policy requires the following: 

NIST measurement results comprise a measured value and an evaluation of measurement uncertainty; see NIST Technical Notes 1297 https://www.nist.gov/pml/nist-technical-note-1297  or 1900 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/TechnicalNotes/NIST.TN.1900.pdf. 

NIST measurement results must be reported using the International System of Units (SI) and SI style; see NIST Special Publication 811 https://www.nist.gov/publications/guide-use-international-system-units-si.  

NIST does not evaluate commercial products unless such an evaluation is part of a formal agreement. NIST does not endorse commercial products or services. The use of trade and product names should be avoided; generic terminology should be used wherever possible. A disclaimer must be included if a commercial product must be mentioned. 

 

The Review Process 

NIST’s editorial review process is handled through the NIST Publications System. The system allows authors, managers, and other reviewers to easily determine who a manuscript’s reviewers are and where it is in the review process.  Papers are typically read by five people who have different primary responsibilities in the review, covering technical and editorial quality as well as policy requirements: the Group Leader, two technical reviewers, the Division Chief, and an Editorial Review Board member (called an ‘ERB Sponsor’). The ERB Chair does a quick final check before approving the paper for release. The system is accessible within the NIST firewall, although it is possible for external reviewers to access it to conduct their reviews. 

If you are an external co-author on a paper with NIST staff and have questions about the status of a review, please contact your fellow NIST author.

NIST Directives related to public access
Policy:  NIST P 5700.00 Managing Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research
Order:  NIST O 5701.00 Managing Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research
Guidance:  NIST G 5701.00 Guidance for Review of Data Management Plans Submitted with Applications and Proposals for NIST Funding for Scientific Research
Order:  NIST O 5702.00 Preservation and Maintenance of Published Research Data
Procedure:  NIST PR 5702.01 Managing Public Access to External Research Funded by NIST
Guidance:  NIST G5702.01 Guidance for Making Non-NIST Data Available Through NIST's Data Management Infrastructure

 

NIST's Public Access Plan
The original NIST Plan for Providing Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research published in 2015 was replaced by the directives above.  The Plan and comments that were received in response to the Federal Register Notice announcing its availability for public comment, Docket Number 150414364-5364-01 are provided in NISTIR 8084. A revised plan was published in 2023 along with public comments; directives have not yet been updated to reflect the new plan. NIST continues to operate under the directives linked above.

NIST Professional Research Experience Program (PREP)

NIST’s Professional Research and Experience Program (PREP) provides valuable laboratory experience and financial assistance to researchers at various stages of their studies and careers. This official collaboration between participating universities and NIST aims to provide research opportunities to students and graduates. 

Researchers from various academic departments apply for PREP appointments. In return, NIST researchers have access to students, recent grads, postdocs, senior researchers, and faculty who bring new ideas and experiences that can strengthen the agency’s research programs. 

Upcoming deadlines:
Check with participating colleges and universities for upcoming PREP deadlines. 

The purpose of this program is to:

Develop and train a diverse, world-class pool of scientists and engineers to support NIST's mission in measurement science and standards research.
Increase the recruitment, retention and graduation rates of undergraduate and graduate students pursuing STEM degrees.
Recruit and retain historically marginalized groups (women, minorities, and persons with disabilities) in STEM.
Assure continued growth and progress of a highly skilled STEM workforce in the U.S.
Colleges and Universities 
If your accredited institution offers a two-year or four-year degree in academic science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, you can apply to establish and manage a research relationship with NIST labs in Boulder, Colorado, Gaithersburg, Maryland, or Charleston, South Carolina. PREP is a five-year cooperative agreement. Calls for application to the next award will be posted in March 2027.

See our Notice of Funding Opportunity for more information.
