The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory agency within the United States Department of Commerce, dedicated to promoting American innovation and industrial competitiveness. Founded in 1901 as the National Bureau of Standards, NIST was renamed in 1988 and has since become one of the nation's oldest and most respected physical science laboratories.

NIST's primary mission is to advance measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life. The institute focuses on key areas including measurement science, standards development, technology advancement, industrial competitiveness, cybersecurity, privacy, and physical science research.

Organizationally, NIST operates from its headquarters in Gaithersburg, Maryland, with an additional facility in Boulder, Colorado. Its structure comprises six laboratory programs: Communications Technology, Engineering, Information Technology, Center for Neutron Research, Material Measurement, and Physical Measurement. NIST also manages several extramural programs, including the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Technology Innovation Program, and the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program.

NIST's work encompasses a wide range of initiatives and publications, including the Cybersecurity Framework, Privacy Framework, Special Publications, Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), and NIST Internal/Interagency Reports (NISTIRs). The institute plays a crucial role in international metrology, having contributed to the establishment of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.

In terms of research data management, NIST has implemented systems like MIDAS (for data management plans, enterprise data inventory, and open-source code inventory) and the Public Data Repository (PDR) for secure data storage and public access. These systems support NIST's commitment to providing public access to federally funded research results, as outlined in their 2014 plan.

NIST's Grants Management Division aims to excel in awarding and administering federal financial assistance awards. They provide various resources for grant applicants and recipients, including guidance on application processes and reporting requirements.

Key areas of NIST's work include measurement, standards, technology, innovation, competitiveness, cybersecurity, privacy, physical sciences, metrology, and industrial advancement. Through its diverse programs and initiatives, NIST continues to play a vital role in advancing scientific research, technological innovation, and industrial competitiveness in the United States.
