        # Future of Life Institute (FLI) Overview

The Future of Life Institute (FLI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to steering transformative technologies towards benefiting life and mitigating extreme large-scale risks. Founded in 2014, FLI operates in an unprecedented era where human actions can significantly impact all life on Earth, and where intelligence, rather than evolution, is poised to engineer life's future.

FLI's multifaceted approach encompasses six key initiatives: policy development and advocacy, outreach and education, research support, grantmaking for under-resourced fields, institution-building for governance, and coordinating global action. The organization primarily focuses on advanced AI, militarized AI, and nuclear war, with secondary attention to pro-social platforms, climate change, and bio-risks.

Guided by principles of impact-driven action, urgency, forward-thinking, scientific reasoning, and inclusivity, FLI concentrates its efforts on three primary cause areas: Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, and Nuclear Weapons. The institute's structure includes a global staff of over 20, a board of directors, and external advisors.

FLI has achieved significant milestones in its mission, including organizing the first AI safety conferences, establishing an AI safety grants program in 2015, and developing the Asilomar AI Principles in 2017. The institute has also produced impactful media such as the "Slaughterbots" films and the "Imagine A World" podcast. FLI's influence extends to international policy, serving as a UN civil society co-champion for AI and contributing to AI regulation efforts in Europe.

To engage with the public and disseminate its message, FLI maintains an active online presence through its website (futureoflife.org), YouTube channel, and social media platforms. The institute also distributes a monthly newsletter to over 41,000 subscribers. Committed to transparency, FLI publishes annual reports detailing its activities, funding, and team composition on its website.

Through these diverse efforts, FLI strives to address the profound changes brought about by rapidly advancing technologies, aiming to ensure that these advancements benefit humanity and safeguard the future of life on Earth.
