1. PROGRAM INFORMATION
1.1. Background
The R2
 program seeks to enable the manufacture of critical structures using indigenously available
feedstock materials at the time and point of need (Figure 1), in a contested logistics environment,
and break current production paradigms. Current norms utilize structural systems that have an
optimized design based on an assumed, readily available, supply chain of “exquisite” material. In
this construct, any change in material input or operations outside a tightly controlled factory
requires costly re-design due to an inflexible production and design framework. Larger system level
effects of single components, much less whole scale material changes, are unable to be accounted
for without extensive analysis and testing. As such, flexibility is intentionally designed out, forcing
system convergence to point designs reliant on fixed inputs to produce fixed outputs.
Figure 1: R2
 looks to significantly increase the ability to produce critical items at point of need utilizing scavenged material. The
scope of the DARPA program includes updating the design and fabricating a sounding rocket from variable scavenged feedstocks,
with the potential to apply developed knowledge and technology in other capacities at the point of need.
Design flexibility could be revolutionized by building a framework which can account for system
level effects of materials and components. Existing, as well as future systems, would benefit from
an analytical framework for rapid component and/or system changes to incorporate the growing
number of new material developments and updated fabrication methods (e.g., additive
manufacturing), significantly reducing adoption risk.
R2
 seeks to upend the current limitations of forward production enabling the use of indigenously
available material for demanding structural applications while creating a solution that is both
flexible and deployable, while meeting other point of need manufacturing considerations. For
purposes of this solicitation, mobile and deployable are not synonymous. DARPA seeks to break
the need for monolithic facilities with large, immovable footprints; however, R2
 does not
necessarily seek a TEL-on-demand (Transport, Erect, Launch) type of capability. Solutions should
be deployable in a reasonable capacity, but are not required to be tactically mobile/agile on the
battlespace. Proposers should define the CONOPS (concept of operations) and SWaP (size, weight,
and power) their solution is applicable to and how that fits within existing and future Department
of Defense (DoD) capability gaps. Lower SWaP is desirable, however, proposers should balance
capability to achieve metrics with potential CONOPS.
While existing initiatives for forward structures production are advanced and innovative, they
operate under the assumption that pristine raw materials will be readily available with a fixed 
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
design with a fixed material, eliminating the flexibility required for forward and supply chain
impacted production. Material conversion, the process of substantially changing the geometric
and/or microstructural features (e.g., atomization, wire extrusion, sheet production, etc.) is typically
limited to large foundries in tightly controlled process configurations utilizing pristine materials.
Any structural use of material requires substantial qualification and analysis of both process and
material. Utilization of scavenged processed material is limited to non-structural applications due to
lack of confidence and inability to meet anticipated design requirements. Furthermore, the greater
the unknowns (e.g., unknown steel alloy or age condition) or less pristine (e.g., painted, rusted, mill
surface), the fewer applications for use exist. This drastically limits an ability to utilize scavenged
processed materials at point of need due to an inability to effectively convert and predict properties
to utilize for structural applications. Advances in material conversion and understanding of
contaminant effects may open entirely new spaces for highly available material with a lower risk
supply chain and improved energy footprint.
This Program Solicitation (PS) calls specifically for Abstracts to be submitted by April 05, 2024,
5:00PM ET. Abstracts will be reviewed by the Government; if selected, the proposer will be asked
to provide an Oral Presentation. Oral Presentations will be reviewed by the Government, and if
selected, may result in a Phase 1 award of an Other Transaction and eligibility to participate in
future Phases of the program.
This PS encourages solutions from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government’s
needs, including large and small businesses, nontraditional defense contractors as defined in 10
U.S.C. § 3014, and research institutions as defined in 15 U.S.C. § 638.
1.2. Program Description/Scope
Overall R2
 Program Scope
The R2
 program seeks to take assorted indigenous feedstock materials (starting with pristine
material feedstock), predict the material properties, then adaptively update a 200-350mm diameter
sounding rocket’s structural design with predictive changes in system level performance. To
accomplish this, R2
 aims to create a flexible and deployable manufacturing platform for the
adaptable production and characterization of various raw materials for use in structural fabrication.
R2
 intends to leverage material informatics and innovative processing and manufacturing
techniques in a rapid, iterative design challenge schedule culminating in a subscale pressure test
validation at the end of each primary phase. The objective of R2 is to work with continually more
diverse and unpredictable materials while simultaneously increasing the complexity and
performance of end state structures. It is envisioned that this technology may ultimately consist of
converting pulverized vehicular, structural, and other complex salvaged materials into
manufacturable feedstock.
Competitive proposals will include an integrated system to include novel material conversion
technology, in-line characterization of material properties, and the ability to rapidly iterate on the
development of components by understanding the system-level effects of material
variability/deviations and adapting the final design to meet program metrics. DARPA expects to
select a diverse set of performers across multiple common primary material streams to include
aluminum, steel, plastic, glass, and/or paper. Competitive proposals will also demonstrate a clear
understanding of available, developing, and/or novel material stream-dependent deployable
manufacturing concepts and how that integrates into their overall CONOPS for the R2
 system.
Figure 2 indicates the high-level approach to forward manufacturing envisioned by the R2
 program.

As highlighted, R2
 will focus on the conversion, characterization, and adaptive designing aspects
of the creation cycle. DARPA is not interested in the development of new forward deployable
manufacturing cells for metallic or plastic additive manufacturing, but encourages leveraging
existing developments in this technology area to inform the R2
 specific CONOPS. More
conventional manufacturing, such as machining casting, forging, composite layup, and welding
(among many others), are within scope and proposers are encouraged to utilize readily available
and/or easily implemented manufacturing approaches where appropriate.
Figure 2: The focus of the R2
 program lies in its ability to convert, characterize, and use adaptive design to enable forward
manufacturing of structures in isolated logistics environments.
Convert to enable usable form factors with highest possible material property performance. R2
aims to overcome current limitations in processing diverse, complex, or contaminated indigenous
feedstock by developing tooling and processing approaches that can accommodate widely variable
inputs. Utilizing insights from current material conversion efforts (e.g., friction stir-extrusion of
wire from shredded aluminum) along with advances in tooling design (e.g., additive tooling) and
process control (e.g., closed loop feedback control), conversion systems will transform into material
processing units for readily-available scavenged feedstock. Successful proposers will develop
robust, innovative processing approaches to effectively utilize increasingly diverse (e.g., aluminum,
steel, plastic, glass, paper) and difficult (e.g., clean vs contaminated) scavenged feedstock streams
while maintaining high rate (>0.1 m3
/day) of functional feedstock production.
Proposers should define material streams in which they believe their processing capability is
effective. The description of a materials stream should be based on: material family, base materials,
purity, and material forms per the definitions that follow. Material streams that incorporate multiple
base materials within a given material family; multiple material families are preferred. The
combination of materials streams that a process can utilize is referred to as the “domain of
applicability.” Below may serve as a guide in aiding proposer defined domains of applicability, but
should not be considered exhaustive or prescriptive in all possible domains.
 Material Families: High-level material system being processed. Examples include:
o Metals
o Ceramics
o Plastics
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
o Composites
o Natural (e.g., wood/paper)
 Base Material: Lower-level identification of the primary constituents of the Material
Family. Examples by Material Family include:
o Metals: Primary element – e.g., iron (Fe) (ferrous), aluminum (Al), nickel (Ni),
titanium (Ti)
o Ceramics: Primary compound – e.g., aluminum oxide, yttrium-stabilized zirconia
(YSZ)
o Plastics: Polymer family – e.g., polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate (PC),
polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)
o Composites: Resin & reinforcement combination – e.g., polyethylene (PE)/glass
fiber, epoxy/carbon fiber
o Natural: Primary compound – e.g., cellulose
 Purity: Percentage of the material stream, by mass, that is not associated with the base
material(s)
 Form: Material condition needed as input for processing. Examples include:
o Bulk material – e.g., components, thick sections
o Particulate – e.g., ground or chipped materials
o Wire
o Powder
 Material Stream: Single material family, with a mixture of base material(s), and form(s)
 Domain of Applicability: Combinations of independent or blended material streams
Highly diverse material streams are desired, as well as a path to handling blended material streams
containing multiple material families at varying concentrations to reduce the need for cleaning and
sorting material at point of need. Therefore, proposers should include quantitative, as well as
qualitative, descriptions of the differences between the materials streams handled within the
domain of applicability of the proposed process. Examples of quantitative difference metrics
between material streams might include density, melting point, and/or elastic modulus of the base
materials, as well as characteristic size (length scale) of the forms. Proposers should utilize a broad
and diverse domain of applicability that their processing capabilities can support with clear
technology paths. DARPA does not expect proposers to cover every material family, base material,
purity, or form of a material within their domain of applicability.
Within proposer defined domains of applicability, the Government team will provide materials for
periodic design trials as described in Section 1.4. Proposers should consider that rate is volumetric
to encourage a variety of material solutions regardless of density. Competitive proposals will
consider domains of applicability that would be available in a wide array of environments.
Characterize: establish error reduction to provide useable material property prediction for design.
R2
 will update and develop material informatics models to predict minimum material properties of
diverse material streams with high confidence according to the metrics in section 1.5. Proposers
may consider the use of online analysis (e.g., torque or power use) of the material conversion
process along with rapid testing (e.g., hardness) to achieve this goal, however, novel or processdependent approaches are encouraged. Proposers will be challenged to utilize material informatics 
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
“in reverse,” using a given new material and predicting property data as opposed to using material
data to predict a new material. Material property prediction should include feedstock production
and final manufacturing. Any anticipated heat treatment or post processing to improve material
properties should be included in the overall CONOPS. The primary objective is not to fully
characterize material properties, but to efficiently identify a lower bound design value for which
system level effects can be captured. Multiple common industry standard mechanical testing and
statistical approaches may be utilized to build and validate models. Balancing improved material
properties with error minimization is expected to present a broad solution space.
Adaptive Design: trained, low C-SWaP (Computational – Size, Weight, and Power) adaptive
design framework. R2
 will aim to efficiently update a base design to enable structural changes for
components with the newly predicted material properties that meets or exceeds the minimum range
metric as described in Section 1.5. Multiple evolving technologies of interest include change
propagation analysis, and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)-assisted finite element
analysis (FEA). Alternative and/or integrated approaches are highly encouraged to meet the
program objectives.
The adaptive design framework will assume a fixed outer mold line (OML) and maximum flight
loads for the Government sounding rocket design, then challenge proposers to build a trained model
which can rapidly (<1 hour) update the design, confirm viability, and predict impacts on range
given the available materials. Designs should be manufacturable based on the complete system
CONOPS integrating target manufacturing approach. Production of demonstration components to
validate material properties and designs is required.
Competitive proposals will feature a low C-SWaP that allows for processing on a standard-issue
laptop or similar basic computer. Any model training or analysis for development can be completed
using alternate computational resources. Competitive proposals will also include the ability for endusers to understand and choose between trade-offs in range and payload. DARPA is not interested
in a framework that is only capable of producing singular point designs for a given material.
1.3. Acquisition Strategy
The R2
 program consists of a single Technical Area (TA). Abstracts for the overall effort (Phase 1
and Phase 2) are sought in response to this PS.
The Government’s aim is to lower the administrative burden to entry, reduce program risk, foster
competition, and have performing teams begin work faster. To facilitate this objective, the
Government will use the following acquisition process for R2
:
1. Abstracts: Through this solicitation, the Government requests proposers to submit Abstracts
(see Section 3.2) in response to this PS. The Government will review all submitted
Abstracts for technical comprehension and ability (see Section 3.3). Selected proposers will
be invited to provide an Oral Presentation (see Section 3.4) to the Government.
2. Oral Presentations: Upon the Government’s request, proposers will have the opportunity to
present their proposal to the DARPA program team. The Government will evaluate all Oral
Presentations (see Section 3.5) and anticipate that selected proposers will enter into contract
negotiations for an OT award with a 36-month period of performance.
3. Phase 1 (base) (18 months): Phase 1 will be individually negotiated using an OT mechanism
for award. This phase will focus on converting indigenous feedstock to useable material,
characterizing the material properties, and adaptively updating and understanding the
system level design, with traceability to contested logistics environments.
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
4. Phase 2 (option) (18 month): Phase 2 will be a priced option. This phase will focus on
finding the limits of material conversion for structural designs by incorporating multiple
domains of applicability and increasingly diverse scavenged feedstocks. It is anticipated that
not all Phase 1 (base) performers will become Phase 2 (option) performers.
5. Phase 2 Demonstration (currently not being solicited) (6 months): at the conclusion of
Phase 2 (option), DARPA anticipates a demonstration phase for a static fire test. Proposers
can assume a Government test facility will be available as Government furnished equipment
(GFE) for this test. Phase 2 (option) performers will be given instructions on submitting
proposals during Phase 2 (option) of the program. It is anticipated not all Phase 2 (option)
performers will become Phase 2 Demonstration performers.
The process and requirements for Abstract and Oral Presentation submissions are detailed in
Section 2.1 of this PS. The anticipated timeline and major milestone for the acquisition strategy
laid out above is illustrated in Figure 3 (figure is not to scale).
Figure 3:Anticipated Acquisition Strategy Timeline (not to scale)
1.4. Program Structure
As shown in Figure 4, R2
 will be executed over Phase 1 (Base), Phase 2 (Option), and Phase 2
Demonstration (not currently being solicited). Performers will work with the Government team
throughout the program lifecycle to convey stakeholder interests, facilitate testing as required, and
connect performers with the operational community.
The anticipated events shown in Figure 4 are not a prescribed structure of milestone payments and
proposers should consider their technology development path and approach when setting proper
milestones. The design trial events are expected to occur at performer sites and may include
Government team observers. Each design trial will be preceded by a test readiness review (TRR)
conducted virtually. Design trials will consist of a provided fixed volume of material within the
performer’s domain of applicability and the performer will convert, predict material properties, and
update the design within the metric window. The pressure tests at the end of each primary phase
are expected to be conducted by the Government team at Government facilities using performer’s
manufactured vessels.
Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and design review meetings are expected to be held at
performer sites with Government team participation. In addition, DARPA and the Government
team expect to interact virtually with the performer teams in bi-weekly program update meetings.
Program kick-off and close-out events are expected to be held at DARPA in Arlington, Virginia.
Performers should also expect to write and submit quarterly and final reports. The final program
deliverable at the end of Phase 2 (option) is a validated system design (material conversion and
material property analytics) and accompanying design code and instructions for implementation. 
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
Phase 1 (Base)
Phase 1 (base) is an 18-month effort to establish proof-of-concept work for a new manufacturing
paradigm. Phase 1 (base) is motivated by the assumption that pristine indigenous materials can be
scavenged at or near point of need from local stockpiles. The primary focuses of this phase are risk
reduction, technology proof of concept, and integrated system design to validate potential
CONOPS. Performers will be challenged with an iterative series of design trials wherein performers
will be given sorted scavenged feedstock materials that progressively increase in diversity,
complexity, and/or contamination to convert into sounding rockets that meet the metrics specified
in section 1.5. Performers will only progress into converting increasingly diverse and challenging
material streams upon demonstrating successful Phase 1 metrics close out as validated by the
Government team.
Phase 2 (Option)
Phase 2 (option) is an 18-month effort centered around expanding the limits of material conversion
and adaptive design for structures. Phase 2 (option) is motivated by the assumption that a greater
set of indigenous materials may be available in local stockpiles in a non-pristine condition.
Performers are to produce and demonstrate a pilot-scale system capable of achieving the set Phase
2 (option) metrics while continuing to improve their adaptive design model framework created in
Phase 1 (base) with new, more complex material trials.
Phase 2 Demonstration (not currently being solicited)
The Phase 2 Demonstration would take place after the conclusion of Phase 2 (option). It would
consist of a 6-month effort in which a single performer would conduct an integrated static fire test
of a 200-350mm sounding rocket made entirely of converted materials with solid rocket fuel.
Figure 4: R2
 program lifecycle and phasing.
1.5. Program Goals/Metrics
R2
 metrics are fundamentally concerned with the following (also shown in Figure 5) within the
context of a deployable system, as defined earlier:
 Conversion: can you process the scavenged feedstock given into a manufacturable
material?
 Characterize: do you understand the material properties of the material you created?
 Adaptive Design: can you produce a feasible design with tailored range and payload
fraction?
R2
 aims to demonstrate material conversion at a rate of 0.1 m3
/day from scavenged processed
feedstock, verified by iterative design trials and pressure testing of representative rocket motor
chambers to simulate peak load survivability. Performers will also be measured on their ability to 
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
predict with low error the yield strength and elastic modulus of given materials (standard materials
analysis), the ability to update designs for minimum and variable range (measured by Government
team analysis tool set to be developed on the program), and confirming manufacturing capabilities
with a representative burst pressure test. For range flexibility, DARPA is not seeking a single point
design solution within a performer’s material domains of applicability; DARPA is seeking an
adaptive design framework that can dynamically produce multiple solutions which vary in
performance above the minimum 35 km threshold range.
* From the government determined scavenged feedstock streams, performers must identify a domain of applicability in which
metrics can be retired. Government will define feedstocks based on their ability to be indigenously scavenged, pristine refers to a
highly curated and predictable starting state.
** 200-350mm diameter vessel produced from performer selected domain of applicability.
*** Demonstration of capability at subscale sufficient.
Figure 5: R2
 baseline metric chart
Material property prediction evaluation: Performers are expected to utilize internal or commercial
test capacity to validate predictions. Proposers should identify the statistical methodologies which
will demonstrate predictive capacity of the approach. The goal is to demonstrate high confidence
in minimum values, not to fully characterize material properties. This should be applicable across
multiple proposer-defined domains of applicability (e.g., material type, composition space,
contaminate threshold, etc.). Proposers should identify how these domains of applicability fit into
their proposed CONOPS and ability to execute operation of the R2
 system globally. Diversity of
materials will be taken into consideration when evaluating proposals and DARPA intends to ensure
a wide variety of material systems are represented among performers.
Adaptive design tool evaluation: Proposers should demonstrate an ability to rapidly update a
Government-provided sounding rocket design with a new material. Performers will periodically be
challenged with Government provided material streams within their defined domains of
applicability for which they will predict material properties and update the design in the time
dictated in the metrics table. Performers should have the ability to vary payload size to achieve
selected ranges while closing on a viable rocket design with an overall minimum range of 35 km. 
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED
Performers may use typical ballistic calculations and publicly available data on potential propellent
performance to baseline range predictions. The adaptive design tool should be able to run on a
standard issue laptop or similar basic computer.
Burst pressure testing: Performers should anticipate producing pressure vessels as sub-components
of the standard sounding rocket design provided. These will be produced from Government
provided material streams within performer-defined domains of applicability. Performers will have
one week to design and begin production of the vessels and provide predictive performance to the
Government team. Burst pressure testing and posttest analysis will be provided by the Government.
Constraints: Performers should consider and justify how their system can be scaled in a deployable
configuration to > 0.1 m3
/day feedstock production.
Anticipated role of IV&V (Independent Verification and Validation): Periodic Design Trials will
be executed starting around months 6-9 of the program in which Government team members will
provide a curated subset of materials to performers to convert into feedstock and demonstrate a
design update based on material properties in < 1 week in Phase 1 (Base) and < 1 day in Phase 2
(Option). The IV&V team may monitor production at the performer site. The IV&V team is
anticipated to provide a tool for evaluation of anticipated range based on material and design
configurations from performers.
The primary risk of R2 is uncovering certain material and design combinations that will be unable
to produce viable structures. Performers will be challenged with increasingly variable and/or
diverse material streams to push the limits of usable materials. Ultimately, DARPA seeks to
understand the spectrum of material combinations from ideal to infeasible solutions.
During Phase 1 (base), performers should verify the analytical capabilities for both material
property prediction and adaptive design framework. Performers should demonstrate effective risk
mitigation and a path to system level capabilities which meet program objectives.
During Phase 2 (option), designs for a scaled pilot system should keep the following objectives in
mind: rocket is to be ground launched and non-human rated, with an objective range (>35 km);
contain a solid fuel system; and have a 200-350mm diameter. During Phase 2 (option), performance
will be validated in burst pressure testing in a 200-350mm vessel such as a sounding rocket.

Phase 1 effort to an offeror, DARPA may provide brief feedback to the offeror regarding the
rationale for the decision.
4. AWARDS
4.1. General Guidelines
Upon favorable review of the proposal and subject to the availability of funds, the Government may
choose to award an OT for Prototypes agreement for Phase 1 (base) and Phase 2 (option).
The Agreements Officer reserves the right to negotiate directly with the offeror on the terms and
conditions prior to execution of the resulting OT agreement, including payment terms, and will
execute the agreement on behalf of the Government. A copy of the draft OT agreement is attached
to this PS for review. In order to speed up negotiations, offerors selected for Oral Presentations will
be required to either attest to compliance of all OT agreement articles or note those they take
exception to. Be advised, only a Government Agreements Officer has the authority to enter into, or
modify, a binding agreement on behalf of the United States Government.
In order to receive an award:
a. Offerors must have a Unique Identity ID number and must register in the System for
Award Management (SAM). Offerors are advised to commence SAM registration upon
notification of entry to the competition.
b. Offerors must also register in the prescribed Government invoicing system (Wide Area
Work Flow: https://wawf.eb.mil/xhtml/unauth/registration/notice.xhtml). DARPA
Contracts Management Office (CMO) personnel will provide assistance to those offerors
from whom a proposal is requested.
c. Offerors must be determined to be responsible by the Agreements Officer and must not
be suspended or debarred from award by the Federal Government nor be prohibited by
Presidential Executive Order and/or law from receiving an award.

d. Being asked to submit a proposal does not guarantee that an offeror will receive an
award. The Government reserves the right not to make an award.
4.2. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Controlled Technical Information
(CTI) on Non-DoD Information Systems
Further information on Controlled Unclassified Information identification, marking, protecting
and control, to include processing on Non-DoD Information Systems, is incorporated herein and
can be found at www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/additional-baa. A program-specific CUI Guide has
been established to help offerors determine CUI thresholds for information relevant to, and
technologies developed under the program. As CTI is anticipated for this program, foreign proposers
are encouraged to understand U.S. export law and have a plan in place to obtain export licenses when
necessary. Possible methods include teaming with a U.S. prime and/or having a U.S.
subsidiary/parent company. The CUI Guide for R2
 is provided as an Appendix.
4.3. Representations and Certifications
All offerors are required to submit DARPA-specific representations and certifications for Prototype
OT awards in order to be eligible to receive an OT award. See http://www.darpa.mil/work-withus/reps-certs for further information on required representations and certifications for Prototype OT
awards.
4.4. Competition Sensitive Information
DARPA policy is to treat all submissions as competition sensitive, and to disclose their contents only
for the purpose of evaluation. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, during the evaluation process,
submissions may be handled by support contractors for administrative purposes and/or to assist with
technical evaluation. All DARPA support contractors performing this role are expressly prohibited
from performing DARPA sponsored technical research and are bound by appropriate nondisclosure
agreements. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from nonGovernment consultants/experts who are strictly bound by the appropriate non-disclosure
requirements.
4.5. Phase 1 & Phase 2 Intellectual Property / Data Rights
The Government will require Government purpose rights, as defined in Section 5 of this PS, to IP
developed under the program until an agreement is reached during negotiations for Phase 1 of R2
.
4.6. Procurement Integrity Act (PIA)
All awards under this PS shall be treated as Federal Agency procurements for purposes of 41 U.S.C.
Chapter 21. Accordingly, the PS competitive solicitation process and awards made thereof must
adhere to the ethical standards required by the PIA.
