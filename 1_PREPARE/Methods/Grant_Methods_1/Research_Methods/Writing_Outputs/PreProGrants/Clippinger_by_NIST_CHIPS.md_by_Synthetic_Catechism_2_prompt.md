CHIPS Technology Protection Guidebook
A resource for implementing applicant and performer research security requirements
The CHIPS and Science Act provides $50 billion to the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to
strengthen and revitalize the U.S. position in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing.
CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office (CPO), responsible for semiconductor incentives,
and the CHIPS Research and Development Office (CHIPS R&D), responsible for R&D programs, both
within the DOC National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). CHIPS R&D will invest $11 billion
to, among other goals, improve U.S. capacity to invent and deploy foundational semiconductor
technologies, including for economic and national security purposes.
Unfortunately, competitor nations have aggressively sought to acquire U.S. intellectual property (IP)
through licit and illicit means, including from academic and industry research organizations. Just as
companies protect their intellectual property, CHIPS R&D must protect federally funded research
products and the economic and national security advantages they provide.
As a result, CHIPS R&D programs, including intramural and extramural research programs, will require
applicants and research performers to implement research security measures. This document describes
the CHIPS R&D research security approach and aims to provide applicants and performers with
information to consider as they develop their own research security plans and programs. This guide is
supplemental to any CHIPS R&D funding opportunity and for informational purposes only (see disclaimer
on page 7 for more information).
Legislative Requirements and Context
Both Congress and the Executive Branch have sought to protect federally funded research and IP. Issued
in January 2021, National Security Presidential Memorandum-33 (NSPM-33) aims to “strengthen
protections of United States Government-supported R&D against foreign government interference and
exploitation.” NSPM-33 imposes disclosure requirements on federal funding recipients, seeks to
standardize reporting requirements across agencies, and requires organizations that receive more than
$50 million in annual federal R&D funding to implement their own research security programs. These
research security programs must address cybersecurity, foreign travel security, insider threat awareness
and identification, and, as appropriate, export control training. At the same time, Congress enacted into
law1 certain disclosure requirements, requiring “covered individuals” applying for federal R&D funds to
disclose the amount, type, and source of all current and pending research support, including both
monetary and non-monetary support.
Multiple Government and private-sector entities have issued documentation to support these research
security requirements. In August 2023, NIST released NIST IR 8484 Safeguarding International Science
Research Security Framework (“the Framework”), designed to help agencies and other interested
1 Section 223 of Division A, Title II of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21), (Pub. L. No 116–283, codified in 42 U.S.C. § 6605)
CHIPS for America Guidebook

entities balance the traditional openness in the research community, research security, and
international collaboration. The Framework outlines methodologies and requirements for an integrated,
mission-focused, risk-balanced approach for safeguarding international science and technology from
undue foreign interference while protecting the openness and integrity of the U.S. research ecosystem.
Addressing Research Security in CHIPS R&D Funding Applications
Leveraging the Framework, this guide seeks to provide potential applicants with best practices and highlevel issues to address when including a research security plan or research security program in an
application for CHIPS R&D funding. Notably, the guide focuses on research security considerations not
limited to foreign collaborations.
CHIPS R&D recommends that a proposed research security plan or program discuss the following key
elements, where applicable:
1. Establishing a Research Security Team and Methodology
2. Assessing At-risk Technologies and IP
3. Reviewing Personnel Appointments
4. Training Research Personnel and Staff
5. Reviewing Personnel Appointments
6. Reviewing Foreign Travel Requests
7. Reviewing Collaboration and Service Requests
8. Implementing Technology Control (e.g., Data Management and Export Controls)
9. Cybersecurity
Establishing a Research Security Team and Methodology
Effective research security begins with leadership commitment and establishing a team, which may
include contracted staff, to develop and execute best practices and policies. Broad representation
from across the organization can help ensure a shared understanding of both research security needs,
promote acceptance of research security norms, and enable the incorporation of research security
into other organizational objectives.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. A research security Point of Contact (POC), including the POC name, position, and e-mail
2. Research security team members, including persons with expertise relevant to, if applicable:
a. Scientific research
b. Export control
c. Information security
d. Research and technology protection
e. International engagement
f. Cybersecurity
3. Additional ad hoc team members (e.g., legal counsel)
4. Specific roles and responsibilities for each team member
5. The expected scope of work (i.e., the reviews and assessments the team will conduct)
6. Organizational policies that define the research security team mission, methodologies for
determining research security risks, and a process to adjudicate and approve relevant activities
CHIPS for America Guidebook
■ ■ ■
3
Assessing At-risk Technologies and IP
CHIPS R&D has unique statutory requirements to ensure that federally funded IP remains subject to
domestic control, to protect it from foreign adversaries. Consistent with this requirement and with
other best practices, CHIPS R&D funding opportunities may ask proposers to identify pre-existing IP,
IP that may be developed, and a plan for ensuring domestic control.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. Any technologies or IP used or created during the research that may warrant protection from
foreign adversaries, including technologies or IP resulting from fundamental research2
2. Processes to compartmentalize fundamental and non-fundamental research products and to
enable pre-publication reviews of non-fundamental research products, if applicable
3. Concurrence with CHIPS R&D domestic control requirements and any required policies or
procedures to ensure compliance
4. Any additional organizational strategies to protect intellectual property
Reviewing Personnel Appointments
It is NIST policy to create a culture of personal and organizational responsibility where the practice
and management of research and its products are free from undue influence and interference not
essential to the practice of science. Consistent with this policy and with NSPM-33, effective research
security programs should identify and mitigate potential conflicts of interest or conflicts of
commitment that could jeopardize scientific integrity or research products.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. Processes for the organization to identify, and for personnel to report, organizational affiliations
and commitments, including to meet the requirements of the Current and Pending Support Form
2. Processes for the organization to identify and address any potential conflicts of interest or
conflicts of commitment, including malign foreign affiliations and funding
2 For further information on identifying and protecting critical IP and technologies, consider reviewing the National
Counterintelligence and Security Center Operations Security (OPSEC) Cycle. 
CHIPS for America Guidebook

Training Research Personnel and Staff
Communication and training ensure that employees and other research staff understand the need for
research security protections, can identify research security risks and assess the benefits of
collaboration, and consistently implement research security best practices. This training may include
ongoing required training on broad topics and ad hoc instruction for specific situations or specific
research programs, such as foreign travel, remote work, or export controls.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. The scope, frequency, and source of any regular required training provided to research personnel
and other staff, to include instruction on topics such as:
a. Research integrity
b. Research and technology protection
c. Cybersecurity Identifying foreign talent recruitment programs
d. Insider threat awareness and identification
e. Securing research-related data
f. Other responsibilities consistent with NSPM-33
2. The scope and source of any situational or program-specific training provided to research
personnel and other staff
3. Any additional strategies for communicating research security incidents and concerns
Reviewing Foreign Travel Requests
NIST adheres to the principle that U.S. research leadership benefits from mutually beneficial
international collaboration. However, to protect federally funded IP from foreign adversaries, CHIPS
R&D statute prohibits funding a foreign entity of concern. Further, CHIPS R&D expects funded
research to occur in the United States, absent NIST approval.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. Internal processes for research personnel and staff to report foreign travel (including virtual
conference/meeting attendance) if CHIPS R&D-related work will be conducted overseas
2. Procedures to evaluate the risks and benefits of work-related foreign travel, based on factors
such as event type, purpose, and host organization
3. Processes to ensure that overseas travel does not provide a foreign entity of concern access to
CHIPS-R&D funded research products
4. Provisions to provide research security briefings prior to foreign travel, to review data and device
security measures and to, if necessary, remove project-related data from devices prior to travel
5. Provisions for personnel and staff, upon conclusion of foreign travel, to report any foreign
adversary recruitment efforts or possible research compromises, if applicable
CHIPS for America Guidebook
■ ■ ■
5
Reviewing Collaboration and Service Requests
CHIPS R&D encourages collaborative research between entities across the domestic semiconductor
value chain, to include international collaboration, subject to NIST approval. Other entities may also
seek access to CHIPS-funded tools, services, and information. In each case, the award recipient must
adhere to research security requirements, including the protection of research conducted by their
collaboration partners.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. Processes for research personnel to report requests for collaboration or services (e.g., access to
databases and tools), including foreign requests, and for notifying CHIPS R&D, as appropriate
2. Processes for evaluating the affiliations of prospective collaborators or service recipients, with
criteria for approval
3. Processes to assess what technologies or IP, including technology or IP relevant to military
applications, may be transferred as a result of the proposed partnership and for ensuring the
application of appropriate export controls or other CHIPS R&D-specific protections, as relevant
Implementing Records Management, Cybersecurity, and Export Controls
Effective research security requires managing research documents and records. NIST, NSPM-33, and
other federal Government policies and best practices often require activities to protect federally
funded research data, including by addressing cybersecurity and export control concerns.
Applicants should consider identifying the following:
1. An up-to-date technology control plan, to protect against unauthorized transfer of IP and product
groups
2. Compliance with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
In addition to the above, applicants may describe, if applicable, a timeline to enhance any existing
research security efforts and plans to inform CHIPS R&D of substantive changes (e.g., new personnel or
collaborators). Applicants seeking additional information shall consult the Framework, which includes
relevant checklists, or contact the NIST Research Security and Safeguarding International Science Team
(researchsecurity@nist.gov).

National Institute of Standards and Technology: Safeguarding International Science Research Security Framework,
NIST IR 8484 (2023)


“Advanced packaging” refers to many chips with diverse functions assembled tightly together on a
substrate in two or three dimensions at extremely fine dimensions. This method achieves function,
performance, and power savings far greater than can be achieved with conventionally packaged chips
on a printed circuit board. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, for example, would not be possible
without advanced packaging.
Advanced packaging can be a transformative capability that helps U.S. manufacturers compete globally,
but there are many technological challenges to solve. The CHIPS Research and Development Office has
established the CHIPS National Advanced Packaging Manufacturing Program to address these
challenges, including:
• How do we design and assemble chips so tightly that they behave like a single traditional
large chip, but with the production efficiency and cost savings of advanced packaging?
• How do we supply power to and dissipate heat from such tightly coupled assemblies?
• How do we test and repair such complex assemblies?
CHIPS for America Fact Sheet ■ ■ ■
2
• How do we ensure their reliability since traditional methods of visual inspection cannot be
performed on such small, tightly packaged dimensions?
The CHIPS NAPMP will enable the development of a robust domestic advanced packaging ecosystem by:
• Establishing an advanced packaging piloting facility (or facilities) that accelerates the
transfer of innovations in packaging, equipment, and process development into
manufacturing;
• Driving the development of digital tools to reduce the time and cost of advanced packaging
engineering; and,
• Establishing and supporting partnerships among industry, academia and training entities,
and government to contribute to an advanced packaging workforce.
The six priority research investment areas of the CHIPS NAPMP are:
• Materials and substrates
• Equipment, tools, and processes
• Power delivery and thermal management for advanced packaging assemblies
• Photonics and connectors that communicate with the outside world
• A chiplet ecosystem
• Co-design of multi-chiplet systems with automated tools



Semiconductors are arguably the smallest, most complex products ever made in one of the world’s most
sophisticated manufacturing environments. Although U.S. innovation created the sector, domestic
manufacturing currently accounts for about 12% of global production, compared to 37% approximately
thirty years ago. To improve its manufacturing competitiveness, the United States must address key
challenges, such as the time and cost of chip development and manufacturing processes, as well as
talent shortages.
Unlike traditional, physical research models, digital twins can exist in the cloud, which enables
collaborative design and process development by engineers and researchers across the country, creating
new opportunities for participation, speeding innovation, and reducing costs of research and
development. Digital twin-based research can also leverage emerging technology like artificial
intelligence to help accelerate the design of new U.S. chip development and manufacturing concepts
and significantly reduce costs by improving capacity planning, production optimization, facility upgrades,
and real-time process adjustments. 
CHIPS for America Fact Sheet
■ ■ ■

By convening the manufacturing ecosystem to solve shared technology challenges, a new Manufacturing
USA institute aims to unlock the full potential of digital twins for the semiconductor industry and benefit
manufacturers of all sizes.
To facilitate the creation of the CHIPS Manufacturing USA institute, this NOFO seeks proposals from
eligible applicants for activities to establish and operate the institute, consistent with the mission and
vision, to achieve the following specific objectives:
• Convene stakeholders across the semiconductor manufacturing, advanced packaging,
assembly, and test industry to address shared challenges relevant to digital twins, in a
collaborative environment.
• Improve the state of the art in manufacturing-relevant digital twins, for both unit-level
digital twins and the combination of multiple digital twins.
• Significantly reduce U.S. chip development and manufacturing costs by improving capacity
planning, production optimization, facility upgrades, and real-time process adjustments
using digital twins.
• Improve development cycle times of semiconductor manufacturing, advanced packaging,
assembly, and test and accelerate the development and adoption of relevant innovative
technologies, including breakthrough tools, materials, and manufacturing processes.
• Advance digital twin-enabled curricula, best practices, and hands-on opportunities for
training the next generation of the domestic semiconductor workforce.
• Create a digital twin marketplace for industry to access digital models and manufacturing
process flows and to de-risk digital twin development and implementation.

CHIPS R&D Commercial Viability and Domestic Production (CVDP) Plan Guidebook
A resource for implementing applicant and performer responses to CHIPS R&D funding
opportunities
The CHIPS and Science Act provides $50 billion to the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to
strengthen and revitalize the U.S. position in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing.
CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office (CPO), responsible for semiconductor
manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office (CHIPS R&D), responsible for
R&D programs. Both offices sit within the DOC National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
CHIPS R&D will invest $11 billion to ensure, among other objectives, that new technologies achieve
commercial scale as quickly and cost effectively as possible, including for economic competitiveness and
national security purposes. As a result, each CHIPS R&D funding opportunity will require applicants and
research performers to provide updateable plans for ensuring, to the extent possible, the commercial
viability and domestic production of federally-funded research.
This document provides applicants and performers with information to consider as they propose and
implement Commercial Viability and Domestic Production (CVDP) plans. This guide is supplemental to
any CHIPS R&D Notices of Funding Opportunity and is provided for informational purposes only; see
disclaimer below.
Legislative Requirements and Context
Congress, federal agencies, and U.S. taxpayers have a vested interest in ensuring that federally funded
research achieves commercial scale and enhances domestic manufacturing, which promotes job growth,
supply chain resiliency, and consumer benefit.
In passing the CHIPS Act
1
, Congress required that the Department establish new policies for the
domestic production, to the extent possible, of CHIPS-funded intellectual property (IP) and for the
domestic control of such IP to protect it from foreign adversaries. In response, CHIPS R&D expects to
prioritize funding applications that demonstrate a viable path towards commercializing innovations and
towards for domestic production.

 CHIPS R&D Education and Workforce Development (EWD) Plan Guidebook
A resource for developing an education and workforce development plan in response to
CHIPS R&D funding opportunities.
The CHIPS and Science Act provides $50 billion to the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) to
strengthen and revitalize the U.S. position in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing.
CHIPS for America includes the CHIPS Program Office (CPO), responsible for semiconductor
manufacturing incentives, and the CHIPS Research and Development Office (CHIPS R&D), responsible for
R&D programs. Both offices sit within the DOC National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
CHIPS R&D will invest $11 billion to ensure, among other objectives, that the United States develops and
maintains a robust semiconductor workforce where inventors, designers, researchers, developers,
engineers, technicians, and staff can meet evolving domestic government and commercial sector needs.
To help meet these objectives, Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFOs) released by the CHIPS R&D
Office will often require applicants to submit an education and workforce development (EWD) plan.
This guidebook serves as a resource for applicants responding to NOFOs requiring an EWD plan. This
guidebook is supplemental to CHIPS R&D Office NOFOs and is for informational purposes only. NOFOs
contain the official rules for their respective competitions. Nothing in this guidebook should be
interpreted as superseding or contradicting anything in a NOFO. Any actual or perceived conflicts
between this guidebook and any published CHIPS R&D NOFO must be resolved in favor of the NOFO.
Legislative Requirements and Context
Recognizing the importance of a diverse and skilled pipeline of workers to the success of the CHIPS Act1
,
Congress charged DOC, and other agencies, to integrate workforce development into new R&D efforts2
.
Various executive orders further direct priorities for developing a robust and diverse workforce,
including Executive Order 14080, the Implementation of the CHIPS Act of 2022 (Aug. 25, 2022); Executive
Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal
Government (Jan. 20, 2021); and Executive Order 14091, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support
for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government (Feb. 16, 2023).
DOC has further emphasized its commitment to workforce development, including through its
Workforce Development Strategy. Grounded in the need to develop a skilled workforce to promote and
maintain U.S. leadership in technological innovation and global competitiveness, the Strategy outlines
11 principles for highly effective workforce investments. DOC and the Department of Labor also
partnered to develop the Good Jobs Principles, which seek to establish a shared vision of job quality.

Consistent with the objectives of Congress and the Administration, the CHIPS R&D Office seeks to fund
projects with EWD activities that align with the Workforce Development Strategy and support good jobs
that will benefit American workers and help sustain the domestic semiconductor industry.
Addressing Education and Workforce Development in CHIPS R&D Funding Applications
This guide seeks to provide potential applicants with best practices and key considerations for
developing an EWD plan that addresses domestic workforce needs. The CHIPS R&D Office recommends
EWD plans include the following elements, where applicable:
1. Workforce Needs Assessment
2. Metrics and Milestones (SMART Targets)
3. Proven, Industry-Relevant Training
4. Demonstrated Strategic Partnerships
5. Worker Recruitment and Retention Information
While the CHIPS R&D Office encourages applicants to align their EWD plans with DOC’s Workforce
Development Strategy and the Good Jobs Principles, the CHIPS R&D Office recognizes that not every
principle will be applicable to every research and development project or NOFO.
Workforce Needs Assessment
As a first step in presenting an EWD plan, the CHIPS R&D Office recommends that applicants quantify
and articulate relevant workforce needs for some portion or portions of the semiconductor industry3
.
This workforce needs assessment can account for the skills and number of workers required to (1)
meet current and expected workforce needs within a specific company and (2) contribute more
broadly to a robust domestic semiconductor workforce.
When developing EWD plans, applicants are advised to consider:
1. The current workforce by occupation, skill set, wage, and demographics4
2. The pool of available workers with relevant or related skills, including from underserved
communities
3. The projected available and demanded workforce with relevant or related skills
4. Any workforce challenges to address (e.g., current skills shortages, persistent vacancies,
education and training program gaps)
5. If applicable, current barriers to filling identified skill and personnel gaps
6. Description of how the applicant will regularly update the needs assessment
Metrics and Milestones (SMART Targets)
The DOC Workforce Development Strategy emphasizes measuring and tracking outcomes. Similarly,
CHIPS R&D NOFOs often emphasize the need for SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant,
and time-bound) metrics and milestones, including for EWD programs. SMART targets help ensure
3 The CHIPS Program Office (CPO) has published a Workforce Development Planning Guide for applicants responding to NOFOs
under the CHIPS Incentives Program. Section A.6.4 (p. 94) of this Planning Guide contains a list of resources that may be used
for understanding the workforce landscape. 4 Sources of demographic information may include the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Department of
Education. Applicants may also want to consult with their local workforce boards. 
CHIPS for America Guidebook ■ ■ ■
3
that the applicant can evaluate, scale, or modify its EWD plan based on their level of success. SMART
goals can also help demonstrate that EWD programs align with NOFO objectives, timelines, and
resources.
When developing EWD plans, applicants are advised to consider:
1. Specific goals the applicant establishes for EWD activities, the entity designated to implement
tactics to achieve those specific goals, and how the activities will be tailored to the communities
they serve
2. Quantifiable metrics to demonstrate impact, such as the number of workers enrolled and trained,
incumbent workers retrained or upskilled, persons placed in a job, or the percentage
improvement in employee earnings and retention
3. Evidence that the organization can attain its EWD targets within the time proposed, based on
factors such as available resources, past experience, or existing partnerships with proven
academic or labor groups
4. Information demonstrating the relevance of the EWD activities to the funded research or to
industry, consistent with the NOFO objectives and workforce needs assessment
5. Projected deadlines for achieving both final and intermediate EWD targets, with metrics for
evaluating progress during the period of performance
6. A process, including resources and data, for evaluating EWD activities over time, such as a plan to
report such progress to CHIPS R&D and its designated third parties, if applicable
Proven, Industry-Relevant Training
The DOC Workforce Development Strategy emphasizes EWD activities that result in workers hired
and retained, with highly effective workforce investments emphasizing: (1) employer-led programs,
to connect skilled workers to quality jobs, (2) programs that lead to stackable, industry-recognized
credentials, and (3) leveraging proven earn-and-learn models like registered apprenticeships. EWD
proposals to CHIPS R&D NOFOs can similarly align to specific job opportunities and skills needs,
consistent with the workforce needs assessment, and leverage known best practices.
When developing EWD plans, applicants are advised to consider:
1. Including proven training models (such as registered apprenticeships), best practices, curriculum,
and pedagogy for training or up/re-skilling new, incumbent, or returning workers
2. Engaging with K-12 institutions, Career and Technical Education (CTE) providers, labor
organizations, and community-based solution providers to strengthen pathways for the future
R&D workforce to access careers in manufacturing, design, research, and packaging, if
appropriate
3. Aligning with current or proposed industry-wide or internally developed competency standards,
skill requirements, or with requirements for stackable, industry-recognized credentials or
certifications
4. Efforts to support the hiring of participants that have successfully completed EWD programs by
specific industry partners, into good jobs
CHIPS for America Guidebook ■ ■ ■

Demonstrated Strategic Partnerships
The Department believes that highly effective workforce investments: (1) are guided by multiple
community partners, including education institutions, labor unions, community-based organizations,
and economic development organizations, (2) build sustainable systems that serve employers and
workers beyond the federal investment, and (3) leverage the use of other government and private
funding. CHIPS R&D Office NOFOs therefore encourage applicants to develop EWD plans in
collaboration with strategic partners.
When developing EWD plans, applicants are advised to consider:
1. Outreach to underserved communities and engagement with partner institutions that deliver
quality employment and training pathways, such as labor organizations, government agencies,
and industry organizations, including local employers in the semiconductor or adjacent fields
2. Commitments from such partner organizations with letters of commitment describing the roles
and responsibilities of each participating entity and the resources each will provide
3. Opportunities to sustain or scale successful EWD activities beyond the period of performance,
including through the receipt of other Federal or non-Federal funds
4. Past, current, or pending support for the proposed and/or existing EWD efforts from other
Federal entities
Worker Recruitment and Retention Information
In assessing its own EWD efforts, DOC has committed to helping workers of all backgrounds secure
good jobs, including through partnerships to recruit, develop, and retain a diverse, skilled workforce.
DOC further found that workers value jobs that provide stability and security and that offering these
jobs gives companies a competitive edge in hiring. In support of these efforts, the DOC Workforce
Development Strategy identifies multiple principles that benefit employee recruitment and retention
from all communities, including: (1) offering wrap-around services, (2) increasing educational and
workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion, and (3) preparing individuals for jobs that are in demand by
employers.
When developing EWD plans, applicants are advised to consider:
1. New or expanded opportunities for individuals to participate in the semiconductor industry
workforce, including for populations underrepresented in the industry
2. Investments in supportive services such as childcare, transportation, and housing and the
promotion of a safe and respectful workforce culture that prevents harassment and
discrimination
3. Demonstrated links between the skills to be developed and in-demand, high-quality jobs such as
those consistent with the Good Jobs Principles, which emphasizes employment likely to provide
“family-sustaining benefits that promote economic security and mobility”
