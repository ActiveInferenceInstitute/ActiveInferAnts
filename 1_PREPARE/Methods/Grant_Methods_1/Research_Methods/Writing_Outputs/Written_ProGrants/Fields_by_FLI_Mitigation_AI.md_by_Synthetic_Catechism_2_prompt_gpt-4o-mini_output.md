# Grant Proposal: Empowering Human Agency in an AI-Driven World

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

### Core Problem and Opportunity
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to concentrate power among a select few corporations and individuals, leading to potential tyranny, economic disparity, and the erosion of individual agency. Our project aims to address this critical issue by exploring the development of "Public AI" systems that prioritize public control, accountability, and human-centered design.

### Project Purpose
We propose to create a framework for developing AI systems that are governed by public interests rather than corporate profit motives. This initiative seeks to empower individuals and communities, ensuring that AI serves as a tool for enhancing human agency rather than diminishing it.

### Inspiration
The project was inspired by the recognition that current AI systems often exacerbate existing inequalities and power imbalances. Our interdisciplinary research into cognition, consciousness, and information theory has illuminated pathways for creating AI that aligns with human values and societal needs.

### Alignment with Mission
This initiative aligns with our mission to foster understanding and innovation at the intersection of technology and human experience. By advocating for a more equitable distribution of AI capabilities, we aim to contribute to a future where technology enhances rather than undermines human agency.

### Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
- **Objective 1:** Develop a comprehensive framework for Public AI systems.
  - **KR1:** Conduct stakeholder interviews and workshops with at least 100 participants.
  - **KR2:** Publish a white paper detailing design specifications for Public AI.
- **Objective 2:** Evaluate the effectiveness of Public AI in promoting human agency.
  - **KR1:** Implement a pilot Public AI project in a community setting.
  - **KR2:** Measure user satisfaction and agency enhancement through surveys and interviews.

### Advancement of Knowledge
This project will advance knowledge in the fields of AI governance, cognitive science, and information theory by providing a novel framework for public accountability in AI systems. It will also contribute to ongoing discussions about the ethical implications of AI and its impact on society.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

### State of the Art
Currently, AI development is dominated by a few large corporations that prioritize profit over public good. While there are efforts towards open-source AI, these often fail to mitigate power concentration effectively.

### Key Players
Key players include major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, which have significant influence over AI development and deployment. Thought leaders in AI ethics and governance, such as Timnit Gebru and Kate Crawford, are also shaping the discourse.

### Limitations and Gaps
Existing solutions often lack transparency and accountability, leading to a disconnect between AI capabilities and societal needs. There is a pressing need for frameworks that prioritize public interests and ensure equitable access to AI technologies.

### Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
The project will navigate complex regulatory landscapes surrounding AI governance, data privacy, and ethical use of technology. We will engage with legal experts to ensure compliance and address potential ethical dilemmas.

### Relevance of the Project
Recent societal shifts, including increased awareness of AI's societal impacts and calls for equitable technology, make this project timely and relevant. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need for resilient and inclusive technological solutions.

### Paradigm Shift
Our project challenges the current paradigm of AI development by advocating for a model that prioritizes public control and accountability, moving away from profit-driven motives.

## 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

### Novelty of Approach
Our approach is groundbreaking in its emphasis on "Public AI" systems that are designed with community input and oversight. This contrasts sharply with traditional corporate models that prioritize profit.

### Improvement Over Alternatives
By focusing on public accountability and user empowerment, our framework seeks to mitigate the risks associated with AI-driven power concentration, offering a viable alternative to existing corporate-centric models.

### Methodologies
We will employ a combination of information theory, active inference, and participatory design methodologies to develop our framework. This interdisciplinary approach will ensure that our solutions are grounded in both theoretical rigor and practical applicability.

### Preliminary Studies
Preliminary research has indicated that community-driven AI initiatives can enhance user trust and satisfaction. We will build on these findings to inform our project design.

### Scalability and Adaptability
The proposed framework is designed to be scalable and adaptable to various contexts, allowing for implementation in diverse communities and settings.

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
