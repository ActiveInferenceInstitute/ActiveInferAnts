# Grant Proposal for Open Source Software Development in Active Inference and Computational Psychiatry

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**  
Our project addresses the critical need for open-source software that facilitates research and application of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle in computational psychiatry. The current landscape lacks accessible tools that allow researchers and practitioners to model complex cognitive and psychiatric phenomena effectively.

**Project Purpose**  
We aim to develop a suite of open-source software tools that enable users to implement Active Inference models for understanding perception, learning, and decision-making in psychiatric contexts. This initiative will democratize access to advanced computational methods, fostering innovation and collaboration in the field.

**Inspiration**  
The project was inspired by the growing recognition of the need for integrative approaches in psychiatry, particularly those that leverage computational models to enhance understanding of mental health disorders. Our work at Versus Research Lab and our affiliations with McGill University and Jewish General Hospital have highlighted the potential of these frameworks.

**Alignment with Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to advance knowledge in complex systems and computational psychiatry while promoting open science. Our commitment to integrated science and collaborative research reflects our values and strategic goals.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop and release at least 20% of the custom-developed code as open-source software within the first year.
2. Create comprehensive documentation for all software modules to facilitate reuse and adaptation.
3. Engage at least 100 researchers and practitioners in the first year to utilize and provide feedback on the software.

**Advancement of Knowledge**  
This project will advance knowledge by providing tools that enable empirical testing of Active Inference models in psychiatric contexts, thereby contributing to the theoretical and practical understanding of mental health.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art**  
Currently, the field of computational psychiatry lacks robust, user-friendly software tools that are openly accessible. Most existing solutions are proprietary, limiting collaboration and innovation.

**Key Players**  
Key players include academic institutions, private companies developing proprietary software, and research labs focused on computational models in psychology and psychiatry.

**Limitations and Gaps**  
Existing solutions often do not incorporate the latest advancements in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. Furthermore, they lack the flexibility and transparency that open-source software provides.

**Regulatory Considerations**  
We will adhere to NISTâ€™s directives on open-source software development, ensuring compliance with federal regulations regarding software reuse.

**Recent Technological Advancements**  
The rise of open-source software and collaborative platforms has created an environment conducive to sharing and innovation, making this project timely and relevant.
