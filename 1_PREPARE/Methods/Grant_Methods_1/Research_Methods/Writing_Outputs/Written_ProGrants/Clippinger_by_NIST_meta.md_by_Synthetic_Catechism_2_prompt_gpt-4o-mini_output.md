# Grant Proposal for NIST: Advancing Decentralized Governance through Natural AI and Active Inference

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**  
The project addresses the critical need for adaptive governance structures that can effectively respond to the complexities of modern societal challenges, including climate change, economic inequality, and digital rights. Current institutions often fail to scale and adapt, leading to inefficiencies and inequities.

**Project Purpose**  
Our initiative aims to develop a framework for decentralized governance that leverages principles of natural AI and active inference to enhance decision-making processes. This will empower individuals and communities by providing them with tools for self-sovereign identity and participatory governance.

**Inspiration**  
This project was inspired by the transformative potential of decentralized technologies and the need for governance models that prioritize life-centric principles. The work of Carl Friston on active inference has profoundly influenced our understanding of intelligence and decision-making.

**Alignment with Organizational Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to advance measurement science and technology by creating standards for decentralized governance that enhance economic security and improve quality of life. 

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a prototype for a decentralized governance model using active inference principles within 12 months.
2. Engage at least 500 stakeholders in pilot testing and feedback sessions.
3. Publish a comprehensive report on the impact of the model on decision-making processes by the end of the project.

**Advancement of Knowledge**  
This project will advance knowledge in the fields of governance, AI, and complexity science by providing empirical data on the effectiveness of decentralized models in real-world applications.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis
