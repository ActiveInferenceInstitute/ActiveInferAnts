# Grant Proposal for NIST: Advancing Measurement Science through Active Inference and Complex Systems

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity:**
The project aims to address the limitations in current measurement science and standards development by integrating the principles of Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle into the modeling of complex systems. This innovative approach will enhance our understanding of dynamic systems, improve predictive accuracy, and ultimately contribute to advancements in measurement standards.

**Project Purpose:**
Our project seeks to develop a framework that utilizes Active Inference to create more robust models of complex systems, thereby enhancing measurement science and standards in various fields, including healthcare, environmental science, and technology.

**Inspiration:**
The inspiration for this project stems from the recognition that traditional measurement approaches often overlook the dynamic and interconnected nature of systems. By applying principles from computational psychiatry and complex systems theory, we aim to create a more holistic understanding of measurement.
