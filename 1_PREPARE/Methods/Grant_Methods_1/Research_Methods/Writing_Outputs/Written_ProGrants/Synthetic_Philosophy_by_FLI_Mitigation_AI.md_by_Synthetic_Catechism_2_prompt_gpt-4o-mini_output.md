# Grant Proposal: Empowering Human Agency in the Age of AI

## I. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem or Opportunity**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to concentrate power within a select few organizations and individuals, undermining democratic values and individual agency. Our project seeks to address this pressing issue by developing frameworks and systems that promote equitable AI governance and empower individuals through decentralized technologies.

**Project Purpose**  
Our initiative aims to create a model for "Public AI" that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and community engagement. By fostering a collaborative approach to AI development, we can ensure that technology serves the collective good rather than the interests of a privileged few.

**Inspiration for the Project**  
The inspiration for this project stems from a growing concern about the implications of AI on societal structures and individual freedoms. The need for a paradigm shift towards a more inclusive and participatory model of AI governance has never been more urgent.

**Alignment with Mission and Values**  
This initiative aligns with our commitment to promoting relational autonomy, care ethics, and social responsibility. By advocating for a decentralized approach to AI, we aim to create systems that reflect the diverse needs and values of our communities.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a prototype for a Public AI system that incorporates community feedback and ethical considerations.
2. Engage at least 500 stakeholders in workshops to co-create governance frameworks for AI deployment.
3. Publish a comprehensive report on the implications of decentralized AI governance within the first year.

**Advancement of Knowledge or Practice**  
This project will advance knowledge in the field of AI governance by providing empirical data on the effectiveness of decentralized models. It will also contribute to the discourse on ethical AI by integrating care ethics into technological frameworks.

## II. Current Landscape Analysis

**Current State of the Art**  
The current landscape is dominated by corporate-driven AI models that prioritize profit over public good. While there are emerging discussions around open-source AI, these efforts often fail to address the underlying power dynamics that perpetuate inequality.

**Key Players and Thought Leaders**  
Key players include major tech corporations, academic institutions, and civil society organizations advocating for ethical AI. However, many of these entities operate within a framework that does not adequately challenge the status quo of power concentration.

**Limitations or Gaps**  
Existing solutions often lack mechanisms for public accountability and fail to engage marginalized communities in the decision-making process. There is a critical need for frameworks that prioritize collective agency and ethical considerations in AI deployment.

**Regulatory, Legal, or Ethical Considerations**  
The regulatory landscape is still evolving, with many jurisdictions struggling to keep pace with technological advancements. Ethical considerations must include the potential for surveillance and the erosion of privacy rights.

**Recent Technological Advancements**  
The rise of decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and federated learning, presents new opportunities for creating systems that empower individuals and communities. These advancements make our project timely and relevant.

**Fit into or Challenge Current Paradigms**  
Our project challenges the prevailing paradigm of centralized AI governance by proposing a model that prioritizes public control and accountability. This shift is essential for mitigating the risks associated with AI-driven power concentration.

## III. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novel or Groundbreaking Approach**  
Our approach is innovative in its emphasis on community-driven AI governance. By integrating care ethics and relational autonomy into the design of AI systems, we aim to create technologies that reflect collective values and needs.

**Differentiation from Existing Alternatives**  
Unlike existing models that prioritize corporate interests, our Public AI framework focuses on transparency, accountability, and community engagement. This approach ensures that AI serves the public good rather than exacerbating existing inequalities.

**Specific Technologies and Methodologies**  
We will employ participatory design methodologies, leveraging workshops and community engagement to co-create governance frameworks. Additionally, we will utilize decentralized technologies to ensure transparency and accountability in AI deployment.

**Preliminary Experiments or Pilot Studies**  
We have conducted preliminary workshops with community stakeholders, which revealed a strong desire for greater involvement in AI governance. Feedback from these sessions will inform the development of our Public AI prototype.

**Scalability and Adaptability**  
The proposed model is designed to be scalable across various contexts and adaptable to different community needs. By leveraging decentralized technologies, we can ensure that the framework remains relevant as societal conditions evolve.

**Interdisciplinary Approaches and Collaborations**  
Our project will leverage interdisciplinary collaborations with ethicists, technologists, and community organizers to ensure a holistic approach to AI governance.

## IV. Impact and Significance Assessment

**Primary Beneficiaries**
