# Grant Proposal for the Fuller Worldview Initiative: Empowering Human Agency through Decentralized AI

## I. Comprehensive Project Catechism

### 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity:**  
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens to concentrate power among a select few corporations and individuals, undermining democratic processes and individual agency. This project seeks to address this issue by promoting decentralized AI systems that empower individuals and communities, aligning with R. Buckminster Fuller's vision of a sustainable and equitable world.

**Project Purpose:**  
Our initiative aims to develop a framework for decentralized AI governance, ensuring that AI technologies serve humanity rather than concentrate power. We will create a model for "Public AI," which emphasizes community control, transparency, and accountability.

**Inspiration:**  
The project is inspired by Fuller's principles of "Spaceship Earth" and "Livingry," which advocate for the responsible use of technology to enhance human living conditions. The urgency of addressing AI-driven power concentration has never been greater, making this project timely and necessary.

**Alignment with Mission:**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to promote synergetic solutions that foster human agency and sustainability. By leveraging Fuller's comprehensive anticipatory design science, we will create a model that addresses the systemic risks posed by AI.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**  
1. Develop a prototype for a decentralized AI governance model by Year 1.
2. Engage at least 500 community stakeholders in the design process by Year 2.
3. Publish a comprehensive report on the effectiveness of decentralized AI systems by Year 3.

**Advancement of Knowledge:**  
This project will contribute to the field of AI governance by providing a novel framework that challenges existing paradigms of power concentration. Our approach will integrate Fuller's synergetic geometry and systems thinking, offering a fresh perspective on AI development.

### 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art:**  
Currently, AI development is dominated by a few tech giants, leading to significant power imbalances. Existing solutions often lack transparency and accountability, resulting in ethical concerns and societal risks.

**Key Players:**  
Key players include major tech corporations, regulatory bodies, and academic institutions. However, there is a notable absence of community-driven initiatives that prioritize public interest.

**Limitations and Gaps:**  
Existing solutions often fail to address the ethical implications of AI and the need for community involvement in governance. There is a lack of frameworks that facilitate decentralized decision-making in AI development.

**Regulatory Considerations:**  
The project will consider existing regulations around data privacy and AI ethics, ensuring compliance while advocating for more robust frameworks that promote decentralization.

**Technological Advancements:**  
Recent advancements in blockchain and decentralized technologies make this project feasible and relevant. The growing public awareness of AI's risks also creates a favorable environment for our initiative.

**Challenging Current Paradigms:**  
Our project will challenge the prevailing notion that AI must be controlled by centralized entities, advocating instead for a model that empowers individuals and communities.

### 3. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novelty of Approach:**  
Our approach is groundbreaking in its emphasis on decentralized governance of AI systems, which contrasts sharply with the current centralized models. We will utilize Fuller's principles of "Tensegrity" and "Vector Equilibrium" to design a resilient governance structure.

**Improvement Over Alternatives:**  
Unlike existing models that prioritize corporate interests, our framework will prioritize community engagement and transparency, ensuring that AI technologies serve the public good.

**Technologies and Methodologies:**
