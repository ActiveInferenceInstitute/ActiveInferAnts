# Grant Proposal for Systems2024: Reimagining AI Governance to Mitigate Power Concentration

## I. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
Our project addresses the urgent challenge of AI-driven power concentration, which threatens individual agency and democratic governance. The rapid advancement of AI technologies has the potential to centralize control among a select few, leading to societal inequities and diminished public participation. We aim to explore innovative frameworks for "Public AI" that prioritize accountability and democratization, ensuring that AI serves the collective good rather than reinforcing existing power structures.

**Project Purpose**  
The purpose of our initiative is to develop a comprehensive model for public AI systems that empower individuals and communities, fostering a more equitable distribution of technological benefits. We will articulate this vision through interdisciplinary conversations and workshops, engaging diverse stakeholders in the co-creation of solutions.

**Inspiration**  
This project was inspired by the recognition that language and technology co-evolve, shaping our perceptions and possibilities for action. As articulated in our core theme of "languaging in action," we believe that reimagining the relationship between technology and society is essential to counteracting the risks posed by AI.

**Alignment with Mission**  
Our initiative aligns with Systems2024’s mission to promote systems literacy and responsibility in technology development. By emphasizing ethical technology design and socio-technical co-evolution, we seek to advance knowledge and practice in the field of AI governance.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a framework for public AI systems that includes specifications for accountability and transparency.
2. Conduct three interdisciplinary workshops with at least 100 participants each, fostering collaborative dialogue.
3. Produce a comprehensive report outlining findings and recommendations for policymakers and technologists.

**Advancing Knowledge**  
This project will advance knowledge in AI governance by integrating systems science with ethical considerations, providing a roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.

## II. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art**  
Currently, AI development is predominantly controlled by a handful of corporations, leading to significant power imbalances. While there are emerging discussions around open-source AI, these efforts often fail to address the underlying issues of power concentration.

**Key Players and Thought Leaders**  
Key players include major tech corporations, academic institutions, and civil society organizations advocating for ethical AI. Thought leaders in this space emphasize the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems.

**Limitations and Gaps**  
Existing solutions often lack a robust framework for public accountability, leading to a gap in effective governance mechanisms. Many initiatives focus on technical aspects without addressing the socio-political implications of AI.

**Regulatory Considerations**  
Regulatory frameworks for AI are still in their infancy, and there are significant ethical considerations regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and surveillance.

**Relevance of Project**  
Recent societal shifts, including growing public concern over privacy and surveillance, make this project timely. The increasing recognition of AI's impact on democracy underscores the need for innovative governance models.

**Challenging Current Paradigms**  
Our project challenges the prevailing paradigm of corporate control over AI by advocating for public ownership and accountability, positioning AI as a tool for collective empowerment rather than concentration of power.

## III. Innovation and Methodological Approach

**Novel Approach**  
Our approach is groundbreaking in its emphasis on "Public AI," which prioritizes community engagement and accountability over corporate interests. We will leverage systems thinking to design participatory frameworks that empower individuals.

**Differentiation from Alternatives**  
Unlike existing models that focus solely on technical solutions, our initiative integrates ethical considerations and public participation, ensuring that AI development aligns with societal values.

**Technologies and Methodologies**  
We will utilize interactive presentations, workshops, and virtual contributions to engage diverse stakeholders. Our methodological framework will include cybernetic languaging and situational enactments to facilitate meaningful dialogue.

**Preliminary Studies**  
We have conducted preliminary workshops that revealed a strong interest in public AI frameworks, indicating a readiness among stakeholders to engage in this discourse.

**Scalability and Adaptability**  
The proposed framework is designed to be scalable, allowing for adaptation across various contexts and communities. Our interdisciplinary approach will facilitate collaboration among diverse stakeholders.

**Interdisciplinary Collaborations**  
We will collaborate with experts in systems science, ethics, and technology policy to ensure a holistic approach to AI governance.
