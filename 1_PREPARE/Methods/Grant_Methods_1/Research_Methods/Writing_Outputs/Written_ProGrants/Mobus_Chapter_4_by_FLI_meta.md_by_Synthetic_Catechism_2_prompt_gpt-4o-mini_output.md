# Grant Proposal for the Future of Life Institute (FLI)

## Comprehensive Project Catechism

**1. Project Essence and Vision**

- **Core Problem or Opportunity:** Our project addresses the urgent need for a systems-based approach to understanding and mitigating the risks associated with advanced technologies, particularly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and biotechnology. As these technologies evolve, they present complex challenges that require a holistic understanding of their interactions with societal structures and natural ecosystems.

- **Project Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates systems thinking and cybernetic principles to analyze and guide the development of transformative technologies. This framework will enable stakeholders to navigate the complexities of technology's impact on life and promote ethical, sustainable practices.

- **Inspiration for the Project:** The project was inspired by the recognition that traditional approaches to technology governance are often inadequate in addressing the emergent properties and feedback loops inherent in complex adaptive systems. The need for a paradigm shift towards systems literacy and interdisciplinary collaboration is more pressing than ever.

- **Alignment with Mission:** This initiative aligns with FLI's mission to steer transformative technologies towards benefiting life and mitigating risks. By emphasizing systems thinking and adaptive systems, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of technology, society, and the environment.

- **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):**
  1. Develop a systems-based framework for assessing the risks and benefits of advanced technologies by Q2 2025.
  2. Conduct workshops and training sessions on systems literacy for 500 stakeholders by Q4 2025.
  3. Publish a comprehensive report on the findings and recommendations by Q1 2026.

- **Advancing Knowledge and Practice:** This project will advance knowledge in the field of technology governance by providing a novel framework that integrates systems science with ethical technology design, ultimately contributing to the development of resilient socio-technical systems.

**2. Current Landscape Analysis**

- **Current State of the Art:** The current landscape in technology governance often relies on linear models that fail to account for the complexity and dynamism of advanced technologies. While there are efforts to address AI safety and ethical considerations, many frameworks lack a comprehensive understanding of systems dynamics.
