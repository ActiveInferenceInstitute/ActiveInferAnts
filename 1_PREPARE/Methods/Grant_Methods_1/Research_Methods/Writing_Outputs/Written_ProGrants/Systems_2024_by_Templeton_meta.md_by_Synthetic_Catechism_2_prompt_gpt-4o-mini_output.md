# Grant Proposal for Systems2024: Exploring the Intersections of Language, Technology, and Society

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
Our project addresses the pressing need for a deeper understanding of the interplay between language, technology, and societal structures. In a world increasingly shaped by technological advancements, the ways in which we communicate and interact with these systems are critical to fostering resilience and sustainability.

**Project Purpose**  
We aim to explore how language shapes our perceptions and interactions within complex systems, thereby enhancing systems literacy and promoting ethical technology design. Our initiative seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications in cybernetics and systems science.

**Inspiration**  
The project was inspired by the recognition that language is not merely a tool for communication but a fundamental driver of human action and societal evolution. As articulated in our core themes, "Language conditions how observers perceive the world in which they live and their possibilities for action."

**Alignment with Mission**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to promote systems thinking and interdisciplinary conversations. By reimagining technicity, we aim to understand the co-evolution of technology and society, fostering a holistic perspective that resonates with the John Templeton Foundation's commitment to exploring life's big questions.

**Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop an experimental glossary that captures key concepts in cybernetics and systems science.
2. Conduct interactive workshops that engage diverse audiences in exploring language and technology.
3. Publish a proceedings volume documenting our findings and discussions.

**Advancement of Knowledge**  
This project will advance knowledge by integrating insights from cybernetics, linguistics, and technology studies, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how these domains interact and influence human flourishing.

## 2. Current Landscape Analysis

**State of the Art**  
Current research in cybernetics and systems science often overlooks the critical role of language in shaping systems dynamics. While there are key players in the field, such as the American Society for Cybernetics, there remains a gap in interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate linguistic perspectives.
