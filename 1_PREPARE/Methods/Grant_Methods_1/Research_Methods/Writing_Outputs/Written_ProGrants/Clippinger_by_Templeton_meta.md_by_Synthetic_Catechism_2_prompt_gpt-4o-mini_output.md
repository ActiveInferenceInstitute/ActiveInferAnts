# Grant Proposal for the John Templeton Foundation

## 1. Project Essence and Vision

**Core Problem and Opportunity**  
Our project addresses the critical challenge of understanding and enhancing human cognition through the lens of active inference and complexity science. As AI systems become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, there is a pressing need to develop frameworks that align these technologies with human values and ethical considerations. This initiative presents an opportunity to explore the intersection of AI, cognitive science, and human flourishing, aligning with the Foundation’s focus on big questions and human sciences.

**Articulation of Purpose**  
The purpose of this project is to develop a principled framework for understanding cognition that is rooted in biological intelligence and the Free Energy Principle. We aim to create a model that not only advances AI but also promotes individual flourishing and ethical decision-making.

**Inspiration for the Project**  
Inspired by the transformative work of Carl Friston on active inference, we recognize the potential of this framework to revolutionize our understanding of cognition and behavior. This project was initiated to explore how these principles can be applied to create AI systems that enhance rather than detract from human life.

**Alignment with Mission and Values**  
This initiative aligns with our mission to rethink institutional design and governance through a life-centric paradigm. By focusing on the ethical implications of AI and its role in human flourishing, we embody the Foundation’s values of curiosity, humility, and interdisciplinary inquiry.

**Primary Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**  
1. Develop a comprehensive framework for understanding cognition based on active inference.
   - Key Result: Publish three peer-reviewed articles on the application of active inference in cognitive science.
2. Create a prototype AI system that embodies these principles.
   - Key Result: Achieve a 20% improvement in ethical decision-making metrics in pilot studies.
3. Engage with interdisciplinary stakeholders to foster dialogue on the implications of AI for human flourishing.
   - Key Result: Host two international conferences with diverse participants from science, philosophy, and theology.

**Advancement of Knowledge**  
This project will advance knowledge in cognitive science, AI ethics, and institutional design, providing a robust framework for understanding human cognition that can be applied across various domains.
