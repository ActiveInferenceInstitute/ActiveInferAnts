### Summary of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) Solicitation (NSF 24-591)

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) aims to enhance the quality, vitality, and diversity of the U.S. scientific and engineering workforce. The program supports outstanding graduate students pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) or STEM education. The GRFP provides three years of financial support over a five-year fellowship period for individuals demonstrating significant research potential.

#### Program Description
The GRFP is designed to recruit and support individuals who can contribute significantly to STEM fields. It encourages applications from a diverse range of candidates, particularly those from underrepresented and underserved communities. The program emphasizes broadening participation in STEM by recognizing the unique experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds and addressing barriers to inclusion.

#### Award Information
- **Type of Award**: Fellowship
- **Estimated Number of Awards**: Up to 2,300 annually, pending funding availability.
- **Funding Amount**: Each fellowship provides a stipend of $37,000 per year and a $16,000 cost of education allowance to the institution, totaling approximately $159,000 over three years.

#### Eligibility Information
**Applicant Eligibility**:
- Must be a U.S. citizen, national, or permanent resident.
- Must intend to enroll or be enrolled full-time in a research-based master's or doctoral program in an eligible STEM field.
- Cannot have previously accepted or declined a GRFP or applied while enrolled in a graduate program.
- Must have completed no more than one academic year in a graduate program.

**Institution Eligibility**:
- Applications must be submitted by the prospective Fellow through the GRFP Application Module in Research.gov.
- Applicants must enroll in a non-profit, accredited institution in the U.S. or its territories by the fall of the award year.

#### Application Preparation and Submission Instructions
Applications must be submitted online through the GRFP Application Module by the specified deadlines, which vary by field of study. Key components of the application include:
- Personal information and education history.
- Official transcripts.
- Proposed field(s) of study.
- Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement (maximum of three pages).
- Graduate Research Plan Statement (maximum of two pages).
- Reference letters from non-family members (at least two required).

#### Application Review Information
Applications are evaluated based on two primary criteria:
1. **Intellectual Merit**: The potential to advance knowledge within the field.
2. **Broader Impacts**: The potential to benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Reviewers assess the applicant's educational and research record, leadership, outreach, and future plans.

#### Award Administration Information
Fellowships are awarded to the institution where the Fellow is enrolled, which is responsible for managing the funds and disbursing the stipend. Awardees must accept the fellowship by the deadline specified in the award notification letter.

#### Reporting Requirements
Fellows must submit annual activity reports and declare their fellowship status each year. They are also required to acknowledge NSF support in any publications resulting from their research.
