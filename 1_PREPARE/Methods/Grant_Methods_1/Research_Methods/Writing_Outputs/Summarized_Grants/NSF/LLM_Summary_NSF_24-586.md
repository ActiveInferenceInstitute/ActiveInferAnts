### Summary of NSF 24-586: NSF National Quantum Virtual Laboratory - Quantum Testbeds (NQVL) Program Solicitation

#### Introduction
The National Science Foundation (NSF) has issued the NSF 24-586 solicitation to advance the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) initiative, specifically focusing on the Quantum Science and Technology Demonstrations (QSTD) in the Design and Implementation phases. This solicitation aims to foster the development of quantum technologies that can provide practical solutions to real-world problems, aligning with the goals of the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act.

#### Program Description
The NQVL is designed as a shared infrastructure to facilitate the translation of basic quantum science research into applicable technologies. It emphasizes the integration of diverse talents from various sectors, including academia, industry, and government, to accelerate the adoption of quantum technologies. The program is structured around three main components:

1. **NQVL:QSTD** - Focuses on the scientific and engineering core of quantum technology projects, progressing through Pilot, Design, and Implementation phases.
2. **NQVL:TAQS** - Supports the development of enabling technologies identified by QSTD projects.
3. **NQVL:Central** - Acts as a coordination hub to promote collaboration and community engagement.

The current solicitation specifically invites proposals for the Design and Implementation phases of QSTD projects, building on previously established Pilot projects.

#### Proposal Requirements
Proposals for the Design phase must be based on a successful Pilot project and a positive recommendation from a Conceptual Design Review. Similarly, Implementation proposals require a successful Design project and a favorable Preliminary Design Review. Each proposal must demonstrate a clear pathway to achieving quantum advantage, detailing the scientific goals, user community engagement, and education and workforce development strategies.

#### Award Information
The NSF anticipates making up to 14 awards under this solicitation, with an estimated funding amount of $32 million. The funding structure is as follows:

- **QSTD:Design**: Up to $2 million per year for a maximum of two years.
- **QSTD:Implementation**: Up to $10 million per year for a maximum of six years.

The number of awards will depend on the quality of proposals and the availability of appropriated funds.

#### Eligibility Information
Eligible proposers include organizations that have successfully completed a QSTD:Pilot project. Each organization can submit only one proposal per phase, and individuals may serve as PI or co-PI on only one proposal. There are no restrictions on the type of organization that can serve as the Lead Organization.

#### Proposal Preparation and Submission Instructions
Proposals must adhere to the NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) and can be submitted via Research.gov or Grants.gov. Key components of the proposal include:

- A detailed Project Execution Plan (PEP) for the Design phase, including a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and risk assessment.
- For the Implementation phase, proposals must demonstrate readiness for system integration and include refined budget estimates based on external information.

#### Review and Selection Process
Proposals will undergo a rigorous merit review process based on two primary criteria: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts. Review panels will evaluate the scientific goals, feasibility, project management plans, and the potential societal benefits of the proposed projects. Additional criteria specific to the Design and Implementation phases will also be considered.

#### Reporting and Award Administration
Award recipients will be required to submit annual project reports and a final project outcomes report. The NSF will monitor progress through site visits and reviews, ensuring accountability and alignment with project goals.

#### Conclusion
The NSF 24-586 solicitation represents a significant opportunity for researchers and organizations to contribute to the advancement of quantum technologies through structured, collaborative efforts. By fostering a community-driven approach, the NQVL aims to bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, ultimately enhancing the United States' leadership in quantum science and technology.
