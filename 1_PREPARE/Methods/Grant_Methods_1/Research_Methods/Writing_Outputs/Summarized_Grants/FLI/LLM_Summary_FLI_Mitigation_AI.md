# Summary of Grant Application: FLI's New Grants to Oppose and Mitigate AI-Driven Power Concentration

## I. Introduction

The Future of Life Institute (FLI) has initiated a new grants program aimed at addressing the pressing issue of power concentration driven by artificial intelligence (AI). With a total funding pool of up to $4 million, this program seeks to support innovative projects that mitigate the risks associated with AI's potential to centralize power among a small number of entities. The overarching goal is to foster a future where AI enhances human agency rather than diminishes it, thereby ensuring a more equitable distribution of power and resources.

## II. Context and Rationale

The rapid advancement of AI technologies poses significant risks of power concentration, which could lead to various detrimental outcomes. These include:

- **Government Surveillance**: The potential for governments to utilize AI for extensive surveillance and control, leading to a loss of individual freedoms and democratic participation.
- **Corporate Monopolies**: The emergence of powerful AI corporations that could dominate entire industries, stifling competition and limiting economic opportunities for the broader population.
- **Autonomous AI Systems**: The risk of AI systems becoming so advanced that they operate independently of human oversight, potentially leading to scenarios where human agency is severely compromised.

FLI emphasizes the need to rethink our institutions and technological development to ensure AI serves humanity positively. The institute advocates for a vision where AI can unlock unprecedented levels of human agency and cooperation, rather than exacerbate existing inequalities.

## III. Areas of Focus

The grants program invites proposals that align with FLI's vision of countering AI-driven power concentration. Potential topics for projects include, but are not limited to:

1. **Public AI Development**: Exploring models for AI that prioritize public control and accountability, diverging from traditional corporate frameworks.
2. **Individual-Centric AI Assistants**: Designing AI systems that serve individual users, counterbalancing corporate dominance.
3. **Safe Decentralization**: Investigating governance structures that decentralize AI management while preventing the proliferation of high-risk systems.
4. **Open Source Effectiveness**: Analyzing the role of open-source initiatives in either mitigating or exacerbating power concentration.
5. **Income Redistribution**: Proposing frameworks for redistributing wealth and resources in an economy increasingly characterized by unvalued labor.
6. **Incentive Structures**: Designing systems that prioritize societal benefits over profit maximization, learning from past industrial failures.
7. **Infrastructure Development**: Equipping societies with the necessary tools and knowledge to translate AI insights into products that genuinely meet human needs.
8. **Legal Mechanisms**: Developing legal frameworks to address potential abuses of power within the AI sector.

FLI explicitly states that proposals should not merely replicate existing anti-concentration mechanisms or overlook the rapid advancements in AI capabilities. Projects should focus on innovative solutions that address the unique challenges posed by AI.

## IV. Evaluation Criteria and Eligibility

Grants ranging from $1 million to $4 million will be awarded to non-profit institutions, civil society organizations, and academic entities for projects lasting up to three years. The number of grants awarded will depend on the quality of applications received, which will undergo a competitive peer review process. 

Key evaluation criteria include:

- **Relevance**: Alignment with the goals of mitigating AI-driven power concentration.
- **Expected Impact**: The potential of the project to effect meaningful change in the landscape of AI governance and power distribution.

Eligible applicants must provide a comprehensive project proposal that includes:

1. Contact information and tax-exempt status documentation.
2. A concise project summary and impact statement.
3. A statement of the applicant's track record.
4. A detailed project description (maximum of 8 pages).
5. A budget with justification.
6. Curricula vitae for senior project personnel.

## V. Application Process

Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, with two review rounds scheduled for July 30, 2024, and September 15, 2024. The application must be submitted in English, and international applicants are welcome. The maximum allowable overhead for grant administration is set at 15%.

## VI. Background on FLI

Founded in 2014, the Future of Life Institute is an independent non-profit organization dedicated to steering transformative technologies towards positive outcomes while mitigating large-scale risks. FLI's focus areas include advanced AI, bio-risk, nuclear threats, and biodiversity preservation. The current grants initiative is part of FLI's broader Futures Program, which aims to realize aspirational futures through sustainable development goals and effective AI governance.

## VII. Conclusion

FLI's new grants program represents a proactive approach to addressing the challenges posed by AI-driven power concentration. By funding innovative projects that prioritize human agency and equitable power distribution, FLI seeks to foster a future where AI technologies enhance rather than undermine societal well-being. The program invites diverse stakeholders to contribute to this critical endeavor, ensuring that the benefits of AI are shared broadly across society.
