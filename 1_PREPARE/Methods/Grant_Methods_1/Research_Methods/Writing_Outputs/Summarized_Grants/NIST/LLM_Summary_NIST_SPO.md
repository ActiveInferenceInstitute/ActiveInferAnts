### Additional Programs and Initiatives

#### Forensic Science Program

The SPO also oversees the Forensic Science Program, which aims to improve the scientific quality of forensic practices through standards development. This program is critical for ensuring the integrity of forensic evidence in the judicial system.

#### Greenhouse Gas Measurement Program

The NIST Greenhouse Gas Measurement Program focuses on accurate measurement and monitoring of greenhouse gases, contributing to better-informed policies for climate change mitigation.

#### Open Data Program

The Open Data Program facilitates the accessibility of NIST's research outputs, including datasets, software, and publications. This initiative is vital for promoting transparency and collaboration in scientific research.

### Research Outputs and Public Access

NIST is committed to making the results of federally funded research publicly accessible. The agency has established a framework for the deposit of scientific data and peer-reviewed publications in publicly accessible databases. This commitment enhances the visibility and utility of NIST's research outputs, which include:

- **Peer-reviewed publications**: 4,787
- **NIST-published reports**: 15,161
- **Datasets**: 593
- **Software**: 851

NIST collaborates with various repositories to ensure that its research is widely disseminated and accessible to stakeholders, including businesses and the public.

### Professional Research Experience Program (PREP)

The PREP provides valuable laboratory experience and financial assistance to researchers at various stages of their careers. This program aims to develop a diverse pool of scientists and engineers to support NIST's mission in measurement science and standards research. It emphasizes the recruitment and retention of historically marginalized groups in STEM fields.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the NIST Special Programs Office is instrumental in advancing U.S. competitiveness and innovation through its comprehensive programs and initiatives. By fostering collaboration across sectors and focusing on critical areas such as advanced manufacturing and cybersecurity, the SPO is positioned to address current and future national priorities effectively. The commitment to public access and transparency further enhances the impact of NIST's research, ensuring that it serves as a valuable resource for the nation and beyond.
